   <HEADLINE> TRENDS ; NEW TECHNOLOGY ON MACHINES AND SERGERS MAKES SEWING FASTER AND EASIER . SO GO_BACK TO SPOOL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Home sewing has gone high-tech . A new generation of machines has tiny computer_screens , track balls and interchangeable pro grams . They can switch from straight stitch to buttonholes to fancy embroidery without complicated attachments . Then there ' s the serger , a smaller machine that uses_up to five cone-shaped spools of thread at once . Sound intimidating ? Perhaps . But those who have made the leap to computerized machines and sergers say sewing has never been easier or more exciting . Such enthusiasm for the new machines is a godsend for the home-sewing industry , which has suffered from lax sales and declining consumer interest since the 1970s . But now the American Home Sewing &amp; Craft Assn . is preparing to revamp sewing ' s homespun image -- actress / model Lauren Hutton has been hired as national spokeswoman -- and attract new recruits . A particular emphasis will be placed on home decor , because pillows , drapes and bed fashions are easy projects for beginners and make the coveted &quot; designer look &quot; affordable . So what are these new machines , and why should those with little time to sew be excited about them ? First , there ' s the serger , which sews seams at 1 # 500 stitches per minute , trims off excess fabric and finishes raw edges all_in one pass . Sergers have been around for more_than 40 years in commercial sewing operations , but scaled-down versions for the home were developed within the past 10 years . In addition to sewing faster , the serger makes a stronger seam than conventional sewing_machines . Its system of needles and loopers forms a network of interlocking stitches that extend over the edge of the seam , which is why the serger is sometimes called an overlock machine . A similar seam sewn on top of the fabric is called a flatlock , commonly seen on T-shirts , sweat shirts and exercise wear . Slow to catch_on , the serger is now considered indispensable by many home-sewing enthusiasts . &quot; I use mine constantly , &quot; said Sherri Wolf , who teaches home-decorating sewing at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo . &quot; It ' s 10 times faster and makes things so_much easier . Once you own one , you ' ll sew more , &quot; said Wolf , who is making drapes for her home almost exclusively on a serger . &quot; I would have never attempted this without it. &quot; For everyone who has wrestled with keeping even one spool of thread and one bobbin operating in concert , the serger with its four to five spools of thread can seem daunting . Although an experienced seamstress , Wolf admits to being intimidated at first by the serger ' s multiple threads and complicated appearance . &quot; But once I got started on it , I couldn ' t live without it . The serger makes sewing so_much easier that I can take_on twice as_many projects , &quot; said Wolf , who also teaches a course in overcoming serger phobia at Piecemakers Country_Store in Costa Mesa . Her simple approach has helped numerous serger owners understand the machine ' s threading and tension process . &quot; It ' s a matter of knowing where each thread goes and what its purpose is in creating the seam , &quot; Wolf said . &quot; A simple rule_of_thumb when adjusting tension is to tighten what appears too loose and loosen what appears too tight . Everyone catches_on with a little practice and understanding. &quot; Using a serger , you can sew a ruffled pillow sham in minutes because the serger ' s ruffling attachment will gather the fabric evenly as you sew , attach the ruffle and finish the seam all at once . The same process is used for sewing bed ruffles and valances . Another home-decorating advantage is the serger ' s ability to sew a wider range of fabrics , including drapery sheers and medium-weight upholstery_materials . In fact , the machine ' s narrow , rolled-edge stitch is often used to give ruffled curtain sheers the delicate , billowy appearance of custom-sewn draperies . Use of the serger ' s differential feed option allows the user to sew straight and even stitches on lightweight fabrics with no puckering . However amazing the serger may seem , it can ' t do_it all . For example , it doesn ' t do buttonholes or zippers . Sergers were designed to be used in tandem with conventional sewing_machines , in which there are also many new developments . Traditional sewing machine_stitches are made by a mechanical cam linked to the sewing machine needle . Most are capable of only 40 kinds of stitches . In computerized machines , the cam is replaced by a tiny computer chip , allowing a wider variety of stitch options and , in some machines , memory storage for custom-designed stitches . The state-of-the-art Bernina 1630 computerized machine , for example , contains five pre-programmed alphabets , motifs and decorative borders that can be embroidered onto clothing and table and bed_linens at the touch of a_few buttons . For those who want to design their own embellishments , the machine will allow you to &quot; sketch &quot; the stitch on its display screen using the machine ' s track ball , a process similar to drawing_on a computer_screen using a mouse . In fact , many computerized machines will eventually allow users to do just that . Manufacturers are devising ways to link sewing_machines to the home PC , allowing users to scan in or draw a design to be stitched on the machine . Custom-designed stitches can be stored in the machine ' s memory . &quot; The computerized machines are more expensive , but they are easy to use and provide many options , &quot; said Steve Ferris , a mechanical_engineer and owner of Capistrano Sewing_Machine and Vacuum Co . in San Juan Capistrano . &quot; They also have a direct_current motor , which allows you to work_on thicker fabrics , even at low speeds. &quot; Most computerized machines come_with an electronic sensor device that tells the user when the bobbin is running_low . Another sensor automatically adjusts tension according to fabric and stitch selection . A user-friendly tutorial appears on the machine ' s display screen to inform the user how to use the machine ' s features . It also indicates which presser foot to use according to the stitch selected . &quot; The computerized machines give the user a chance to be creative in a way that ' s not possible on a regular machine , &quot; Ferris said . &quot; People tend to rediscover sewing when they learn what their new machine is capable of. &quot; That attitude is precisely what the Home Sewing &amp; Craft Assn . is hoping will bring new energy to the industry . Whether you sew occasionally or often , you will probably enjoy checking out the new machines . It ' s likely you ' ll see machines with features you never dreamed of , especially if you purchased your current machine 10 or more years ago . While sewing ultimately is still the process of attaching pieces of fabric one to another , the machines to do_it have changed dramatically . Basic Machine_Stitch Seam sewn by conventional sewing_machine using two threads , one top and one bottom , that interlock at even intervals . Edge is left unfinished . All-purpose stitch used on cottons and other fabrics that dont unravel easily . Serger Safety Stitch Four-thread seam sewn by a serger . The top row of stitching overlocks the unfinished edge on both sides of the fabric . A separate row of stitching runs underneath , forming a stable , lightweight seam . Often used on woven fabrics , such_as woolens . Serger Mock Safety Stitch Variation of a four-thread safety stitch . The fabric edge is overlocked on both sides , and a safety stitch runs_down the middle of the seam , instead of below it . Allows the fabric to stretch while providing additional stability . Used primarily on knits . Sewing_Machines The person who sews in the ' 90s has a range of machines available . Three basic types and what each does : SERGER Sews seam , trims fabric and finishes seam edge_in one pass Up to 1 # 500 stitches per minute Stronger , commercial quality seam with three or more threads instead of two Wide range of fabrics including lightweight sheers and medium-weight upholstery More suitable for knit fabrics , due_to strength and flexibility of seam Cost : $ 500- $ 1 # 500 COMPUTERIZED MACHINE Wide range of stitches , including multiple alphabets , motifs and numerals Up to 1 # 000 stitches per minute Uses two threads Sews heavy fabrics , even at slow speeds Some allow users to design own stitches and embroidery motifs Attachments becoming available for some models that allow link to personal_computer Cost : $ 1 # 000- $ 3 # 500 REGULAR MACHINE * Sews straight stitch , zig-zag and approximately 20 decorative stitches * Sews 200-1 # 000 stitches per minute * Uses two threads * Cannot handle extra-thick fabrics * Lower price ( $ 200- $ 800 ) makes this good machine for occasional sewers Source : Individual manufacturers ; Researched by JANICE L . JONES / Los Angeles Times Buying Tips Here are some things to consider when shopping for a serger or computerized sewing_machine : * Shop around : Don ' t assume that the manufacturer of your old-reliable sewing_machine also makes a quality serger or computerized machine . Try_out several brands and ask knowledgeable friends which they prefer . * Price : Expect to pay $ 500 to $ 1 # 500 for a quality serger . Computerized sewing_machines run $ 1 # 000 to $ 3 # 500 . * Trade-ins : Many people buy less-expensive machines and then trade up_to high-end models when their needs and skills advance . Many dealers accept trade-ins as credit toward a new machine . Used models are often available at one-third to one-half off . * Try it yourself : Bring samples of fabrics you like to work with and ask to sew them yourself on the machine you are considering . Be sure to get a thorough demonstration of the machine . * What to look_for : Machines vary according to quality of stitch and ease of use . Sample all_of the machine ' s features and make notes for comparison among models . Pick one that makes an even , attractive stitch and is relatively simple to use . * Number of threads : Sergers utilizing up_to four threads are fine for beginning to advanced users . Five-thread machines may be overkill , except for specific purposes . * Lessons : Many dealers include lessons on your new machine in the purchase_price . Classes can save hours of frustration and help you get the most out of your investment . * In-house repairs : Dealers who service machines in-house instead of shipping them out for repairs are usually the most knowledgeable , and , should you have a problem , repairs can often be done quickly .
