   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : NEW YORK ; A WALK THROUGH AMERICA ' S MELTING_POT ; IMMIGRANTS PAST AND PRESENT LEAVE A LEGACY ON THE LOWER EAST_SIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In wave after wave , millions of immigrants from throughout the world have swept_through New York City ' s Lower East_Side for more_than a century and a half , bequeathing the neighborhood a rich -- make that notorious -- historic legacy , wonderful ( and inexpensive ) ethnic cafes and teeming streets . Everywhere , touches of the Old_World catch the eye , and yet few places anywhere are so fundamental to the all-American story . Now , as the nation becomes embroiled in a heated debate on its immigration policies and practices , it is a particularly appropriate time to explore this curious , multicultural neighborhood at the southeastern end of Manhattan . Such a visit , if only for a_few hours , is a powerful reminder that this is a nation created mostly by immigrants -- many of whom arrived on these shores uneducated and impoverished and began their hope-filled scramble for a new and better life in the hurly-burly mix of the Lower East_Side . You can go_to the Lower East_Side on_your_own or under the tutelage of expert guides -- I did both -- and what you get is a fascinating history_lesson and plenty of opportunities for ethnic snacking . Over a long weekend recently , I paused for afternoon biscotti and strong espresso in a coffeehouse in Little Italy ; tried my first-ever hot bialy , a sort of doughy bagel , at a flour-on-the-floor bakery in the old Jewish Lower East_Side ; and shared plates of dim sum , the tasty Chinese dumplings , in a crowded little cafe in Chinatown -- which today is the most vibrant and colorful area of the Lower East_Side . Fish markets and vegetable stalls crowd Chinatown ' s sidewalks in a jumble as exotic as Hong Kong . One man garbed in a butcher ' s apron hurried down Mott Street , the heart of Chinatown , carrying what looked_like a freshly skinned lamb over his shoulder . The scent of incense wafted from the Eastern States Buddhist Temple at 64 Mott St. , where I paid a dollar to pluck from a basket a piece_of_paper with a fortune printed on it . The probability of my success , it said , is &quot; poor. &quot; The newly restored Ellis Island Immigration Museum , situated just off the southern tip of Manhattan , has become a very popular tourist site . Overlooking the Statue_of_Liberty , the engaging history museum details the mighty flood of immigrants that entered the United States through the island ' s famous portals . The Lower East_Side is the sometimes-tragic , often-inspirational sequel -- the tale of what happened to the newcomers once they left Ellis Island behind . Both places can be visited in a day trip , but stretching it over two days is better . * As an introduction to the Lower East_Side , I sampled three of the several two-hour walking tours of the neighborhood offered weekends throughout the year by Big Onion Walking Tours . The company is run_by Seth Kamil and Ed O ' Donnell , both Columbia University_students and teachers of immigration history who are helping to pay_for their doctoral studies as tour guides . Kamil , who is Jewish , concentrates_on the Jewish streets of the Lower East_Side -- once the world ' s largest Jewish settlement -- and on the mile-long Bowery , the neighborhood ' s once-bawdy , now mostly run-down thoroughfare . O ' Donnell , who is of Irish descent and a member of the American Irish Historical Society , highlights Irish New York , which includes several churches and the former sites of Tammany_Hall and the old Five Points slum , reputedly the roughest and most crowded in the city in the 19th Century . Kamil and O ' Donnell also sweep in and out of Little Italy , Chinatown and the other overlapping ethnic pockets that together form the Lower East_Side . One of their major themes is how the neighborhood continues to be recycled in a process of decline and rebirth . By Big Onion ' s broad definition -- encompassing Chinatown and Little Italy -- the Lower East_Side roughly covers an area that is bounded on the north by 14th Street , on the south by Chatham Square near City_Hall , on the east by the East_River and on the west by Broadway . The Bowery slices the neighborhood from north to south . Historically , Little Ireland and Little Italy predominated west of the Bowery ; much of the Jewish community was found east of the Bowery . Today , immigrants from many Asian_nations form Chinatown , which is located mostly west of the Bowery . Latino , African and other ethnic_groups have replaced most of the former Jewish residents to the east . The scholarly pair does not overlook the harsh side of life in the Lower East_Side , past and present . Our tour group peered through the window into what Kamil described as a modern-day &quot; sweatshop , &quot; one of many crowded clothing factories where poor immigrants from Southeast_Asia are said to labor at piece work_at below minimum_wages . We also stood_in front of several $ 7- and $ 8-a-night so-called &quot; flophouses &quot; on the Bowery , where the homeless with a_few bucks can rent a room of_their_own . Kamil ' s research suggests the Bowery has been a sanctuary for the homeless since the 19th Century . &quot; The problem is not new , &quot; he says . * On my own , I sought_out the Lower East_Side Tenement Museum , which is restoring two apartments in a six-story brick tenement building at 97 Orchard St. , a street in the Jewish area lined with inexpensive clothing shops and considered one of Manhattan ' s best bargain-hunting districts . Built_in 1863 to house 22 families , the building lacked heat and offered in the way of plumbing only outdoor privies and a water_pump . Historian Suzanne Wasserman , who leads tours of the building , characterizes the tenement as an example of &quot; the worst housing built_in America. &quot; A plaque outside sadly notes that &quot; for millions of immigrants from scores of nations , this tenement and others like it was a place of first settlement in America. &quot; On a cheerier note , the same plaque pays a belated tribute to the tenement residents , who undoubtedly suffered economic , racial or religious discrimination when they were forced to live there . &quot; We salute them , &quot; says the marker , &quot; as our urban pioneers on the municipal frontier. &quot; As the grandson of a Danish immigrant , I added my own quiet salute to the authors of that sentiment . Once the tours were over , I spent hours walking the streets of the Lower East_Side taking_in the unusual sights much as I would in a foreign city -- for , to me , the neighborhood seemed as intriguing . On Orchard Street in the old Jewish community , shopkeepers hang clothing and other merchandise from overhead racks that reach over the sidewalk so thickly they form a pedestrian tunnel . At the Ten Ren Tea and Ginseng Co . at 75 Mott St . in Chinatown , I saw imported teas that sell for as much as $ 130 a pound . A clerk offered_up a sample of tart plum tea , priced at considerably less . At the Pearl River Mart , a Chinese department_store at 277 Canal St. , I almost bought a giant , papier-mache dragon head -- the brightly painted sort one would wear as a dragon in a Chinese New Year parade . * Big Onion ' s weekend walking tours cost $ 9 per person , and no reservations are needed . You simply show_up at the appointed meeting_place -- which can be the entrance to City_Hall , a famous statue or , on Kamil ' s excursion into &quot; Immigrant New York , &quot; the entrance to the Olympia Restaurant at Essex and Delancey streets . The tour is a multiethnic stroll through the Jewish Lower East_Side , Chinatown , Little Italy and what used to be called Little Germany , Little Africa and Little Ireland . The emphasis is_on the contribution the immigrants made to New York , and to the nation . This particular tour wraps into a single , two-hour package a portion of the itineraries Big Onion covers in more detail in some of its other tours , such_as &quot; Jewish Lower East_Side , &quot; &quot; The Bowery &quot; and &quot; Irish New York. &quot; The &quot; Immigrant &quot; tour , which I took_in December , whetted my appetite , and on a return visit to New York recently I also joined Kamil ' s &quot; Bowery &quot; tour and followed O ' Donnell through &quot; Irish New York. &quot; In the early 1910s , Essex and Delancey streets formed the heart of the Jewish settlement , explained Kamil on the initial tour . More_than half a_million Jewish immigrants from Europe lived_in the community . It soon became an overcrowded slum with residents packed into dark , unhealthy tenements . Today , no more_than 11 # 000 Jews reside in the area . Many of the old tenement buildings , like the Tenement Museum , are still standing but are boarded_up . But a number of Jewish-owed shops remain in business . Undoubtedly , the most famous of them is Guss ' s Pickles at 35 Essex St. , which was prominently featured in the movie &quot; Crossing Delancey. &quot; From the Jewish streets , the tour crossed into Chinatown . The first stop , at Hester Street and the Bowery , was &quot; The Wall of Respect for the Working People of Chinatown. &quot; It is a vivid , two-story mural on the wall of a brick building that portrays a giant dragon . At its tail are scenes of laborers at_work in the rice fields of Asia ; at its head are depicted the many occupations Asian immigrants have tackled in their new homeland -- waiter , cook , seamstress , laborer and student , among them . Here Kamil paused to offer_up a brief history of the Bowery , which is the subject of his academic dissertation . In New York ' s early years , the Bowery was the city ' s finest street . But in the 19th Century , as European immigrants poured in , it became a bawdy area of saloons , brothels and inexpensive theaters . As a kid in the ' 40s , I was a fan of &quot; The Bowery Boys &quot; movies , which depicted the Bowery as lively and exciting . For much of its mile length today , however , it is a way-stop for the homeless ; Kamil said he has counted 16 flophouses on the Bowery . But there also are bright spots to tempt visitors . At the north end , Amato Opera at 319 Bowery , a tiny little opera_house , is in its 46th season , and all seats ( weekends only ) are just $ 16 . At the southern end , near Chatham Square , is the city ' s &quot; lighting district , &quot; a_couple_of blocks where most of the shops sell lamps and chandeliers of all types . This was once Little Ireland , and Kamil pointed down Pell Street , as O ' Donnell does on his Irish tour , to Pell ' s Dinty , an old Irish saloon that is now Chinese owned . On a big sign out front , the original name is printed in small_letters beneath larger Chinese characters . Chinatown , which is growing , is the largest Chinese-American community in America , and in many ways it looks more like the old_country than the new . Street_lamps are topped with pagoda-like caps , and street_signs all carry Chinese characters beneath the name in English . Mott Street is the main_street , but adjacent streets are almost as colorful . At Grand Street , Chinatown gives_way to the remnants of Little Italy , now primarily a three-block-long strip of Italian restaurants , coffeehouses , bakeries and other food_shops along Mulberry Street . Kamil ended our &quot; Immigrants &quot; tour at Caffe Roma at Mulberry and Broome streets . The Big Onion duo regards this old-fashioned coffeehouse as the best place in Little Italy for Italian pastries and cappuccino , and I won ' t argue with them . I ' ve been back three times now . I left the Lower East_Side with a troubled mind , which I suppose is what the Big Onion team and the Tenement Museum hoped would happen . As we debate the nation ' s immigration policy , it is a good thing to be reminded that not so_long ago millions of impoverished newcomers endured the hardships of the Lower East_Side and then went_on to contribute to the strength of America . Indeed , the process continues today .
