   <HEADLINE> WOMAN WHO KILLED ABUSIVE MATE MAY BE FREED EARLY ; BATTERED SPOUSES : GENEVA LOVE , WHO SHOT HER HUSBAND TO DEATH IN 1988 , STRIKES A PLEA BARGAIN THAT MAY ALLOW HER TO LEAVE PRISON NEXT YEAR . SHE EARLIER HAD SOUGHT CLEMENCY FROM WILSON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A woman who had sought executive_clemency after she killed her abusive husband struck a plea bargain Monday that reduced her 17-years-to-life sentence to 12 years and probably will result in her release from prison sometime next year . Geneva Love , whose petition for clemency to Gov . Pete Wilson had been accompanied by a letter of support from the trial_judge , will finish serving her sentence in the same Arkansas prison where she has been for more_than four years , said her attorney , Christina Cordoza of Monterey . Love , 29 , shot her husband , a Ft . Ord soldier , in 1988 , after what her attorney said was protracted abuse . Wilson , who last year considered more_than a dozen petitions for executive_clemency by women who had killed spouses they said were abusive , singled_out Love ' s case , noting that her record &quot; offers a sympathetic picture of petitioner , but does not produce an easy answer to the question of clemency in her case. &quot; In the current matter , Monterey Superior_Court Judge Richard Silver granted Cordoza ' s writ_of_habeas_corpus , and attorneys worked_out an agreement for Love on Monday to plead to voluntary manslaughter , instead of the second-degree murder_charge of which she was convicted in 1989 . The plea agreement may free_Love from prison sooner than clemency would have . Wilson ' s clemency grant to convicted spouse-killer Brenda Aris last year reduced Aris ' minimum sentence to 11 years from 15 . Love was pregnant with her second child when she killed her husband , Azell . She gave_birth to her second son in prison . Both children are in Arkansas , as are her 13 brothers and sisters , who have worked_on her behalf , circulating petitions of support . An Arkansas state_senator has taken_up her cause , certifying that he will help her find a job and a home when she is released . Cordoza ' s writ had said that Love ' s trial_attorney should have tried to introduce evidence of battered women ' s syndrome and used an expert on the syndrome . The trial_attorney agreed , said Cordoza . At that time , battered women ' s syndrome was still an unsettled area of law , allowed_in some cases and not in others . Two years after Love was convicted of second-degree murder , the state evidence code was amended to allow testimony about the syndrome . Cordoza says the trial_judge , Robert M . Hinrichs of Monterey , had urged Wilson to grant clemency , writing that &quot; if the evidence presented in the application had been presented at the trial , it is very likely that there would have been an acquittal instead of a conviction. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Dennis LaBarbera said Monday that &quot; we would have had a very difficult time putting the case back together &quot; for another trial , with so many witnesses scattered after the closure of Ft . Ord , where Love ' s husband was based . &quot; This was a compromise , &quot; said LaBarbera . &quot; They got something of what they wanted -- a reduction in the charge so she could get_out earlier . We got something we wanted -- at least we preserved a conviction and some of the punishment she ' d get for killing somebody. &quot;</TEXT>
