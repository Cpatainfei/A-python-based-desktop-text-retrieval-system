   <HEADLINE> FAMILY LOVE AND EUTHANASIA ; ' BURKIE ' EXPLORES A DYING MAN ' S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS SON AND DAUGHTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> 1984 . A play opens , first off-Broadway , then in Philadelphia . It explores the trian gular relationship of a father dying of pancreatic_cancer , his doting son and not-so-doting daughter . The father wills himself to die . The reviews make little of this element . 1994 . A play opens in previews tonight in North Hollywood at Theatre Exchange , care of Interact Theatre Company . It explores a father-son-daughter relationship . The father , suffering from pancreatic_cancer , wills himself to die . Same play . Different decades . Bruce Graham wrote his first produced play , &quot; Burkie , &quot; when few knew who Dr. Jack Kevorkian was , when doctor-assisted suicide and euthanasia were hardly topics for civilized conversation . He now says he never intended that issue to dominate the listener ' s mind as it is sorting through the conflicted emotions between father Ed Burke , son Jon and daughter Jess . &quot; His desire to bring an end to things just follows from a life that ' s shutting_down , &quot; says Graham by telephone from Philadelphia , where he is resident playwright at the Philadelphia Festival Theatre . Graham will soon be a big East Valley theater presence when , during the &quot; Burkie &quot; run , Burbank-based Alliance Repertory_Company opens another Graham drama , &quot; Minor Demons. &quot; &quot; The issues of euthanasia and the rest are never even mentioned , &quot; says Eddie Jones , returning to the role of Ed , which he originated_in the off-Broadway production . He is sitting in the front row of the theater with actor Denise Bessette , who plays Jess , and director Kevin Kelley , and considering the scenes they have just finished rehearsing . &quot; It ' s kinda buried in the play , but you know today ' s audiences will be thinking_about it. &quot; Jess , overcompensating for not attending_to her father ' s physical decline while growing her sports-equipment business 2 # 000 miles away in Phoenix , is convinced that a little desert sun therapy will turn things around for Ed . &quot; But his illness has gone way past that , &quot; Bessette says . &quot; She will never capitulate , but as I ' ve thought her through , it ' s no longer about some all-consuming guilt . It ' s about saving him . &quot; But people feel differently now about all_of this , that it ' s best to die with dignity and avoid every last-ditch measure . Now , she has become un-PC , and it ' ll be interesting how she ' s accepted by the audience. &quot; &quot; Jess does all_of the wrong moves for all_the right reasons , &quot; Kelley says , &quot; which makes this play especially human and painful. &quot; The just-finished rehearsal period appeared painful as well , with Kelley going_over minute details with Jones and Bessette . * Does he always take such a micro approach -- this director who , in the past , has specialized in such macro dramatists as Shakespeare for the Shakespeare / LA company ? &quot; No , no , &quot; he quickly says . &quot; There have been many days here with Eddie , Denise , Steven ( Culp , playing Jon ) and Buck ( Kartalian , as neighborhood friend Dom ) when we ' ve taken scenes in big stretches . Other days , I ' ll get_down to very particular things like actions and timing . How I feel about a scene , how it ' s developing , will change my directing approach from day to day. &quot; The &quot; Burkie &quot; company has enjoyed both the comparatively luxurious rehearsal time of five weeks ( compared to the customary three-to-four week process typical in Los Angeles theater ) , and the added sense of , as Bessette puts it , &quot; making this production our own. &quot; &quot; Burkie &quot; marks one of the first times in Interact ' s four-year history that company members have initiated a production of_their_own . &quot; Burkie &quot; is very different from Graham ' s subsequent work . Due_to Graham ' s position as a resident playwright , Bessette says , &quot; he is able to really crank_out work , but most of it isn ' t traditional family drama like this play , but really dark , harsh stuff. &quot; More like &quot; Minor Demons , &quot; says Graham , 37 , who says he has a darker streak than is exhibited in &quot; Burkie , &quot; where &quot; I was dealing with things close to my own life. &quot; &quot; For sure , ' Burkie ' is the most personal thing I ' ve written . I never told my parents about it , and then my dad read the reviews and called me and said , ' Why do I feel_like I ' m reading my damned obituary ? ' . . . But this shouldn ' t be taken as an autobiographical play . . . There ' s a rivalry going_on between brother and sister , but that doesn ' t exist in my life . Jon and I are in no way alike. &quot; Still , the old Philadelphia streets of &quot; Burkie &quot; are very much those of Graham ' s neighborhood . &quot; I ' ll never leave Philly , no way , &quot; says Graham . &quot; I mean , I had an offer to join the staff of ' Roseanne. ' But that meant moving to L.A. Not a chance. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; Burkie. &quot; Location : Interact Theatre Company at Theatre Exchange , 11855 Hart St. , North Hollywood .
