   <HEADLINE> D.A. SEIZES INVESTMENT RECORDS ; CRISIS : FOCUS OF THE ACTION APPEARS TO BE TO SEEK INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT AGENCIES WERE TOLD ABOUT RISKS . OFFICES OF THE O.C. TREASURER AND AUDITOR ARE TARGETED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Armed with search_warrants , investigators from the Orange County district_attorney ' s office scoured the offices of the county ' s treasurer and auditor Monday , launching a criminal probe into the risky investment practices that plunged the county into an unprecedented bankruptcy crisis . Sealing_off the hallway leading to former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron ' s office with yellow crime-scene tape , about 35 investigators -- including some from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the State_Department of Corporations -- combed through files , removing boxes of documents and computers , which were loaded into two vehicles . In a nearby government building , authorities collected audits of the investment portfolio conducted by Auditor-Controller Steve E . Lewis . Investigators , he said , were particularly interested in a 1993 audit that criticized Citron ' s investment strategies and said state laws were being violated . Affidavits supporting the search_warrants are believed to recount interviews between investigators and several city officials around the county , zeroing_in on how cities first became involved in the county pool and whether they were ever warned that the fund was in_trouble . At the treasurer ' s office , investigators appeared to be focusing_on documents that could shed_light_on Citron ' s investments and precisely what cities , schools and special districts with savings in the fund were told about the risks of those investments . Investigators said they would be collecting documents from the treasurer ' s office throughout Monday night and were expected to return today . While the probe continued , these developments took_place Monday : * County officials said they were preparing to cut about 25 % out of this year ' s budget because of the loss of interest revenue . The cuts , however , will not be shared equally among county departments . Public safety and welfare services are a higher priority , officials said . * At the urging of the county ' s management council -- comprised of Dist . Atty . Michael R . Capizzi , Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez , Sheriff Brad Gates and Health Services_Agency Director Tom Uram -- the Superior_Court system offered to trim $ 1 million from its budget , largely by allowing 35 to 45 jobs to remain unfilled , according to Assistant Presiding Judge Ted Millard . Officials in other county departments declined to comment on possible cuts . * Salomon Bros. , the brokerage handling the liquidation of the fund ' s portfolio , said the fund will receive $ 598 million in cash from the $ 1.39 billion raised in last week ' s initial sale . The rest of the proceeds -- $ 792 million -- were used to pay down some of the loans still outstanding to the fund from major brokerage_houses . Meanwhile , the brokerage on Monday sold an additional $ 175 million in securities . * Investors in the county fund learned that property_taxes collected earlier this month will be released Friday to all public agencies . &quot; We ' re seeing step by step that we ' re going to see a resolution to this , &quot; said Blake Anderson , general_manager of the Orange County Sanitation District , which will receive about $ 20 million in property_taxes . * The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had filed a motion that allows it to be a formal part of the bankruptcy proceedings and monitor the distribution of funds . * In Sacramento , a special Senate committee held its first meeting to look_into the Orange County investment debacle and several lawmakers raised doubts that the state can offer much assistance . &quot; I ' ve got a feeling a lot of these local_governments are going_to come_up here with their hands_out and ask us to bail them out , &quot; said Sen . Daniel E . Boatwright ( D-Concord ) . &quot; We don ' t have the money to bail them out . . . . We ' re in a hole. &quot; * The City of Anaheim turned_down an $ 8.5-million disbursement offered by the county because city officials did not want to be restricted to spending the money on emergency payroll and purchasing commitments , officials said . * A federal bankruptcy judge approved $ 126.6 million in disbursements to some investors who sought money from the pool . Among the disbursements were $ 115 million to the Orange County Department_of_Education , community_colleges and other schools , and $ 4.6 million to the Orange County Water District . * At a Huntington Beach City_Council meeting , outgoing Councilman Jim Silva , who will be sworn_in next month as one of two new county supervisors , said his first action will be to propose that the county treasurer be appointed and not elected . Silva said the treasurer should be selected by the county chief administrative officer and approved by the Board of Supervisors . At an impromptu news_conference Monday afternoon , Capizzi said the two search_warrants were the only ones executed in the case so far but refused to rule_out future warrants . Nor would he discuss the scope or aim of his case . &quot; We ' re not giving road maps ( on the investigation ) , past or future , &quot; he said , adding that investigators would not limit their inquiry . The district_attorney ' s office joins a host of other agencies -- including the U.S. attorney ' s office and the Securities and Exchange Commission -- that are examining Citron ' s investments in the wake of the county ' s bankruptcy filing two weeks ago . Much of the investigation focuses_on whether Citron misled investors and whether brokers sought to influence county officials to gain underwriting business by providing them with kickbacks . Terry W . Bird , attorney for Acting Treasurer Matthew R . Raabe , said Monday ' s actions by Capizzi ' s office were unnecessary . &quot; This is not a criminal case . Why he ' s executing search_warrants on the treasurer ' s office , you ' ll have to ask him , &quot; Bird said . &quot; Somebody decided they need to seal it off with a yellow tape . That was not necessary . These people would have given them anything they wanted. &quot; Previously , two district_attorney ' s investigators had been rebuffed in attempts to speak with Raabe . But investigators did talk with finance officials from several cities , including Irvine . City_Manager Paul O . Brady Jr . said they were looking_for any documentation or verbal representations on the risk to their investments made by Citron and Raabe . Lewis , the county auditor-controller , said he had &quot; nothing to fear &quot; from a criminal investigation . &quot; My records are open , &quot; he said . Investigators arrived_at the county offices about 10 a.m. Salomon Bros . officials also were present , said an investigator who declined to be named . At least 13 boxes , numbered and labeled &quot; Treas. , &quot; were loaded into an orange van . Computers and other boxes were loaded into a second vehicle . Also at the scene was Deputy Dist . Atty . William Overtoom , who specializes in prosecuting white-collar crime , including fraud and embezzlement . Overtoom declined to discuss his involvement in the execution of the search_warrants . County employees gathered a short distance from the commotion . &quot; It ' s like a morgue in there : terrible , terrible , terrible , &quot; said Rena Bugbee , a deputy tax_collector . As public agencies continued to cope_with the fallout from the financial crisis , Ron Rus , an attorney who represents six local districts with money tied_up in the fund , described the emergency disbursement of $ 126 million in funds as &quot; a very interim stop-gap measure . &quot; We don ' t view the amount disbursed on Monday as having any significant impact on the interests of other participants in the pool , &quot; Rus added . Priority Sought Meanwhile , officials from some agencies who mistakenly believed their funds were being invested in a separate , safer pool were preparing to argue that they should be among the first in_line to get their money back . All told , the Orange County Transportation Agency , Orange County Sanitation District and 11 other public entities were shown in county documents as having invested $ 1.3 billion in a &quot; bond pool &quot; as distinguished from a &quot; commingled pool. &quot; In actuality , it appears as if Citron pooled all funds in one investment fund comprised of numerous high-risk investments . Particularly stung by the revelation that apparently no safer pool of funds existed was the county sanitation district , which invested about $ 50 million in what officials believed was safe on assurances from Citron . An April 12 , 1993 , letter from Citron to district general_manager J . Wayne Sylvester all but guaranteed that the money would be safe , indicating that it was not going_into a &quot; commingled fund , &quot; but into a separate one with lower risks . &quot; We are doing the district an extreme favor , &quot; Citron said in the letter . &quot; We , therefore , do not want this type of investment transaction disseminated to others. &quot; The confusion over the existence of separate funds was worsened by monthly statements from Citron charting performances for both a &quot; bond pool &quot; and an &quot; investment pool , &quot; the latter believed to have been the higher-risk pool of commingled funds . Stan Oftelie , chief_executive_officer of the Orange County Transportation Authority , said , &quot; We believed that the bond pool had safer , lower yield investments and the commingled pool had riskier investments. &quot; &quot; There are supposed to be two pools , &quot; said Ken Weel , chief financial_officer for the Santa Margarita Water District , one of the 13 agencies . &quot; We got separate statements on each pool. &quot; The distinction between the two funds is significant because , under federal law , the tax-exempt monies that were pumped into the pool by the 13 agencies cannot be used for arbitrage , borrowing to make a profit . In exchange for assuming lower risks , the agencies would receive a lower rate of return . Officials first received indications that their so-called &quot; safe &quot; deposits would be tied_up in the financial mess at an investors meeting Thursday . Officials also questioned the propriety of Citron ' s pooling all_the money in a single fund , thus subjecting them to the same amount of risk , but paying some agencies lower yields . Citron ' s attorney , David Wiechert , did not return telephone_calls Monday . Patrick C . Shea , an attorney with Pillsbury Madison &amp; Sutro , which has been retained by a committee of investors seeking return of their money , said it is unclear how Citron ' s accounting methods will affect the disbursement of funds . Shea said he does not expect the possible claims by some investors that their funds are more secure to disrupt the negotiation process or fracture the investors committee . Unlike committees in other types of bankruptcy filings , &quot; the members of this committee are county agencies and they all live here and they ' re all neighbors forever . It ' s like they ' re all married , &quot; he said . Shea added that he expects all_the investors will receive pro-rated shares of money that came_into county coffers after the bankruptcy declaration was filed , such_as recently received property_tax revenue . School districts were given special assurances from the Board of Supervisors over the weekend that they would receive their fair shares of the property_tax payments , but Shea said other investors should receive the same treatment . Anaheim Decision While municipalities throughout the county clamored for cash , Bret Colson , spokesman for the City of Anaheim , said officials there turned_down an $ 8.5-million disbursement offered by the county because the money could be spent only on emergency payroll and purchasing commitments . &quot; The city is not in emergency mode with_respect_to payroll and purchasing , &quot; Colson said . &quot; If ( the county ) hadn ' t put any restrictions on it , we would have accepted the money to meet general operating expenses. &quot; Colson said city officials will re-evaluate their position on the disbursement after Christmas . The city has $ 169 million invested in the fund , 20 % of its total investment portfolio of $ 874 million . Santa Ana , which defaulted_on a $ 5.3-million debt service last week , will learn later this week if the county will release the $ 9.6 million the city needs to continue a massive jail construction project . &quot; If we get the money this week , we ' ll be fine , &quot; City_Manager David N . Ream said Monday . The city will be forced to halt the project if it cannot come_up with the debt service payment and the $ 4.5 million in contractor ' s fees that are_due this month . County ' s Cash Intake As creditors continued to pick through the financial wreckage this week , the county ' s advisers -- the Salomon Bros . brokerage_house -- revealed that the county ' s investment portfolio will take_in only $ 598 million in cash from the $ 1.39 billion it raised in last week ' s initial sale of securities . The balance -- $ 792 million -- went_to pay down some of the loans still outstanding to the fund from major brokerages . Salomon also said Monday that it had failed to count $ 390 million in loans in its initial valuation of the fund a week ago , when it estimated the total loan amount at $ 2.56 billion . But Salomon said that because the $ 390 million loan it missed was fully collateralized , the gross market_value of the securities in the fund -- listed last week as $ 7.96 billion -- also was undercounted by $ 390 million . The end result , the brokerage said , is a wash . The original $ 5.03 billion that Salomon estimated could be recovered for the fund by liquidating its securities still is accurate , the brokerage said . If that much is raised , the fund ' s investors will have lost 27 % of their investment . Salomon raised the additional $ 175 million for the fund Monday by selling a handful of securities . Negotiations are continuing between Salomon and the U.S._government agencies that issued the bulk of the more complicated &quot; derivative &quot; bonds owned by the fund . Salomon hopes to restructure those securities with the agencies rather than sell them on the open market , but officials on both sides say they aren ' t sure they can strike a deal before January .</TEXT>
