   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN SERBS SPURN U.N. ENVOY ' S PLEA ON BEHALF OF PEACE PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb leaders on Saturday rebuffed a top U.N. official ' s plea to accept an international peace plan . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said after meeting with U.N. envoy Thorvald Stoltenberg that maps calling_for Bosnian Serbs to settle for 49 % of the republic &quot; cannot be accepted. &quot; Bosnian Serbs currently hold 70 % of Bosnia . Stoltenberg met with Bosnian Serb leaders at their headquarters in Pale on Saturday after holding talks Friday in the capital of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic . Officials at U.N. headquarters in New York characterized Stoltenberg ' s trip as an urgent mission to persuade Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace plan they repeatedly have rejected . Milosevic , widely regarded_as the instigator of Bosnia ' s war , is trying to force Bosnian Serbs to agree to a peace plan , hoping his efforts will lead to the lifting of international sanctions against Yugoslavia . Bosnia ' s Croats and the Muslim-led government have accepted the plan , which would give their federation 51 % of the country . The Bosnian war began in April , 1992 , when Serbs rebelled against a vote by Muslims and Croats , who together formed a majority in Bosnia , to secede from Yugoslavia . In other developments : * Explosions and machine-gun fire erupted Friday night around Sarajevo ' s Jewish cemetery , one of the most hotly contested fronts in the Bosnian capital . There was no clear indication of what started the fighting , and no word on casualties . Sarajevo ' s airport partially reopened Saturday , after both sides reassured the United Nations . Flights have been canceled for most of the past three weeks because of shooting at aircraft . * U.N. spokesman Maj . Rob Annink reported three more abortive efforts by Bosnian Serbs on Friday to remove heavy_weapons from U.N. collection points around Sarajevo . One such effort on Aug . 5 led to a NATO air strike . * Croatian President Franjo Tudjman warned the U.N. Security_Council in a letter that his country would not tolerate persistent attacks from rebel Serbs in Croatia , such_as the shelling of the Dubrovnik airport Thursday . A cease-fire agreement 2 1 / 2 years ago ended six months of war between Croatia and the republic ' s Serbs that killed 10 # 000 people , but efforts to negotiate a more comprehensive peace have stalled .</TEXT>
