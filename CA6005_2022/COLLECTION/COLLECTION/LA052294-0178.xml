   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : CARRY_ON , GUV ' NORS ; WORKING TITLE HAS LOTS OF COMEDY TITLES WORKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When it comes_to movies , one of the toughest exports is comedy . As a rule , humor doesn ' t transcend cultures well . But the London-based Working Title Films is determined to change that . Riding high on the box-office windfall of their romantic comedy &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral &quot; and what seems to be a growing American appetite for British movies , company co-chairmen Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner are banking on five more comedies . The secret , they say , lies_in films that either have American stars with a British sensibility , or English actors with a Hollywood twist -- while avoiding political and racial controversies , and emphasizing romance . Consider these : * An untitled European romantic spoof , with a screenplay spun by the mastermind of the &quot; Naked Gun &quot; movies , Pat Proft , who satirizes Merchant Ivory films . Production begins in August . * &quot; Paris Match , &quot; a $ 30-million romantic comedy , directed by Lawrence Kasdan and starring Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan , that starts shooting in September . * &quot; Mr. Bean , &quot; featuring a wacky British character played by Rowan Atkinson , the bumbling clergyman in &quot; Four Weddings. &quot; The $ 10-million project is set for a Christmas ' 95 release . * &quot; Loch Ness , &quot; a family adventure about the Scottish myth , scheduled for next year . * &quot; Moonlight and Valentino , &quot; written by Neil Simon ' s daughter Ellen , also for next year . &quot; I think these pictures will work because they ' ll strike_a_chord , not because we ' re in some sort of British fad phase right now , &quot; says Michael Kuhn , president of Polygram Filmed Entertainment , the parent of Working Title . &quot; There ' s been a saturation or overexposure of American comedy here with it on every TV channel you turn_to . People are just looking_for something fresh and different. &quot; And at least one American , Russell Schwartz , is going_to make the best of it . His marketing campaign for the Merchant Ivory spoof : &quot; I ' ll put that film in every theater that every Merchant Ivory film has ever been in. &quot; And where producer Merchant famously heralds the premieres of each of his movies with a feast , &quot; we ' ll have a food fight ! &quot; *</TEXT>
