   <HEADLINE> PUBLIC SAFETY ; U.S. PANEL ' S MOVE TO UPGRADE A-PLANT SECURITY DRAWS FIRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two hundred feet farther and Pennsylvania might still be glowing . At the Three Mile Island nuclear_power plant last year , a discharged mental patient barreled his station_wagon into a turbine building , stopping just 200 feet short of ramming a vital area of the facility and possibly triggering a deadly release of radiation . Security was so light that he was able to race past a guard post , break_through a chain-link fence and crash through the building ' s steel door . He drove 60 feet into the building , got_out of his car and evaded guards at the plant near Harrisburg , Pa. , for four hours . By contrast , security_forces at most nuclear_weapons factories are equipped with SWAT teams , helicopters and enough military hardware to stop a tank , not to mention a station_wagon . After resisting 10 years of lobbying efforts by safety groups , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is starting to notice the difference . Charged with anticipating terrorist threats to the nation ' s high-energy nuclear facilities , the commission last month adopted a policy that would require most power_plants to stiffen protections against truck bombs . Since the World Trade Center bombing last year , an army of safety groups has intensified efforts to persuade the commission to issue more stringent rules demanding that plant owners build stronger fences or beef_up security_forces . Recent U.S.-North Korean tensions also have spotlighted the apparent weakness of reactor security , because most South_Korean power_plants are U.S.-designed. But as the commission stood poised to announce the new policy , many plant owners sought to loosen the proposed requirements , hoping to cut costs . Safety advocates say no amount of penny-pinching would offset the huge monetary and human costs of nuclear sabotage . &quot; We ' d like to see nuclear_power plants better protected , &quot; said Paul Leventhal , president of the Nuclear Control Institute , a nonprofit group that has sought tougher security for reactors since 1984 . Some terrorism experts say bombers are more likely to strike at power_plants because they are &quot; soft targets. &quot; Commission rules say plants should be ready for attacks by small bands of well-armed soldiers . Nonetheless , they allow the facilities to keep only five-member security_forces on a shift . The new policy , which is classified , requires reactor operators to prepare_for an attack by armed terrorists who might use a truck to break_through outer defenses or detonate a bomb outside the plant ' s perimeter . But the new rules are less stringent than safety advocates had hoped . Fences built under the commission ' s existing specifications are so weak that they can only detect breaches , not block would-be intruders , said Bruce Hoffman , a nuclear terrorism specialist at the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp . Yet some plant operators wonder whether the new policy is needed . Phillip Clark , president of GPU Nuclear Corp. , which runs the Three Mile Island facility , said that &quot; the radioactive safety of the public does not require a new rule and increased security. &quot; Upgrades in plant security should be left to reactor operators , said Clark , who erected stronger fences at the Three Mile Island site after the intruder crashed through the barriers . Analysts accuse the reactor operators of caring more for their wallets than for public safety . &quot; The Three Mile Island incident alone suggests that instead of bean-counting up and down over the cost of a fence , they should be thinking in terms of deterring the next adversary , &quot; Hoffman said . The next adversary may_not even attack on U.S. soil . Intelligence experts are concerned about the vulnerability of civil research_centers and nuclear_reactors in Russia , Belarus , Kazakhstan and Ukraine -- from which terrorists could extract plutonium and weapons-grade fuel . FBI terrorism experts say the threat of nuclear sabotage at U.S. plants is very low . &quot; We are talking_about a minuscule threat , &quot; Hoffman acknowledged . &quot; But in the nuclear domain , one is one too many. &quot;</TEXT>
