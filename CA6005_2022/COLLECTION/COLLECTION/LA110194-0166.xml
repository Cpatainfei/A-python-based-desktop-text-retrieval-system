   <HEADLINE> YOUR BODY : BODY WATCH ; FASTER RELIEF FROM A PRESSING PROBLEM ; THE SIGNS ARE UNMISTAKABLE -- IT ' S ANOTHER URINARY TRACT INFECTION . NOW FOR THE GOOD NEWS : THERE ARE BETTER REMEDIES NOWADAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first clue might be an annoying need to visit the bathroom way too often . that ' s followed by a burning sensation while urinating and sometimes pain in the pelvic area . Urinary tract infections most often affect women , but men aren ' t immune , especially in later life when enlargement of the prostate_gland can increase the likelihood . But lately there ' s good news for sufferers . Treatment of urinary_tract_infections -- which can involve the bladder , kidneys or the urine-transporting tubes -- has become easier in recent years , thanks , in part , to new antibiotics and shorter courses of medication . * The Stats and the Source : Urinary tract infections , or UTIs , are nearly always bacterial . Women are more prone than men due partly to anatomy . A woman ' s urethra -- the tube through which urine is excreted from the bladder -- is shorter , making infection more likely . Infection can occur after intercourse , when bacteria normally found in the genital area can be pushed_up into the urinary_tract . UTIs are so common , some experts say , that most women can count_on having at least one at some point in their lives . Published figures estimate 10 % of women have had UTIs , says Dr. Eila Skinner , USC assistant_professor of urology , but she suspects the percentage is actually much higher . &quot; And of those women who get one , 20 % will have recurring infections , &quot; she adds . Use of a diaphragm or IUD for contraception can be associated with UTIs , experts say . And what about the folklore that also links horseback_riding , bicycling , and wearing tight jeans and tight pantyhose to UTIs ? &quot; There might be some merit to the horseback_riding , &quot; says Dr. Barton Wachs , a urologist at Long_Beach Memorial Medical_Center and clinical instructor at Harbor / UCLA Medical_Center . As for the risk of the other behaviors , evidence is &quot; mostly anecdotal , &quot; he says . But if women notice a link , avoiding the attire or activity might help . &quot; But of course many people who do all these things never have an infection , &quot; he adds . * Home Remedies : At the first sign of infection , many women self-treat by drinking plenty of fluids , including cranberry_juice , hoping to flush out the bad bugs . It probably can ' t hurt in most cases , experts say . But anyone who ' s had a type of kidney_stone composed of calcium oxalate -- the most common kind -- should avoid the cranberry_juice remedy , Wachs says , because the juice contains oxalic_acid . ( But others , including a spokeswoman for a cranberry_juice manufacturer , counter that there ' s not enough oxalic_acid to do harm. ) * Professional Help : Self-care helps about half of women , Skinner says . If symptoms don ' t improve in two or three days , see a doctor , she advises . Seek medical help , too , if the urine contains blood . Men or children with suspected UTIs should always see a physician because their infections are likely to be associated with potentially serious underlying problems . * Diagnosis &amp; Treatment : A physician may order a culture of the urine , which can pinpoint the bacteria involved and determine whether kidney_stones have formed . &quot; Certain organisms suggest kidney_stones or other abnormalities , &quot; Skinner says . Oral antibiotics are the usual treatment . Commonly prescribed are such medicines as ampicillin or nitrofurantoin . Quinolones , a newer choice , have become a common treatment , but they are being overused , says Dr. Philip Hanno , professor and chairman of the department of urology at Temple University School_of_Medicine . Quinolones -- such_as ciprofloxacin ( Cipro ) -- should be reserved for &quot; complicated cases , &quot; he believes . &quot; But they ' re a lifesaver on a Friday afternoon when you can ' t get a culture ( analyzed ) , &quot; Wachs counters . * New Versus Old Treatments : Not too many years ago , standard antibiotic treatment for UTIs took seven to 10 days , Hanno says . Now , patients are placed on &quot; shorter and shorter &quot; courses , with two-day regimens common . Sometimes the medicine is even taken_in a single dose , thus increasing patient compliance . &quot; Within 24 hours after starting an antibiotic you should feel better , &quot; Wachs says . Following antibiotic treatment , however , women are more prone to yeast infections , Wachs says . So he recommends an over-the-counter anti-fungal remedy ( such_as Monistat 7 or Gyne-Lotrimin ) or a prescription anti-fungal medicine . If a woman has repeated UTIs , a physician might recommend daily use of antibiotics for three to six months to build resistance . Or , some women are given an emergency supply of antibiotics to use when they notice symptoms or to take before and after intercourse . Women who get more_than four UTIs in a year should see a urologist , Wachs says . * An Ounce of Prevention : Drinking plenty of fluids and voiding after intercourse can help flush away bacteria . * On the Horizon : Under development is a vaccine to protect against UTIs . While it is not expected to be_on the market in the immediate future , Hanno says , it does promise eventual relief to women prone to infections . How the Urinary System Works Also known as the urinary_tract , the system , which filters and disposes of waste from the blood , consist_of the kidneys , ureters , bladder and the urethra . The Kidneys This is where urine is formed to help carry_out waste from the blood . Located next to the aorta , more_than two pints of blood passess through the kidneys every minute . Cross_section Cortex , Medulla , Calyces , Pelvis Collecting System After going_through the filtration system , or medulla , most of the water and other substances are reabsorbed into the blood . The remaining concentrated urine are collected by the calyces and run_through the pelvis . From there , the urine goes_to the ureter . The Ureters The tubes that carry the urine from the kidney to the bladder . The Bladder This is where up_to a pint of urine is stored . Composition of Urine * 96 % water * 2 % urea ( the main waste_product ) * 1 % sodium_chloride ( salt ) * Source : AMA Encyclopedia of Medicine</TEXT>
