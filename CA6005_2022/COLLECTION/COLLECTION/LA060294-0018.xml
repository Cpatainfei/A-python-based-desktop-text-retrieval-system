   <HEADLINE> WINE : A WINE NAMED SUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re thinking about starting a winery , it would seem that the least worrisome thing would be picking the name for your product . At least , that ' s what Lou Preston thought . A jovial grape grower in the north end of Sonoma County ' s Dry Creek Valley , Preston has always liked cute names on the wines of his Preston Vineyards and Winery . Some years ago , he made a blend of Petite Sirah and Syrah that he called Syrah Sirah . Recently he made a delightful red_wine blended from Rhone grapes . He called the wine Faux Castel -- a take-off on the famous Rhone winery Beaucastel . The label was identical to all other Preston labels ; there was no effort to redesign the label to look_like the one used at Beaucastel . Still , the potential for conflict was obvious , especially since the Perrin family , owners of Beaucastel , own vineyard land in California -- in the Paso Robles area of San Luis Obispo Country -- and have planted vines , intending to make an American version of their Rhone_wine . Not being particularly litigious , Preston wrote the Perrins , seeking to resolve any conflict before it reached the legal stage . Kevin Hamel , the winemaker at Preston , says the winery sent copies of the labels to the Perrins . &quot; They ' ve been friends of ours for a number of years , and we wanted to make_sure they knew what our intentions were , &quot; says Hamel . &quot; The Perrins admitted that it was very entertaining , but they said they preferred we not use the name again , &quot; said Hamel . &quot; We respectfully said , ' OK , fair enough , we will change it. ' &quot; So with the current 1992 vintage of the wine , the only word on the label is Faux ; the Castel is gone . Hamel says that in addition to false , faux means imaginary . The wine is neither . It is a superb blend of 23 % Carignane , 23 % Grenache , 16 % Mourvedre , 37 % Syrah and 1 % Zinfandel . At $ 9 it ' s a delightful wine , loaded with berry-ish fruit and just enough tannin to parry with rich foods . This name game ended quietly . No legal salvos were fired . Other arguments have been settled far more bloodily . * In one of the most egregious examples , the E &amp; J Gallo Winery of Modesto , the world ' s largest , sued the Italian trade group that represents Chianti growers -- claiming the phrase &quot; gallo nero &quot; the Italians had used since 1922 infringed on a name the U . S . winery had made famous , even though the Gallo Nero had been in business 11 years longer than Gallo . After years of legal battles , the Italian group found legal costs excessive and capitulated . It agreed not to use its own language ( gallo nero means black rooster in Italian ) on its labels . In a final bit of irony , Gallo continues to make a wine called Chianti . * But the Gallo Nero people shouldn ' t take that dispute personally . The Gallo brothers , Ernest and his late brother Julio , sued their younger brother , Joseph , to prevent him from marketing cheese under the Gallo name . The older brothers prevailed . Today the name on Joe Gallo ' s cheeses says it comes from Joseph Farms . * In one of the most celebrated name-conflict cases , Stag ' s Leap Wine_Cellars , owned by Warren Winiarski , and Stags ' Leap Winery , owned by Carl Doumani ( note the different placement of the apostrophes in the winery names ) , waged a costly legal battle , each claiming first use of the name . Eventually a settlement permitted both men the use of the name . * Some years ago the small Napa Valley-based Quail Ridge , claiming first use , prevailed on Quail Run of Washington state to change its name . The name is now Covey Run . * Lou Preston of Dry Creek ' s Preston Vineyards and Winery and S . W . ( Bill ) Preston of Preston Wine_Cellars started their wineries a month apart in 1976 . Each claims first use of the Preston name and wants the other to change . The only result has been a lot of paperwork . * Tiny Pommeraie Winery in Sonoma County had been in business a decade when suddenly it was sued by the giant Champagne house Pommery and Greno . The suit claimed consumers might confuse a tiny , two-person winery that makes only Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon with a French Champagne maker . Pommeraie , unable to defend itself in court because of excessive legal bills and knowing it couldn ' t market wine under a new name , closed its doors . * Mitch Cosentino , owner of small Napa Valley producer Cosentino Winery , is known for creative names on his wines , such_as &quot; The Poet &quot; and &quot; The Novelist. &quot; In 1988 , he made a top-of-the-line red_wine that he called Cos , after the first part of his last_name . The Bordeaux_wine property Chateau Cos d ' Estournel sued , arguing that consumers often call their wine &quot; Cos &quot; for short . Cosentino eventually was forced to change the name of the wine to M . Cos . * The owners of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild , the first growth chateau of Bordeaux , demanded that Barefoot Cellars of Sonoma County refrain_from using the phrase &quot; the Chateau La Feet of wine &quot; on its label . Mike Houlihan , wondering how consumers could confuse an $ 80 Bordeaux with his $ 5 table_wine , avoided litigation by agreeing to change the phrase to &quot; The Chateau La Foot . . . . &quot; * Fetzer Vineyards of Mendocino County , like many other wineries , used the phrase &quot; barrel select &quot; on some of its upscale products . Unlike the others , Fetzer sought and obtained a U . S . trademark on the phrase . Then some genius in the firm that owns Fetzer -- Brown Foreman of Louisville -- sent_out letters to other wineries that use the term , threatening legal_action if they didn ' t cease and desist ( the way lawyers like to talk ) . One winery owner bristled and said she ' d change the phrase to &quot; barrels elect &quot; and dared Fetzer to sue . But it never came_to that . After a_few months , cooler heads prevailed and Fetzer backed_off its demands . * When Fred Fisher of Sonoma County ' s Fisher Vineyards decided to call his best wine &quot; Coach Insignia , &quot; he raised the eyebrows of Joseph Phelps , whose winery ' s famed &quot; Insignia &quot; wine was the first great California proprietary red_wine . Phelps , fearing a problem , called Fisher . The two men met and Phelps learned that Fisher intended to release only super-premium wine under the Coach Insignia name . No legal_action ever was taken . Obviously , some wines were just made to go_with appellate torts . Wine of the Week 1993 Christophe Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc ( $ 6.50 ) -- Complex herbal notes , melon-y fruit and a light but well-defined taste that doesn ' t rely_on oak for its flavor . Along with the great 1993 Canyon Road Sauvignon Blanc , this excellent wine is one of the best value Sauvignon Blancs on the market . You ' ll probably find it priced lower than $ 5 . The Christophe brand is owned by Grands Vins Jean Claude Boisset , the largest negociant in Burgundy . Project director Ginny Mills of Sonoma County recently switched_over to Napa Valley wine for its varietal line . The wine was purchased from other top producers and blended to accent fruit . The price reflects the fact that the program has no winery , no tasting room , and doesn ' t advertise . &quot; Christophe ' s entire public relations program is in each bottle , &quot; said Mills .</TEXT>
