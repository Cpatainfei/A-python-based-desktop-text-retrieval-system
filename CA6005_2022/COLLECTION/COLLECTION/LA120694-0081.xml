   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OXNARD ; MAN , 21 , ARRESTED IN PHONE ' CLONE ' CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Oxnard police have arrested a 21-year-old man on suspicion of arranging to have cellular_phones &quot; cloned &quot; so calls could be billed to other customers . Kip Cyrus Sweeney allegedly offered customers at Crossover Cellular in Oxnard the option of having their phones activated legitimately or reprogrammed with someone else ' s electronic serial number , said Oxnard Police Detective Len Newcomb . Sweeney was taken into custody about 5 p.m. Thursday after agreeing to illegally clone a cellular_phone for two Secret_Service agents working undercover , Newcomb said . &quot; He was pretty blatant about that , &quot; Newcomb said . &quot; He just said to our operators , ' You want it set_up legitimately or do you want me to have it chipped for you ? ' &quot; As payment for the cloning , Sweeney agreed to accept three pagers that the agents told him were stolen , Newcomb said . Sweeney ' s arrest was the second in two weeks in the county in connection with cellular_phone fraud . On Nov . 29 , sheriff ' s detectives raided the homes of two accused drug dealers . Along with methamphetamine and guns , they seized equipment used for reprogramming cellular-phone chips . Sweeney , who lives_in Oxnard , was booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of attempting to receive stolen property and phone fraud , both felonies . He was released Friday on a promise to appear in court . Newcomb said the actual reprogramming appears to have been done_by another Ventura County resident , but he would not say if further arrests are expected . At the time of Sweeney ' s arrest , police seized one cloned phone in the small office in the Union Bank_Building . Police do not yet know how many phones Sweeney arranged to have modified or the amount of calls placed illegally . JULIE FIELDS</TEXT>
