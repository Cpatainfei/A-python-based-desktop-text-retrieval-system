   <HEADLINE> BLOOD MATCHES SIMPSON TYPE , POLICE SOURCES SAY ; INQUIRY : NEW ATTORNEY WILL SEEK SEPARATE FORENSIC TESTS . SIMPSON ATTENDS VIEWING OF HIS EX-WIFE AT O.C. MORTUARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The blood_type of samples recovered at the scene of a brutal double slaying match that of O.J. Simpson ' s blood , a potentially important piece of evidence in the investigation of the killings of his ex-wife and a man she knew , Los Angeles police sources said Wednesday . Simpson ' s blood_type is different from those of the two victims , Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman , a source said . Although even rare blood_types are shared by many people , any discovery of Simpson ' s blood_type at the murder scene could lend credence to the suggestion that he was there , sources said . A more exact test to determine whether the DNA in the blood sample matches Simpson ' s has not been concluded , sources added . Simpson ' s lead attorney , newly hired lawyer Robert L . Shapiro , was unavailable for comment late Wednesday on the blood_test results . Shapiro earlier said he will seek a second autopsy of the two victims and private forensic tests . Howard Weitzman , who represented Simpson until Wednesday and continues to serve as an adviser to his legal team , said he was unaware of any test results concluding that Simpson ' s blood_type matched samples recovered from the scene . On Wednesday , Simpson slipped out of his Brentwood home for several hours to attend a private viewing of his ex-wife at a Laguna Hills mortuary , along with her family members who live_in the Monarch Bay section of Dana Point . Although sources have said Simpson is the main suspect in the investigation , the Los Angeles Police_Department has declined to confirm those reports , and Simpson has not been arrested or charged with any crime . New details emerged Wednesday about a matching pair of gloves whose existence Weitzman has vehemently denied . According to police sources , investigators found two work gloves , one at the scene of the crime and the other outside Simpson ' s Brentwood mansion . Both had blood on them , but tests for the blood on the gloves have not been completed , sources said . According to one source , the glove at Simpson ' s home was found outside a side_entrance near a trail of drippings that have been determined to be blood . &quot; That would be inconsistent with what I was told , &quot; said Weitzman , who has said that a police official assured him that there was no second glove found at Simpson ' s home . &quot; Beyond that , I have no comment. &quot; * Sources said Goldman ' s wounds indicated that he fought fiercely when attacked , and they said Simpson was scratched and cut when police interviewed him several hours after the crime . Weitzman and others familiar_with the investigation said the former athlete spent much of the day at his Brentwood mansion , grieving over the death of his ex-wife , surrounded by members of his family and in consultation with his legal team . As authorities sifted through the evidence in the case , Simpson switched lawyers , hiring Shapiro to head his legal team . He said that Simpson is under treatment for depression . &quot; He is deeply upset , &quot; said Shapiro , one of Los Angeles ' best-known lawyers . &quot; He is under a doctor ' s care_for depression . . . . He is going_to be in seclusion with his family to grieve over the loss of the mother of his children. &quot; Weitzman -- who has vigorously defended Simpson ' s innocence over the past three tumultuous days -- has given_up the lead role to Shapiro , a celebrated Century City lawyer whose clients have included Darryl Strawberry and Tina Sinatra . Explaining why he has stepped_down , Weitzman said in a statement : &quot; I have decided because of my personal_relationship with O.J. Simpson and my many other professional commitments I can no longer give O.J. the attention he both deserves and needs. &quot; Shapiro said he told Simpson to avoid watching television or reading newspapers and to instead focus_on his family . Two black limousines were seen leaving Simpson ' s Brentwood mansion Wednesday afternoon , and a_few hours later , he was filmed by a television_station as he drove_away from O ' Connor Laguna Hills Mortuary , where his former wife ' s body was being prepared_for burial . &quot; We had a viewing . . . to send my sister off . We all went and paid our respects , &quot; said Denise Brown , Nicole ' s older sister . &quot; And . . . yes , O.J. was there . But what ' s the big deal ? It ' s his ex-wife . My God , it ' s somebody we all love . We just want to let her go_in peace. &quot; A source close to Simpson said he visited his children , who are staying_at their grandparents ' house in Orange County , before returning home . A private funeral is scheduled for today in Brentwood . In a brief statement released after he took_over the case , Shapiro said Simpson was at his Brentwood home waiting for a limousine when Nicole Simpson , 35 , and Goldman , 25 , were killed Sunday night . Simpson traveled_to the airport late that night and then caught a &quot; red-eye &quot; flight for Chicago . A source said he was the only passenger to travel in the first-class section of the American Airlines flight from Los Angeles International Airport . Weitzman had previously said he believed that Simpson was in the limousine or at the airport when the killings occurred . So far , an exact time of death has not been released by authorities , although Weitzman has said he was told that it was about 11 p.m. Sunday -- supporting his contention that Simpson could not have committed the crime and still gotten_to the airport in time to catch his flight . Sources have said that police believe that Simpson would have had enough time to make the trip , suggesting that they believe that the time of death may have been somewhat earlier . Los Angeles police discovered the bodies after midnight and called Simpson at his Chicago hotel Monday morning to tell him that his ex-wife had been found dead in Brentwood . Simpson returned to Los Angeles that morning and was questioned by police the same day . Among Shapiro ' s first moves after taking_over for Weitzman was to solicit the services of a criminologist and a pathologist , whom he would not identify except to say that each is a nationally recognized professional . They will review the findings of the police and perform a second autopsy on the two victims , he said . * The experts would only have standing in the case if Simpson were to face charges , as witnesses are not entitled to bring_in their own experts to review evidence . Nevertheless , Shapiro said he had no information indicating that Simpson ' s arrest is imminent . Shapiro met with police Wednesday , saying afterward that he has pledged Simpson ' s full cooperation during the investigation . &quot; I have introduced myself to the members of the Los Angeles Police_Department , &quot; Shapiro said , &quot; and to offer our complete cooperation with them in their investigation to solve this crime. &quot; Sources said investigators spent Wednesday continuing to work their case , and they were said to be just a_few days away from turning it over to the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office . According to sources , investigators were continuing to interview witnesses -- including a therapist who said she counseled Nicole Simpson on two occasions . Simpson ' s ex-wife said during the sessions that he was stalking her , the therapist has said . As they conduct their investigation , police were said to be painstakingly reviewing their case , eager to avoid a situation in which they arrest a suspect for the double slaying and then have the case sent_back by prosecutors for more work . Once police make an arrest , they have 48 hours to present a case to the district_attorney ' s office for prosecution . In some cases , however , prosecutors may elect to present the_matter to a grand_jury and ask_for an indictment . If that procedure were followed in this case , it could delay any arrest by several days , but it also would preclude the need for a preliminary hearing in which evidence is presented in a public courtroom . * Times staff writers Dianne Klein and Eric Malnic and correspondent Matthew Mosk contributed to this story .</TEXT>
