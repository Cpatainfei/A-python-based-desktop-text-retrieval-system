   <HEADLINE> 4.5 TEMBLOR A FAMILIAR WAKE-UP CALL ; SEISMOLOGY : EARLY- MORNING AFTERSHOCK NEAR SAN FERNANDO IS LARGEST IN TWO MONTHS . NO MAJOR DAMAGE IS REPORTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Residents of Los Angeles and Ventura counties received a jarring but short-lived wake-up call Wednesday morning when the largest aftershock to the Northridge earthquake in two months rattled the Los Angeles Basin , but caused only minor damage . While the 4.5-magnitude shaker was only powerful enough to break a_few dishes and rattle some nerves , for many it provided a grim reminder of the destructive pre-dawn quake of Jan . 17 . &quot; I was like ' Here we go again , ' &quot; said Shawn Rucker , 24 , of San Fernando . At his house , picture_frames and plants fell to the floor and several glasses broke_in his kitchen . &quot; It was like a train going_through my house , &quot; he said . &quot; I expected it to go_on like the Jan . 17 earthquake , then it just stopped. &quot; The 5:56 a.m. temblor , which shook for as long as 15 seconds in parts of the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood , was centered three miles northeast of San Fernando . It was felt throughout the basin and as far west as Camarillo in Ventura County . Caltech seismologists said it was even felt on Catalina Island . Throughout the day , smaller aftershocks struck the same area . &quot; Probably the more emotional people were just starting to relax , &quot; said Kate Hutton at Caltech . &quot; This was a pretty good feeler . It ' s the nature of nature , and we can ' t do much about it. &quot; As jarring as the aftershock was , scientists say it was not only normal , it was overdue . U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucile M . Jones said a computer analysis predicted we would likely get four aftershocks over magnitude 4 between March 20 -- the date of the last significant aftershock -- and Wednesday ' s temblor . Instead , there was only this one , and it was a relatively small one at that . &quot; This was a little less than would have been expected , &quot; said Jones . &quot; It is not very typical at all. &quot; Residents a_few miles from the epicenter were particularly shaken . At the Tahitian Mobile_Home Park in Sylmar , where 64 trailers burned after the Northridge quake , the jolt brought renewed fear . &quot; I was thinking that if it went_on any longer , I would throw my body over my sons , and then it stopped , &quot; said Susan Rezvani , 37 , standing with her two boys , Neema , 12 , and Naveed , 4 , outside a friend ' s trailer . &quot; I thought_about not letting them go_to school today , but I ended_up sending them. &quot; Otto Hofmann , 60 , has lived_in a motor_home outside his Sylmar house since it was red-tagged after the Northridge quake . During Wednesday ' s temblor , he said the rubber wheels on the trailer made_it bounce up and down like a ball . &quot; I thought the epicenter was here , &quot; said Hofmann . &quot; Everybody started yelling and screaming , ' My God , not again ! ' &quot; Luckily , the only casualty in his makeshift home was a fax machine that fell from a shelf , Hofmann said . In other areas , the damage was also minor . Cracks in the walls of homes not yet repaired from the January quake widened , chandeliers swung , dishes broke and frightened children hopped in bed with parents who couldn ' t get_back to sleep anyway . There were no reported electrical , water or phone_service disruptions and no freeway closures due_to the aftershock , officials said . Of the 8 # 000 aftershocks since the Jan . 17 quake , only about 400 could be felt by residents . Seven of the aftershocks were between magnitudes 5 and 6 ; approximately 40 were between 4 and 5 . More_than 300 were between 3 and 4 . The March 20 aftershock , which measured magnitude 5.3 and was centered near Panorama City , sparked two fires in the Valley but caused no injuries . Times staff writer Kenneth Reich contributed to this story . Shock After Shock Although the number of daily aftershocks from the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake has dropped substantially , the earth continues to move . According to seismologists at Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena , Wednesday ' s early morning 4.5 shaker was the strongest since a magnitude 5.3 temblor on March 20 . &quot; They come_in spurts , &quot; said USGS seismologist Thomas Heaton after last week ' s 3.6 temblor . &quot; Any random phenomena comes_in clusters. &quot; Recent aftershocks include : Date : 5-25 Magnitude : 2.8 Time : 2:41 p.m. Epicenter : 1 mile south-southwest of San Fernando * Date : 5-25 Magnitude : 4.5 Time : 5:56 a.m. Epicenter : 3 miles east-northeast of San Fernando * Date : 5-24 Magnitude : 3.1 Time : 1:56 p.m. Epicenter : 2 miles southwest of San Fernando * Date : 5-22 Magnitude : 2.8 Time : 8:34 a.m. Epicenter : 1 mile north of Chatsworth * Date : 5-18 Magnitude : 3.6 Time : 11:12 p.m. Epicenter : 2 miles north of San Fernando * Date : 5-18 Magnitude : 2.8 Time : 8:02 p.m. Epicenter : 2 miles north of Canoga Park * Date : 5-18 Magnitude : 3.0 Time : 11:54 a.m. Epicenter : 4 miles north-northwest of Northridge * Date : 5-16 Magnitude : 3.7 Time : 1:40 a.m. Epicenter : 6 miles south-southwest of Valencia * Date : 5-15 Magnitude : 2.9 Time : 10:45 a.m. Epicenter : 3 miles east of Northridge * Date : 5-9 Magnitude : 3.2 Time : 4:45 p.m. Epicenter : 3 miles north-northwest of San Fernando Sources : Caltech , U.S. Geological Survey ; Research : DAVID BRADY / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
