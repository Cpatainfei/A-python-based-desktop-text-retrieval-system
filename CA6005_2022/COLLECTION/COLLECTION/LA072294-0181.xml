   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; ' THREE TENORS , ' THE VIDEO , COMING SOON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is Tenormania over ? No way . Tenors Luciano Pavarotti , Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo crooning arias and pop tunes at Dodger Stadium last Saturday night was breathlessly billed as the concert of the century . The most heavily hyped concert of the century was more like it . Anyway , it ' s about to become one of the most heavily hyped music videos of the century . The tape of the concert is coming_out Aug . 30 on A * Vision Entertainment , at $ 30 . Hands_down , it ' ll be the music video of the year . The video is part of a multimedia blitz that ' s being launched that day , including the release of the CD ( $ 20 ) and the laser disc ( $ 40 ) . There will also be a collector ' s package -- not yet priced -- featuring an audiotape , a video tape and a program . The TV broadcast of the concert merely whetted appetites for the home video . Even those who taped it might want to buy the video , which offers first-rate sound -- crucial to the appreciation of such a concert . The promotional campaign , explained A * Vision ' s president Stuart Hersch , will include TV ads , billboards and posters . Consumers will also be able to order the recordings by phone from TV ads , the usual marketing strategy when targeting an audience that ' s somewhat older and doesn ' t frequent the typical music video outlets . &quot; We expect it to sell in the hundreds of thousands , &quot; Hersch said . Usually , if a classical_music tape sells 20 # 000 copies , video companies are satisfied . At $ 30 , it ' s a bit expensive for a music video , which rarely cost more_than $ 20 . Defending the price , Hersch said : &quot; The usual hourlong music video is $ 19.98. This tape is much longer ( two to two and a half hours ) , so it should cost more. &quot; To make the tape even more attractive , there ' s an extra . &quot; It will include one song that was not on the TV_show , &quot; Hersch said . &quot; We wanted to save something for the video that was exclusive. &quot; This is the second tape of a performance by the three singers . The first , &quot; Carreras , Domingo and Pavarotti : The Three Tenors in Concert , &quot; came_out in 1990 , and has sold more_than 2 million copies worldwide -- the biggest-selling classical_music video ever . The first was released by PolyGram , which lost out_to A * Vision for the rights to release this one . But this is just Phase 1 of Tenormania . Phase 2 is scheduled for next year when , Hersch said , A * Vision will release a making-of tape , featuring behind-the-scenes footage and , possibly , leftovers from the upcoming video . Videobits Paramount ' s &quot; Naked Gun 33 1 / 3 : The Final Insult , &quot; a comedy featuring O . J . Simpson , is_due out Sept . 21 . It sounds likes Paramount is trying to have it on the market in time to take_advantage of the media furor over Simpson ' s trial , which may be scheduled this fall . But a Paramount spokeswoman said the movie , which debuted in theaters in March , was always slated to come_out then -- the usual six months after theatrical release . In the sales market , one of the fall ' s biggest titles will be FoxVideo ' s &quot; Sleepless in Seattle , &quot; starring Tom Hanks -- who ' s red-hot after winning an Oscar and starring in the huge hit &quot; Forrest Gump. &quot; &quot; Sleepless &quot; is_due out Sept . 6 , repriced to $ 20 . FoxVideo is also offering the 1957 movie &quot; An Affair to Remember &quot; at a new price , $ 10 . Featured in &quot; Sleepless , &quot; &quot; Affair , &quot; starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr , was a hit all_over again . Special_Interest If you ' re considering a home theater and don ' t know where to start , there are many helpful hints -- both on what to buy and how to assemble it -- on &quot; Consumer Guide to Home Theater. &quot; Put_out by Dolby Laboratories , ( 800 ) 241-4115 , it ' s somewhat of an ad for the company . Still , this 48-minute video ( $ 20 ) is an outstanding guide . . . . One of the more informative videos on the market , particularly for those over 40 , is &quot; How to Stay Healthy , Live Longer and Cut Your Medical Costs. &quot; This 90-minute video is_full of useful financial and medical advice . For $ 30 from In the Black Video , ( 212 ) 864-0318 . What ' s New On Video &quot; On Deadly Ground &quot; ( Warner ) . Steven Seagal directed and stars in this eco-thriller , about the hero ' s efforts to foil an oil_tycoon ( Michael Caine ) building a refinery in Alaska that would pollute the environment . Admirable message , but the movie is preachy and amateurishly directed . Vastly inferior to his last movie , the exciting &quot; Under Siege , &quot; but OK entertainment for hard-core Seagal fans . &quot; Searching for Bobby Fischer &quot; ( Paramount ) . The trials of a 7-year-old chess prodigy , played by Max Pomeranc . His parents ( Joe Mantegna and Joan Allen ) have differing views about how he should use his skill and his tutors ( Ben Kingsley and Laurence Fishburne ) school him in vastly different approaches . Though you ' ll spot elements of the &quot; Karate Kid &quot; series and a bit of &quot; Rocky &quot; too , it ' s basically a well-made , absorbing family drama . Writer-director Steve Zaillian also wrote the script for &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; &quot; Car 54 , Where Are You ? &quot; ( Orion ) . The ' 50s TV comedy series about lovable , buffoonish New York cops was goofy fun but the movie , with David Johansen and John McGinley as Toody and Muldoon , has a silly plot about protecting a witness and is_full of dumb jokes and bad performances . Fans of the series may dislike this movie , which is geared to those with high tolerance for lowbrow humor . Rosie O ' Donnell , Fran Drescher and Daniel Baldwin co-star . &quot; My Father the Hero &quot; ( Touchstone ) . Leering comedy about a bumbling dad ( Gerard Depardieu ) , vacationing in the Bahamas with his bratty , teen-age daughter ( Katherine Heigl ) . To impress a prospective boyfriend , she fabricates a tale that has everyone believing they ' re really lovers . Mostly unfunny and sometimes tasteless , with murky undercurrents of incest and the Lolita syndrome muddying the humor . FILMS ON VIDEO Recent films coming_out on video : Miramax ' s &quot; The Crow , &quot; starring Brandon Lee , and Columbia TriStar ' s &quot; Threesome , &quot; starring Lara Flynn Boyle , on Sept . 14 ; Miramax ' s &quot; Farewell My Concubine &quot; on Sept . 21 .
