   <HEADLINE> LETTER HINTS AT MOTIVES IN CULT MURDER-SUICIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first solid clue to the motives behind the murder-suicide of 52 members of an extremist sect in Switzerland and Canada arrived Thursday in a letter to a cult expert . In it the group said it was &quot; leaving this Earth to find a new dimension of truth and absolution , far from the hypocrisies of this world. &quot; In Canada , police in Quebec province said they found two more charred bodies in the rubble of a building that once served as headquarters for the group , known as the Order of the Solar Temple . In all , 48 bodies have been discovered in two Swiss villages and four in the Canadian town of Morin Heights . The typewritten letter , included with three other documents in a large yellow envelope , was sent to Jean-Francois Mayer , a prominent specialist in Lausanne , Switzerland , who has studied the apocalyptic group and knew its founder , Luc Jouret . The envelope was postmarked from Geneva , 30 miles away , but the date was illegible . It was signed &quot; Monsieur D . Part , &quot; an apparent reference_to the_French word for &quot; depart , &quot; and listed a nonexistent return_address in Zurich . Mayer said he was convinced that the letter and the documents , titled &quot; Transit to the Future , &quot; &quot; The Rose Cross &quot; and &quot; In the Love of Justice , &quot; were from Jouret ' s group . The letter complained that Jouret and his sect had been &quot; persecuted &quot; in Canada . &quot; We have freed ourselves from the burden that day after day had become unbearable , &quot; the letter said . It added that the group was leaving &quot; in_order to achieve the seeds of our future generation. &quot; &quot; I had asked myself until this morning whether this was suicide or murder , &quot; Mayer said Thursday . &quot; Unfortunately , what I read here confirms the hypothesis of collective suicide. &quot; The Swiss authorities , who were continuing their efforts to identify the victims , did not doubt the authenticity of the letter . But they still suspected that murder , as well as suicide , played a role in the grisly demise of the_Swiss , French and Canadian cult members who died in a farmhouse and two Alpine chalets -- all outfitted with sophisticated incendiary devices that were triggered by either a timing mechanism or a telephone_call . The fire in Canada was set by the same type of device , authorities said . The four bodies there were badly charred and none has yet been identified . Officials in the_Swiss village of Granges-sur-Salvan , where 25 of the victims were found in the embers of two burned chalets , revealed that at least four of the bodies had been children , one as young as 5 or 6 . Bernard Gieger , the police_chief of the Valais canton , or state , which includes this village , told a news_conference Thursday that he saw the case &quot; more as a collective murder. &quot; &quot; I formally exclude collective suicide decided by all -- that idea is pure cinema , &quot; he said . &quot; You can ' t expect children to want to kill themselves. &quot; In addition , Gieger said police found packed suitcases belonging_to the victims in an apartment rented by the group in the village . Most of the dead here appeared to have been drugged or poisoned , Gieger said , and fewer than half suffered burns severe enough to have caused death . Meanwhile , in Cheiry , Switzerland , where 23 other cult members died of gunshots and suffocation , investigating prosecutor Andre Piller said Thursday that preliminary autopsy results indicate that &quot; a powerful product , not yet identified , was administered by either injection &quot; or intravenous drip . Piller also backed_away from his earlier assertion that the farmhouse victims , 19 of whom were found lying_in a circle in an underground chapel , had died in a ritual , collective suicide . &quot; Certain elements make us stay with this theory , &quot; he said , &quot; but others make us think_of an execution . We cannot exclude one or the other. &quot; The prosecutor also said three rifles were recovered at the scene , though none was used in the killings . Fifty-two bullet casings were also found . Of the 23 victims , 20 , including a 10-year-old boy , had been shot at least once in the head or chest . About half of the victims also had black plastic garbage bags cinched over their heads . Meanwhile , the international search continued for Jouret , the 46-year-old homeopathic doctor who authorities and cult experts say led the sect and who may or may_not have died with his followers . Jouret , who received his medical degree in Belgium and held Canadian citizenship , practiced medicine in France , just across the border from Geneva , until 1987 , when he moved to Canada . Swiss authorities said Thursday that the Canadian government had asked them to investigate Jouret some months ago , but they had found no reason to arrest him . Cult experts in Europe said they thought Jouret , if he followed his own apocalyptic teachings , probably died along with his followers in Switzerland or in Canada . &quot; It would be logical that he died with his disciples , &quot; said Jean Vernette , a Roman_Catholic priest in Montauban , France , and author of 30 books on sects . &quot; But , then again , maybe not . He is human and , faced with death , he may_not have been able to go that far. &quot; No one yet knows if Jouret is among the victims of the murder-suicide . Police said they would continue searching for him at least until all_the bodies had been identified . Interpol and Swiss police also said they were searching for two people already questioned in connection with the fires . An official described them as possible &quot; witnesses , &quot; but he declined to say if authorities believe that the two were present at any of the killings . Jouret had been known to cult experts for more_than a decade , though he had recently disappeared from view . He was described by medical associates Thursday as a charming man and a competent doctor , though some said he often frightened lecture audiences with his talk_of apocalypse . But leaders of associations here that have helped families extricate people from his sect knew Jouret as a rather more dangerous man who directed his attention to wealthy recruits from as far away as the Caribbean_island of Martinique . Some sold all their possessions to join the sect . &quot; He chased families with money -- doctors , dentists , civil_servants , &quot; said Lucien Zecler , president of Martinique ' s Assn . for the Defense of Family and Individuals . In Granges-sur-Salvan , where no resident can remember a single murder in the once-peaceful town ' s history , investigators ended their search of a third burned-out chalet without finding more bodies Thursday . As cow bells rang in the hillside meadow , arson investigator Jean-Claude Martin stood among the blackened remains of the house and marveled at the skill of the person who set the fires in the three chalets here . &quot; It ' s difficult to talk_of logic here , &quot; Martin said . &quot; But the person who did this really knew about fire . It was a complete system . This person was very intelligent. &quot; The blaze at the chalet , which was the first to catch_fire on this mountainside , had been triggered manually , probably by a match , Martin said . Five cars , apparently belonging_to sect members , had been parked outside . Inside , police found charred literature , videotapes and other office material in a strongbox and an unscathed scrap of one of Jouret ' s checkbooks . A small , wooden chapel next door did not catch_fire . On Thursday , it was still ringed with curtains of red silk , and an altar was inscribed with one of the sect ' s names , &quot; The Cross and Rose. &quot; Unlike in Cheiry , where residents believed that the five permanent residents of the farmhouse were engaged in macrobiotic plant experiments , the residents of Granges-sur-Salvan , population 100 , had long been suspicious of the comings and goings at Jouret ' s chalets . Although few residents remember ever seeing Jouret , they recall that many wealthy people , driving expensive cars and dressed nicely , frequented the chalets . The lights in the houses often burned until well past midnight , and several residents suspected that the people were involved in drug dealing . &quot; I said to my wife , this is not normal , all these elegantly dressed women in our town , &quot; said Leo Buset , 70 , a neighbor . The retired insurance investigator added : &quot; Everyone in town thought it was a meeting_place for drugs or maybe a sex ring. &quot; Times staff writer Stanley Meisler in Montreal contributed to this story .</TEXT>
