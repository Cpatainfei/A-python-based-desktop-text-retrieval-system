   <HEADLINE> INGLEWOOD PREPARES TO OVERHAUL SCHOOLS ; EDUCATION : TACKLING PROBLEMS ONE AT A TIME DOESN ' T WORK , SUPERINTENDENT SAYS . AN ENVISIONED TOP-TO-BOTTOM REWORKING WILL INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After four months as the head of the Inglewood Unified School District , McKinley Nash has found that tinkering with school staffing , district personnel and curriculum will not save the city ' s school_system . It needs to be reworked from top to bottom , he says . Nash ' s conclusion is no surprise to many who have watched the school_system founder in recent years : Test scores at the middle and high_schools are at the bottom of the South Bay -- even though the city ' s elementary_schools typically perform well . The district is struggling to comply with state bilingual education requirements , and its budget problems induced the state to appoint a fiscal administrator to the district . Many of the best students leave the district to attend high_school in other cities , Nash has said . * What is a surprise is that the City_Council and city_manager , the Chamber_of_Commerce , religious_leaders , and parent and teacher groups all have agreed to join with the school_board to overhaul the school_system . At a meeting to which every segment of Inglewood society was invited , Nash and the school_board unveiled plans to begin a strategic plan for the system . The plan would examine every aspect of the district and develop goals for the future . In an unusual act of governmental unity , the City_Council already has voted to provide $ 40 # 000 to pay_for the school project , and the board has called its first meeting with strategy planner William J . Cook of the Cambridge Group of Alabama . &quot; No longer can we sit on the sidelines and point a finger at others for not educating our children , &quot; said board President Lois Hill Hale . &quot; We have to rejuvenate an outdated education system . We on the board_of_education know we ' re not providing the quality of education we should be for our children. &quot; Rather than haphazardly attempting to raise test scores or remedy budget problems , the district first needs to agree on what its mission should be , Nash said . Then it needs to define its specific goals and how it plans to accomplish them . * To that end , Nash has asked the board to commit to an intense , yearlong effort to develop a plan for the district . &quot; A strategic plan is really the only way we ' re going to be able to get all_the junk out of this system and start over , &quot; Nash said in an interview . &quot; We ' ve got_to look_at every single aspect of this system and decide whether it ' s functioning in_line with what our goals and values are . But first we need to define those goals and values. &quot; Strategic planning , which gained popularity among corporations 20 years ago , has become a trend in education . The Cambridge Group has helped more_than 300 school districts nationwide develop strategic plans , and in California the group has worked with the Glendale , Beverly Hills and Berkeley school districts , among others . The plan requires districts to include representatives from every group affected by education on a team of 20 to 30 people and to draft the district ' s beliefs , missions , a variety of analyses , objectives and strategies . The draft plan is reviewed with the public , and action teams then are formed to implement the strategies . The difference between the planning that the district has done_in the past and a strategic plan is that the entire community will be included and decisions must be unanimous . Recently the board invited about 200 people to meet Cook , who will help Inglewood develop a plan . &quot; I ' m not a consultant and I don ' t come equipped with answers , &quot; Cook said to about 180 people . &quot; If we begin this process , you ' ll be the ones to develop those . But I do have one saying : ' When the horse dies , it ' s a really good time to dismount. ' &quot; The audience laughed , but Cook said he was preparing them to look unflinchingly at the school_system and be willing to do more_than minor repairs . * Strategic planning also requires a high degree of community unity . All decisions reached by the planning committee must be unanimous , and committees should include representatives from virtually every segment of society affected by Inglewood education . &quot; We have to rejuvenate an outdated education system , &quot; Hill Hale said . &quot; But we cannot do_it without help. &quot; Administrators at other school districts that have done strategic plans give the effort high marks . &quot; It is a process that helps a district to focus all_of the energies and resources in an agreed-upon direction , &quot; said LaVoneia Steele , superintendent of the Berkeley Unified School_System when it began its strategic plan in 1991 . * Cook asks each district that does a strategic plan to identify its core beliefs . Berkeley ' s included : That societies prosper to the extent that they care_for their children . Each person has a right to make his or her own choice and is responsible_for his or her own action . Everyone has an unlimited capacity for learning . A truly educated person cannot be racist . Excellence is worth whatever it takes . &quot; All this translates into better-educated students , &quot; Steele said . &quot; Our objectives are to have 100 % of our students graduate . . . to see that all graduates are prepared_for post-secondary education or employment of their choice and that all students achieve their own educational goals. &quot; Beverly Hills also developed a list of beliefs : That a person ' s rights to thoughts and ideas are inviolate . Society requires standards of right and wrong . Every person needs love . Family is the primary influence on each person ' s development . Literacy is vital to individual empowerment . Diversity of all kinds enriches . Administrators in Beverly Hills already know that their school_system is excellent and are not seeking to correct major problems , said Bert Pearlman , assistant superintendent for educational services . The district , however , decided that a strategic plan is necessary if it is to carry that excellence into the rapidly changing , technological world of the 21st Century . &quot; One thing about Beverly Hills : We are both a very forward-thinking and very conservative district , &quot; Pearlman said . &quot; We looked as this carefully before doing_it . &quot; It sounds abstract in the beginning , but I think this is a process that has potential for bringing action home and making ideas real. &quot;</TEXT>
