   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; THE OUTER BANKS ; QUIRKY COMIC FINDS A BACHELOR PAD ON PBS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> PBS does have a wild and crazy side . Though best known for its high-brow documentaries , British dramatic series , nature shows and arts programming , PBS did introduce American audiences to the zany British comedy series &quot; Monty Python ' s Flying Circus. &quot; PBS ' latest find : Steven Banks , a lanky baby_boomer with a quirky sense_of_humor . A man prone to breaking_into imitations of Rex Harrison , Bob Dylan and Katharine Hepburn . &quot; At Public Television , we believe there ' s no arena of the human experience which isn ' t appropriate or right , &quot; says Jennifer Lawson , executive_vice_president of national programming . &quot; Humor has been a part of Public Television . We want to be open_to innovative and creative talents from this country. &quot; PBS thinks it ' s found one such &quot; innovative and creative talent &quot; in &quot; The Steven Banks Show , &quot; premiering Sunday on KCET . Banks plays a 30ish bachelor named Steven Banks who lives_in a horribly cluttered apartment where he constantly procrastinates . A fan of the Beatles , Bob Dylan and the Monkees , Steven loves to sing and play the piano , guitar and drums . And , of course , there ' s the previously mentioned imitating of celebrity icons . Teresa Parente and Michael Kostroff play six recurring characters ; Monkee Peter Tork , Bill Mummy ( &quot; Lost in Space &quot; ) , Louis Nye and Penn &amp; Teller are among the guests . &quot; The Steven Banks Show &quot; is based on Banks ' popular Los Angeles and San Francisco one-man show , &quot; Steven Banks ' Home Entertainment Center. &quot; In 1989 , Showtime aired &quot; Entertainment_Center , &quot; which was taped live_in San Francisco . &quot; We think Steven is an unusual talent , &quot; Lawson says . &quot; He is a performance artist in many ways. &quot; Because his show is_on PBS , Banks says , TV_stations have the option to air the series at different days and times . &quot; It ' s on after ' Masterpiece Theatre ' in Los Angeles , &quot; explains Banks , who comes_across as a friendly and funny guy over lunch at an Italian restaurant in Glendale . &quot; In Salt_Lake_City , it ' s on 12:30 Saturday nights . Orlando , Florida , is not running it . The state of Iowa is not running it . But that ' s OK. &quot; The show is Banks ' second attempt to translate his sense_of_humor to series TV . In the late ' 80s , several producers courted him . &quot; Norman Lear wanted to do something . Brandon Tartikoff , Grant Tinker , Allan Burns , ABC . We ended_up at Disney. &quot; ( Tartikoff is now executive producer of the PBS series. ) Banks , now 38 , shot a pilot at Disney , but it never sold . &quot; It didn ' t work_out , &quot; he says . &quot; I learned a lot . Some things worked and some things didn ' t. &quot; The PBS series deals with subjects that interest Banks . In the first episode , &quot; Rock ' n ' Roll Auction , &quot; Steven buys John Lennon ' s guitar at an auction only to discover he bought Julian Lennon ' s guitar case . &quot; I collect stuff . I love rock ' n ' roll. &quot; He didn ' t want his series to be a carbon_copy of &quot; Home Entertainment Center. &quot; &quot; It ' s sort of based on me and what I ' m really like , and a lot of it ' s totally made_up . The neat thing was to go_into different areas and not just make_it about procrastinating all_the time . &quot; There are a lot of things within the show that are very different , just having two other actors play all_the other parts . There ' s so_much music and it ' s live music , which I think is very obvious . I said ( to the producers ) , ' This has got_to sound like a guy who is in his apartment playing his guitar and singing . It can ' t sound at all clean. ' &quot; The Glendale native , who plays drums , piano and guitar , became interested in acting in 1962 when he saw Robert Preston in the movie version of the musical &quot; The Music Man. &quot; &quot; I learned the whole record and pantomimed it , &quot; he recalls with a warm smile . Banks went_to Los Angeles City College for one year as a film major and attended the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College in Florida in 1975 . &quot; Then I did a lot of Equity Waiver dives around L.A. I also toured junior_high and high_school assemblies . that ' s a whole other story . That will be a miniseries . I was sort of a ' 70s and ' 80s version of Victor Borge . I played a lot of different instruments. &quot; &quot; Steven Banks ' Home Entertainment_Center &quot; was an instant hit when it premiered eight years ago at Hollywood ' s 40-plus seat Chamber Theatre . &quot; Entertainment_Center , &quot; he says , was actually built around the set . &quot; They had a set from a show that had opened and closed_in , like , two weeks . It was a very realistic-type of Sam Shepard kitchen set. &quot; Though &quot; Entertainment_Center &quot; was taped in front of a live audience , the series ' 13 episodes were shown to audiences after they were completed . &quot; We couldn ' t do_it ( in front of an audience ) because it took so_long to shoot each show because we had to do complete makeup and costume changes with the two other actors . It takes a long_time to make them good and realistic . We were shooting two shows a week . I still can ' t believe we did it. &quot; At the conclusion of each episode , viewers will be offered the opportunity to purchase the video of that show . Fans also will be able to buy the CD or cassette of the original songs Banks performs on the series . &quot; I ' m more excited about that than having a TV_show named after me , &quot; Banks says with a smile . &quot; The Steven Banks Show &quot; premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on KCET ; it also airs Mondays at 9 on KPBS .</TEXT>
