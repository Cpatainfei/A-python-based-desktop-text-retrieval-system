   <HEADLINE> NIGERIAN LABOR FEDERATION CALLS STRIKE IN SUPPORT OF DEMOCRACY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The military government faced more pressure Saturday after the country ' s biggest labor federation called a general strike to back a pro-democracy campaign . Workers in the oil_industry , Nigeria ' s economic lifeblood , launched the campaign four weeks ago with a crippling strike to demand the release of detained politician Moshood K . O . Abiola and a return to democratic rule . A general strike called by the Nigerian Labor Congress ( NLC ) to begin Wednesday could bring Nigeria to a halt if it receives significant backing from the 3.5 million members of its 41 affiliate unions . The NLC said Friday night that its efforts to persuade the military government to free Abiola and other political_detainees had failed . &quot; Consequently , in_view of our conviction that an industrial action has become inevitable , Congress calls_on all its affiliates , state councils of congress and Nigerian workers to , as from Wednesday , August 3 , 1994 , embark_on a sit-at-home protest action and await further directives , &quot; it said in a communique . The strike by the oil workers ' unions to try to force the release of Abiola , undeclared winner of army-organized presidential elections in 1993 , has disrupted domestic fuel supplies , transportation and normal business . It has also begun to threaten vital exports . Shell Petroleum Development Co . of Nigeria said last week that it was losing 38 % of normal production . Shell produces roughly half of Nigeria ' s 2 million barrels a day of oil , 1.6 million of which is exported to provide Nigeria with its main source of income . Nigeria ' s worst crisis for decades deepened after Abiola , a wealthy southern businessman , was arrested last month and charged with treason for declaring himself president . There is rising concern that the crisis could degenerate into ethnic chaos as southern resentment grows at what political_leaders there see as the determination of the northern ruling elite to retain power . * RELATED STORY : A28</TEXT>
