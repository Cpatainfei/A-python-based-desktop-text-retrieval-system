   <HEADLINE> BATTERED BOLSA TAKES YET ANOTHER POUNDING ; MEXICO : CENTRAL_BANK ' S RATE HIKE DELIVERS NEW BLOW TO LATIN_AMERICA ' S LARGEST STOCK_MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s been a tough year for the Mexican stock_market , and it ' s getting_worse . Battered by the Chiapas rebellion , the kidnaping of a prominent banker and the assassination of the country ' s leading presidential candidate , the market ' s Bolsa index has plunged more_than 30 % in dollar terms since Jan . 1 , more_than any major international exchange . On Wednesday , the impact of another factor_in the market ' s slide was evident . The Bolsa fell 5.2 % , or 107.44 points , to 1 # 957.33 after the Mexican central_bank announced that the interest_rate on Mexico ' s bellwether 28-day Cetes , or treasury_bill , soared 3.42 percentage_points to 18 % at the weekly auction , the highest level since November , 1992 , and up from 8.8 % just two months ago . The central_bank has been lifting its treasury_bill rates since late February to stem a massive flight of jittery investors from Mexico , an exodus spurred in part by the March 23 assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio . Even analysts who see the higher rates as a short-term phenomenon said Wednesday that they fear Mexico is running a big risk in raising rates so high . If prolonged , the high rates could reignite inflation , peso instability and the financial turmoil that laid_waste_to Mexico ' s economy in the 1980s . Others such_as Nora Lustig , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , say the chances of renewed hyper-inflation are low because of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s fiscal reforms . She insisted , as did others , that the spike upward is_due as much to the recent rise in U.S. interest_rates as internal events in Mexico . The U.S. interest_rate hikes have also fueled a slide in the U.S. markets . In any case , uncertainty and turmoil are bound to prevail in the Mexican market -- Latin_America ' s largest -- until the presidential election in August and the new leader lays_out the nation ' s course for the next six years , said Jonathan Heath , chief economist at Macro Asesoria Economica , a Mexico City-based think_tank . Until then , foreign investors will remain fearful of further trauma , such_as a recurrence of peso devaluations that historically have coincided with Mexican elections , Heath said . Investors are also trying to make_sense of a murky political situation marked by Colosio ' s assassination and the peasant uprising in Chiapas . &quot; Fundamentally , there is no reason for what is happening , this deterioration in the stock_market . So what we may have is an unfortunate case of a pessimistic self-fulfilling prophecy , &quot; said Abel Beltran del Rio , president of Cie mex-Wefa , a think_tank in Philadelphia that follows the Mexican economy . By making the treasury investments more attractive , the Mexican government hopes to compensate foreign investors for their fears about Mexico ' s future . &quot; The Banco de Mexico ( central_bank ) is just giving foreign investors a better option , &quot; a Mexico_City securities analyst said . Beltran del Rio estimated the outflow of foreign capital at $ 6 billion since the Colosio assassination . One foreign investor who has already headed for the border is Gilman C . Gunn , senior manager of Keystone Fund for the Americas . Gunn reduced his fund ' s Mexico holdings to 5 % from as much as 35 % at the end of 1993 . A continued drain of foreign capital would hurt Mexico because outside funds are critical to its internal growth . An exodus of foreign capital would also mean a huge sell-off of pesos . Part of Salinas ' economic strategy has been to keep the peso within a certain range of the dollar to ensure foreign investors of stability . * DOWNWARD SPIRAL : Charting the Bolsa ' s precipitous decline .
