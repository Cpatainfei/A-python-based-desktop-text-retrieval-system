   <HEADLINE> CAMPAIGN ' 94 : ISSUES AND ANSWERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two candidates are running in the Nov . 8 election to represent the 70th Assembly District . They are Democrat Jim Toledano of Costa Mesa and Republican Marilyn C . Brewer of Newport Beach . Here ' s how the candidates stand on four issues . &quot; Three-Strikes &quot; Crime Law Toledano : &quot; The ' three-strikes ' law is more political showboating about crime . It wastes prison space on nonviolent felons , limits the amount of prison time given to violent first-time felons , and requires billions of tax dollars we do not have . Real reform means allowing courts to sentence first_offenders according to the seriousness and violence of their crimes ; long-term imprisonment of violent felons ; adequate parole supervision , not unsupervised release ; elimination of expensive multiple court hearings ; permanent hospitalization of sex offenders , not the prison revolving door ; and an end to our failed and appallingly expensive ' war on drugs , ' which drives_up the price of addictive drugs , the major cause of violent and property crimes today . Real reform is crime prevention , which is far cheaper than reacting to crime . Quality public education , leading to better jobs and community involvement , will prevent crime ; clever slogans and billions more tax dollars spent after crime has been committed will not. &quot; Brewer : &quot; I support California ' s ' three-strikes ' law . I also support ' one-strike ' for rapists . But while these reforms will keep hardened criminals off the streets , we also must look_to our neighborhood community groups , schools and churches to ensure that our youth develop a strong sense of right and wrong . And if they cannot get the message at_home , I support expanded use of ' boot camps ' that teach discipline , responsibility and job skills to troubled youth . Despite what the ACLU might say , I believe that tough intervention early on is the most compassionate way to deal with crime. &quot; Proposition 187 , to Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants Toledano : &quot; Whatever the cost may be to California from illegal immigrants , this initiative is badly written and will be tied_up in the courts and not accomplish any legitimate goals . I reject the racist assumption that illegal immigrants can be distinguished by sight from those here legally . I oppose putting thousands of children out of school and on the streets to commit crimes . I oppose requiring legal residents to carry Soviet-style identification cards . I oppose refusing treatment to potential carriers of epidemic disease because of their status . I oppose turning teachers and health-care workers into police . I support negotiating with the Clinton_Administration for reimbursement of the cost of illegal immigrants , and I wonder why Republican governors never asked Reagan and Bush to pay these costs. &quot; Brewer : &quot; I support SOS . And while the day after the election might find SOS in the courts , I think that process will bring_about an important dialogue within the federal_government as_to how our nation deals with illegal immigration . California can ' t shoulder the financial or social burden of this kind of influx . I believe , too , that we need to revisit the idea of automatic birth citizenship for a child of non-resident aliens . California ' s financial welcome_mat is too worn to even fund its own citizens ' needs. &quot; Single-Payer Health Initiative Toledano : &quot; I favor a system of universal basic health_care to supplement the present system . Whether health services are provided by a public or private entity , or a combination , is of little importance so_long as those services are provided efficiently and fully , and so_long as health-care decisions are made_for medical reasons , not financial considerations . There are serious problems inherent in enacting major legislation by initiative , and this initiative is not perfect , but today the special_interests and partisan politics have stalemated legislative reform . If this initiative passes , I will work to make_it better . If it does not , I will work for a legislative solution. &quot; Brewer : &quot; Single-payer will be the final nail in the coffin for California ' s economy . It ' s economic suicide to adopt a costly employer mandate if California is alone in the proposal ' s enactment . With such a drastic increase in taxes ( some believe that it will increase our taxes by $ 40 billion per year ) , any business that may have wanted to move or expand here will quickly be_on the phone to Nevada or North Carolina . I will be_active in my opposition to the initiative and will only support health_care reform that protects small businesses and jobs , provides tort reform , and preserves medical choices. &quot; Future Uses For El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station Toledano : &quot; I oppose bringing the present airport-related noise , pollution and traffic problems which plague one part of Orange County to another . There is no room in urbanized Orange County for any major airport facility . El Toro is in the wrong place for a major commercial airport , and to bring the present facility to acceptable standards will be as expensive as building an airport from scratch . I will work with the federal_government to find a site for a regional international airport which will replace inadequate and unsafe airports here and in San Diego . Meanwhile , if El Toro does shut_down , we must work together to put 21 # 000 new jobs , and more , in a 21st-Century industrial facility to be built_on that site. &quot; Brewer : &quot; Anyone who gives a quick ' yes ' or ' no ' on a commercial airport at El Toro is doing so without all_the facts at_hand . We don ' t even know if a commercial airport is physically or economically feasible at the site . We haven ' t even discussed the alternatives to an airport that might make a lot more economic sense . To answer all our questions , we don ' t need an initiative -- instead , we need to let the existing planning process run its course . Only then should any public official take a solid stand_for or against an airport at El Toro. &quot; * Source : Individual candidates ; Researched by ERIC BAILEY / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
