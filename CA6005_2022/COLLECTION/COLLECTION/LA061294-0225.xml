   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; TEMPLE CITY ' S ANGELES OUTSTANDING IN HIS FIELD ; OFFICIATING : FORTY-YEAR-OLD CIVIL ENGINEER IS THE LONE AMERICAN CHOSEN AMONG THE TOURNAMENT ' S 48 REFEREES AND LINESMEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No matter how the United States does_in the World Cup , there is at least one American assured of being around on the field for the latter stages of the tournament . Arturo Angeles is a 40-year-old civil_engineer from Temple City who is the only U.S. referee among the 48 referees and linesmen selected to officiate the 52 World Cup matches . For Angeles , who was born in Mexico_City and works for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , it is an honor many believe is well-deserved . He did not go_far as a player , appearing as a goalkeeper for USC , where he earned his engineering degree , and for a club team , Nacional , in the local Abraham_Lincoln Soccer League . As a referee , however , he has gone all_the way to the top . Angeles began refereeing games in 1973 , gradually working his way up through the youth , high_school and college ranks in Southern California until he had earned a reputation as an honest official who knew the rules and applied them fairly . In 1990 , after the World Cup in Italy , he was one of 80 referees from around the world who were placed on a list by FIFA , world soccer ' s governing body , and monitored regularly in top-class competition until last August . The list was pared to 30 and then , after a rigorous series of physical and written tests in Dallas last March , to the 24 referees who will be in_charge during World Cup ' 94 . For a referee , except for being selected to officiate the World Cup_final , it is the highest honor attainable . &quot; I ' m very , very happy ( about being chosen ) , &quot; Angeles said . &quot; that ' s every referee ' s dream . I feel a great responsibility . I need to work hard and train hard to be ready . I ' m very excited about it. &quot; Living_in a country where soccer is not as appreciated as elsewhere -- and is therefore not as well covered by the media -- Angeles has gone_out of his way to make_sure he keeps_up on the international game . &quot; I read La Opinion and I buy newspapers from Mexico , &quot; he said . &quot; And then , of course , I have a satellite dish . The only reason I bought_it was so I can see soccer games . I also get videotapes from friends ( overseas ) . &quot; Ask Angeles when he was awarded his FIFA badge , enabling him to referee any international game in the world , and he can tell you the exact date . &quot; I got_it_on Jan . 1 , 1988 , &quot; he said without hesitation . Since then , Angeles has traveled widely and officiated some significant matches , obviously catching the eye of FIFA with his performances . For instance , he was chosen to go_to Saudi_Arabia to referee at the 1989 World Under-20 championship . In the 1992 Olympic Games at Barcelona , he was the referee for the South Korea-Morocco match , as well as the prestigious Spain-Qatar game in front of a sellout crowd at Luis Casanova Stadium in Valencia . Spain won , 2-0 , and went_on to win the gold medal . In the latter game , Angeles handed_out seven yellow cards and ejected one Qatari player . No doubt his strict management of the match was noted by FIFA , which wants its referees to be in unquestioned control . Last summer was a busy one for Angeles . He was the man in the middle for the extraordinary Germany-Brazil match at U.S. Cup ' 93 in Washington . The Brazilians scored three goals in the first_half , and the Germans scored three in the second to tie it . Angeles then traveled_to Ecuador to officiate at the Copa America , or South_American championship . He was assigned only one game but it was a good one -- defending champion Argentina versus Bolivia , both World Cup ' 94 teams . &quot; It was a very rewarding experience ( refereeing in the Copa America ) , &quot; Angeles said , &quot; I learned a lot because the South_Americans are a little bit ahead of CONCACAF ( the North and Central_American and Caribbean region ) in terms of playing . They have more skills and technique and tricks and so forth. &quot; The chance to witness those skills up close and to control the play is what attracted Angeles to refereeing . &quot; I enjoy the challenge that you have to be right all_the time , &quot; he said , &quot; and the idea that you have to allow the players to play in such a way that you are there but yet they don ' t know you are there . that ' s difficult to do. &quot; In other words , to officiate in a manner that keeps the game flowing with as little interruption as possible and yet control with a firm hand . It ' s a delicate balance , one successfully achieved by only a_few top referees . Now , Arturo Angeles , World Cup referee , can count himself among that number .</TEXT>
