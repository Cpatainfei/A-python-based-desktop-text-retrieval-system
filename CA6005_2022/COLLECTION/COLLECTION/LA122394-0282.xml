   <HEADLINE> END TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FACES LEGAL TEST ; LABOR : ODDITY OF MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCY LAW ALLOWS SUSPENSION OF UNION PACT . EMPLOYEES LEADER HINTS COUNTY WILL BE CHALLENGED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In tearing_up collective_bargaining agreements with county employee groups Thursday , Orange County supervisors have set the stage for a possible legal test over their right to rescind pay raises and overturn seniority rules without the workers ' consent . The action was taken as part of an emergency effort to trim $ 40.2 million from the county budget by laying_off hundreds of workers beginning next month . Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection Dec . 6 , after disclosing that the investment pool run_by the county treasurer had lost $ 2.02 billion from risky bond investments . The board ' s unanimous decision Thursday , to rewrite seniority-based layoff policies that have been central to labor_agreements , is not going_to be accepted gracefully . John H . Sawyer , head of the Orange County Employees Assn. , which represents nearly 70 % of the county work_force , expressed outrage at the board ' s vote to allow department_heads to order layoffs based on productivity . He said his group would consider a court challenge . The move could &quot; violate the vested constitutional rights of county employees , &quot; and is &quot; predicated on a crude and ill-thought out application of Chapter 11 to a Chapter 9 proceeding , &quot; said John Sawyer Jr. , the employee group ' s attorney and son of its general_manager . &quot; Eliminating seniority seems to be designed to replace the merit_system with favoritism , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re going to be evaluating our legal options. &quot; Some bankruptcy law specialists say an oddity of municipal bankruptcy law allows the board action . In revoking sections of their collective_bargaining agreements with nearly 16 # 000 county employees , supervisors and the county ' s attorney cited a 1984 Supreme Court decision that says a company in bankruptcy can unilaterally abandon a collective_bargaining agreement if revisions can ' t be agreed upon . That case involved the notorious Continental Airlines bankruptcy in 1983 , when then-Chairman Frank Lorenzo took the airline into Chapter 11 bankruptcy specifically to break its union contracts during a protracted labor dispute . Acting at the behest of labor_unions outraged by the airline ' s bankruptcy , Congress in 1984 added a section to the federal bankruptcy code that specifically overrode the Supreme Court decision and prohibited employers from canceling labor_agreements . But while that new provision was incorporated into Chapter 11 , which regulates business reorganizations , Congress overlooked the little-used municipal bankruptcy rules of Chapter 9 . &quot; They probably would have added_to Chapter 9 if they had thought_about it , but they didn ' t , and so the law ( for government bankruptcies ) gets thrown_back &quot; to the 1984 Supreme Court ruling , said Daniel J . Bussel , a UCLA law professor bankruptcy specialist . Kenneth N . Klee , a Los Angeles attorney who was minority counsel to the House Judiciary Committee when Chapter 9 was revised and updated in 1975 , said there is a history of Congress exempting governments in bankruptcy from the same rules that bind private parties . &quot; In 1975 , when New York City was considering a Chapter 9 filing , it was considering abrogating its union contracts . and the unions were very opposed , &quot; Klee said . &quot; But when Chapter 9 was revised ( later that same year ) there were no special provisions put_in to protect unions and their collective_bargaining agreements. &quot; He said that because Chapter 9 doesn ' t include special protections for labor_agreements , a municipal bankruptcy is governed by an older provision of bankruptcy law that allows a debtor to void any contract if it determines that honoring it would be financially harmful . Klee , whose law_firm is advising Orange County in its bankruptcy , declined to comment on the appropriateness of the county ' s action Thursday . But Rich Reuben , a labor law specialist with the Newport Beach office of Pillsbury Madison &amp; Sutro , said the county seems to be supported by current law . &quot; Of course , there haven ' t been very many Chapter 9 filings , so there probably isn ' t anyone who really knows how a court would treat this , &quot; he said . &quot; This case is going_to set ground_rules for handling a host of issues in the Chapter 9 arena , and this issue of collective_bargaining definitely will be one of them. &quot; Labor attorneys and representatives were reluctant Thursday to lash_out at the county without seeing first just how far supervisors are willing to go_to slash personnel costs . &quot; We definitely have a different view of the law from that which the county apparently has , &quot; said Sawyer , the employees association general counsel . &quot; I can ' t say right now that it is likely that we will go_to court over this , but it is a possibility , &quot; he said . An attorney for the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees union in Washington declined comment Thursday until the union has time to review the county action . AFSCME ' s Southern California Council represents 1 # 300 workers in the Orange County Social_Services Department .</TEXT>
