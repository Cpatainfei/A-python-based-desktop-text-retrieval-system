   <HEADLINE> STUDY CASTS MOVIE POPCORN AS HEALTH VILLAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hamburgers , hot dogs -- and now popcorn . What ' s next on the killjoy list of yummies deemed dangerous to your health ? The popcorn served at most movie_theaters can help give you heart_disease , according to a study released Monday by the Center for Science in the Public Interest , a nonprofit consumer group . that ' s because artery-clogging coconut_oil high in saturated fat is used to pop roughly 70 % of the corn being pushed across refreshment counters , the study found . Even a small offering of popcorn without &quot; butter &quot; topping contains an entire day ' s recommended allowance of saturated fat , a major cause of heart_disease , according to the report . A medium-sized &quot; buttered &quot; popcorn at a typical theater contains &quot; more fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast , a Big Mac-with-fries lunch and a steak dinner with all_the trimmings combined , &quot; the study said . &quot; Theater popcorn ought to be the ' Snow White ' of snack_foods , but it ' s been turned_into ' Godzilla ' by being popped_in highly saturated coconut_oil , &quot; said center Executive_Director Michael Jacobson . Eleven heart-disease authorities joined the center in urging the heads of major theater chains to switch to air-popped corn , a lightly oiled-and-salted product that Jacobson said is delicious and contains 70 % less fat than corn popped_in coconut_oil . &quot; We ' ve known for 30 years that coconut_oil raises blood cholesterol more_than butterfat , beef_tallow , lard or any other fat or oil , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Havas of the University of Maryland Medical_School . &quot; It ' s unbelievable that theaters are still popping popcorn in this stuff when heart_disease is the No . 1 killer in the United States. &quot; The survey covered popcorn sold at United Artists , AMC , Cineplex Odeon , Loew ' s and other theaters in the San Francisco , Chicago and Washington areas . A laboratory in Texas did the nutritional analyses , which included calorie content . For example , at Cineplex Odeon theaters , a small serving ( about seven cups ) of popcorn cooked in coconut_oil and served without butter contains 398 calories , the study found . At AMC , a medium portion ( 11 cups ) with butter has 910 calories , and at United Artists , a large size ( about 16 cups ) with butter contains 1 # 221 calories . Theater industry executives said that , while they take the study seriously , their popcorn needs to be put_in perspective . &quot; The average person goes_to the movies only five or six times a year , and when they settle in with popcorn , candy and a soft_drink , they know they ' re not on the Pritikin regime -- they ' re relaxing , &quot; said Bill Kartozian , president of the National Assn . of Theatre Owners in North Hollywood . &quot; Also , &quot; he continued , &quot; a lot of people who go_to the show don ' t have butter added_to their popcorn , and a lot of people share , so the portions referred to ( by the study ) should be divided by some number. &quot; A spokesman for Cineplex Odeon told the Associated Press that popcorn is &quot; not a health issue , it ' s a small indulgence. &quot; He said that coconut_oil provides the taste and aroma craved by customers . &quot; Most people ask us why they can ' t get their home popcorn to taste as_good_as theater popcorn . The answer is the coconut_oil , &quot; said Howard Lichtman , executive_vice_president of marketing for the Toronto-based chain of 235 U.S. theaters . The study found that some theaters are showing signs of health consciousness . A multiplex theater in northern Virginia advertised that it was &quot; now popping with canola oil , low in saturated fats , no cholesterol. &quot; Trouble is , the study discovered , many theaters are using partially hydrogenated canola shortening , which contains four times the fat of canola oil . How Fat Content Varies Most movie_theaters make popcorn in coconut_oil ; a_few use canola shortening . Some stores sell air-popped popcorn . A look_at a typical &quot; small &quot; bag of popcorn ( seven cups ) prepared each way . * Popped_in coconut_oil , with butter-flavored topping : Total fat : 50 grams Saturated fat : 26 grams 632 calories * Popped_in coconut_oil , plain : Total fat : 27 grams Saturated fat : 19 grams 398 calories * Popped_in canola shortening , plain Total fat : 22 grams Saturated fat : 3 grams 361 calories * Commercial air-popped ( lightly sprayed with soybean_oil ) , plain : Total fat : 6 grams Saturated fat : 1 gram 210 calories * Guidelines : Food and Drug Administration guidelines recommend a maximum of 65 grams of fat , including 20 grams of saturated fat , in a 2 # 000-calorie diet .
