   <HEADLINE> U.S. FIRMS EAGER FOR LATIN TRADE DEAL ; SUMMIT : FINANCIAL SERVICES , TELECOMMUNICATIONS FIRMS AND ENERGY EQUIPMENT MAKERS SEE HUGE MARKETS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The agenda at this weekend ' s Summit of the Americas in Miami may accent lofty themes , but U.S. business_leaders reading between the lines see nothing but concrete opportunities coming_out of any move toward hemispheric free_trade . U.S. financial services , telecommunications companies and energy equipment manufacturers see huge markets opening_up in Latin_American countries just now emerging from protectionist regimes and registering rapid economic gains . A Western Hemispheric free_trade pact , the goal that each of the 34 nations is striving for , would only accelerate those gains . A few of the eager observers : AT &amp; T , which stands ready to wire Latin_America with fiber optic ; Salomon Bros. , which would like to prime the emerging economies ' pumps with capital ; Weyerhaeuser Co. , which wants to sell timber products , and Santa Fe Pacific , whose port facilities in Los Angeles and San Diego would exploit the extra ship traffic . &quot; What we want to see is the opening of markets generally throughout Latin_America , the deregulation of telecommunication services and the opportunity for companies like AT &amp; T to compete in those markets for both equipment and services , &quot; said Victor Pelson , chairman of AT &amp; T ' s global operations team based in New York . In fact , the summit ' s goal statement specifically targets telecommunications , capital markets and energy -- -- prerequisites for the infrastructure needed to better link member countries . In Brazil , for example , there are just seven telephones for every 100 residents -- compared with 56 per 100 in the United States . Closing such gaps demands high-cost , high-technology projects that are traditionally U.S. industry ' s bread_and_butter . &quot; The economies of Latin_America are in the take-off stage and there are some substantial projects in the planning_boards . We ' re talking_about billions of dollars of sales over next few years in telecom and natural_gas pipelines alone , &quot; said Jeffrey J . Schott , senior fellow at Institute for International Economics , a Washington , D.C. , think_tank . U.S. trade with Latin_America is gathering steam anyway . The United States turned a $ 2.8-billion trade surplus with the region over the year ended September , a surplus likely to grow rapidly over the next decade . Maintaining or improving that surplus with freer_trade is a high priority with the U.S. trade_deficit worldwide mushrooming to $ 108.5 billion last year . But there will be some bumps along the road to free_trade ' s level playing_field . Far-reaching reforms of Latin_American judicial_systems and stock_exchanges must be completed , for example , before U.S. investors are comfortable doing business there . Joyce Chang , emerging markets research_director at Salomon Bros. , said $ 66 billion in U.S. capital flowed into Latin_American stocks and bonds this year as investors were attracted by higher bond interest_rates and booming stock_markets . But that number would go much higher if certain Latin countries eliminated barriers to foreign investment , she said . Several countries are in dire need of stock_exchange reforms that set_up uniform rules for clearance and settlement so as_to &quot; guarantee that buyers get their stock and that sellers get their money , &quot; said an official with the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington , D.C. &quot; The courts have to be streamlined so if they have a dispute , it doesn ' t take_five or six years to resolve it. &quot; The leveling process will require significant U.S. concessions as well . Several Latin_American countries complain about U.S. trade_policy that protects domestic agricultural interests . They noted that the recently approved worldwide General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , a set of rules that govern international trade , is less stringent about freeing up markets for agriculture than for industrial products . Argentina , for example , wants the United States to stop subsidies for wheat farmers . Chile says it can ' t sell enough table grapes here . Colombia is mad about tariffs on its cut flowers , which once dominated the U.S. market . Brazil says it is prevented from exporting all_the orange_juice concentrate that it can produce . And Caribbean countries want to regain the preferential treatment for textiles they lost with last year ' s passage of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , the trade pact among Canada , Mexico and the United States . &quot; The U.S. subsidizes its wheat farmers and the Canada Wheat Board has an internal monopoly . So they can afford to go_on dumping in other markets such_as Brazil just like some Japanese electronics_companies . . . in the U.S. , &quot; said an official at the_Argentine Embassy in Washington . Lower priced American wheat sold in Brazil has severely damaged Argentine farmers for whom Brazil is the largest export market , complained the_Argentine spokesman , who asked not to be named . Gustavo de Grieff , director of Colombia ' s trade bureau in Los Angeles , said the United States protects Hawaiian banana growers with strict quotas that effectively block Colombia ' s access to U.S. markets . that ' s a damaging blow at a time when the European common_market is freezing_out Colombian and Ecuadorean banana farmers . But those issues are seen as relatively minor irritants in_relation_to the overall benefit of a hemispheric trade agreement . And the pressure is_on President Clinton to lead the summit toward that goal this weekend , despite the disappointing November elections and his recent failure to obtain &quot; fast track &quot; negotiating authority from Congress to expand NAFTA to other countries . At a minimum , Latin countries expect the United States to push_through the admission of Chile to NAFTA -- a demonstration that the United States is serious about free_trade beyond the pact it signed last year with Canada and Mexico . Today ' s widespread Latin support of free_trade &quot; is a phenomenon of the failures of previous policies and the debt crisis that ensued &quot; in the 1980s , said Schott of the Institute for International Economics . &quot; Countries have realized that protectionism is a costly policy. &quot;</TEXT>
