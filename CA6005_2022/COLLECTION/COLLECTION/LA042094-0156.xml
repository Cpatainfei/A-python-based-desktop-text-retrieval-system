   <HEADLINE> TOP-LEVEL UCI ADMINISTRATOR RESIGNS POST ; EDUCATION : M . ANNE SPENCE , VICE_CHANCELLOR OF ACADEMIC_PROGRAMS , WILL RESUME TEACHING AND RESEARCHING GENETICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Adding her name to a growing list of high-level administrators who have stepped_down from their posts at UC Irvine , Vice_Chancellor of Academic_Programs M . Anne Spence has announced she is resigning to resume teaching and research in genetics . Spence ' s position will be eliminated when she leaves her post May 1 , university officials said Tuesday . Spence was the first and will be the only vice_chancellor of academic_programs , a position created in early 1992 to help shape student affairs during lean budget years . However , two university task_forces studying cost-cutting measures recently recommended eliminating Spence ' s job and two other vice_chancellor posts -- a factor_in Spence ' s decision to resign , but not the overwhelming one , UCI officials said . &quot; The uncertainty about the position was taken into consideration , &quot; UCI spokeswoman Karen Newell Young said . &quot; She is eager to return to research full time , but it ' s also clear that both task_forces recommended that the position be abolished . &quot; The timing worked_out this way because of commitments Anne Spence was facing in terms of meeting grant proposal deadlines &quot; in genetics research , Young said . The university said Spence will resume teaching and research full time in the pediatrics department at the UCI College of Medicine . Spence , who did not return telephone_calls Tuesday , said in a prepared statement : &quot; My interest is and always has been in human genetics . I have enjoyed my sojourn into administration immensely , but I now have a number of exciting opportunities to expand my work with UCI ' s outstanding genetics research team. &quot; Among other things , Spence , an accomplished genetic counselor working in pediatrics , conducted research that looked_for the genetic origins of pre-adolescent schizophrenia , said UCI spokeswoman Linda Granell . * Young said that Chancellor Laurel L . Wilkening and Executive Vice_Chancellor Spencer Olin decided after Spence submitted her resignation that eliminating her position &quot; was the best decision at the time. &quot; Since Wilkening took_over the helm of UCI , three other high-level administrators have stepped_down , left for other jobs or were let_go . In March , engineering dean William A . Sirignano was ousted after a review . Dr. Walter L . Henry , vice_chancellor of health sciences and dean of the College of Medicine , resigned in December . And L . Dennis Smith left UCI and his executive vice_chancellor position to become president at University of Nebraska . When Spence leaves her post , one female vice_chancellor -- Kathleen Jones , in_charge of university advancement -- will remain . Granell said UCI still has several other women in top positions , including police_chief , head librarian and dean of biological_sciences . &quot; It ' s nice to have some women who are vice_chancellors -- and now there ' s going_to be one less , &quot; commented Paula L . Goldsmid , director of the Women ' s Resource Center_on campus . Granell downplayed the drain of top administrators . &quot; A few changes do not necessarily influence the day-to-day activities of this campus , &quot; she said . The departures come at a time when upper management is also dealing with budget strains . UCI ' s Academic Planning Council , during the next two months , will discuss cost-cutting proposals by two university task_forces and the campus community ' s response to them . Wilkening will announce which programs , departments and managers will be eliminated after June 1 . One of the task_forces suggested that the six current vice_chancellors be cut_to three . New positions would address education , administration and research and advancement . Granell said officials would have decided what to do about Spence ' s position during the review process . * &quot; There ' s $ 10 million to cut from the budget next year , &quot; Granell said . &quot; The timing wasn ' t ideal , but the chancellor and Spence Olin have determined it was a decision that probably would have been made. &quot; As vice_chancellor , Spence supervises academic_programs -- parts of the university that don ' t fall_into specific schools , such_as University_Extension , the library and interdisciplinary programs such_as Asian American studies . The creation of her vice_chancellor ' s position in 1992 brought opposition from several deans , said sources who did not want to be named . Some saw her as an additional , unnecessary manager meant to be &quot; politically correct &quot; and filling a job that was not well-defined . Granell declined to comment on Spence ' s standing among her peers but noted that she was responsible_for many internal faculty recruitment and retention matters . Those included promising Asian American students in 1993 that the university would hire four professors to teach Asian American studies . Others believe her position was set_up with too many demands . &quot; At the time the position was created , a number of women faculty were somewhat skeptical , &quot; said Judy Rosener , senior lecturer in the Graduate_School of Management . &quot; We felt it was going_to be given a lot of very difficult responsibilities , and a woman was definitely going_to be slotted , and it was set_up to fail. &quot; Rosener said Spence came_in with a professional and businesslike demeanor at &quot; a time of great chaos. &quot; An Oklahoma native , Spence earned a bachelor ' s degree in biology from Grinnell College in Iowa in 1966 and a Ph.D. in human genetics from the University of Hawaii . She joined UCLA in 1970 . Those Who Have Left These UC Irvine administrators have stepped_down since November : M .
