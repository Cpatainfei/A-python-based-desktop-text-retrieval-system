   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; EXPERTS SEE LEGAL PROBLEMS IN A MEDIA BAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Barring a television_station from covering the hottest trial in America might satisfy Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito ' s desire to control inaccurate media coverage of the O.J. Simpson case . But it most likely would run_afoul of the U.S. Constitution , legal_experts say . Ito might be_on firmer legal footing if he pulled the plug on courtroom television coverage altogether , they add -- but even that would not remedy the problem of leaks and inaccuracies that the judge has so bitterly denounced . &quot; If he wants to punish the media for leaks . . . he ' s not going_to do that by barring &quot; live television coverage , said Everette Dennis , executive_director of the Freedom Forum for Media Studies at Columbia University . &quot; The leaks are not coming_in open court. &quot; The judge suggested Friday that he might bar television_station KNBC-TV from the courthouse , or even remove all_the live television_cameras , following what he called a fabricated Channel 4 report that DNA tests had linked Nicole Brown Simpson ' s blood to socks seized from the former football star ' s bedroom . That report , Ito said , is an example of irresponsible , inaccurate coverage that is prejudicing the rights of both Simpson and the prosecutors attempting to convict him of murdering his ex-wife and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman . UC Berkeley constitutional law professor Robert Post said , &quot; To cut_off one station because the judge feels it to be inaccurate would be highly suspect. &quot; Indeed , there are three federal_court rulings which specifically prohibited public officials -- the mayor of Honolulu , a Louisiana sheriff and a Los Angeles federal prosecutor -- from barring out-of-favor reporters from their news_conferences . The argument against a judge banning one station would be even stronger &quot; because while there is not a constitutional right of access to a news_conference , there is a constitutional right of access to a court hearing under the 1st and 6th amendments , &quot; Post said . KNBC issued a terse statement Friday , saying only : &quot; We share Judge Ito ' s concern that the facts of this case be reported accurately , and we have reported accurately the information our sources have told us , just as we have reported accurately what happened in court today. &quot; And the station retained Rex Heinke , one of the city ' s most high-powered media lawyers , to represent it . Whatever the station ' s legal_rights may be , KNBC should apologize , said Steven Brill , editor in chief of American Lawyer magazine and founder of Court TV . &quot; They got_it wrong , &quot; Brill said . &quot; All of us ( in the media ) spend our lives trying to catch other people making mistakes , but we ' re terrible about admitting our own mistakes. &quot; Ito said he would hold a hearing next week on whether to ban KNBC-TV or all in-court television . It is not the first time the judge has grappled with issues of media coverage . He has considered imposing a gag order . And in late August , in a closed meeting with lawyers in the case , Ito directed the attorneys to file all motions under seal to ensure that he sees the documents before they are described in the media . On the question of TV in the courtroom , Ito appears to have more power to eliminate it than to bar one station . Several Supreme Court decisions have held that there is no absolute right to televise in the courtroom . &quot; There is no constitutional right to have ( live witness ) testimony recorded and broadcast &quot; and the &quot; requirement of a public trial is satisfied by the opportunity of members of the public and the press to attend the trial and to report what they have observed , &quot; the high_court said in the 1978 case Nixon vs . Warner Communications . Still , during the past two decades , there has been a steady loosening of restrictions on live television coverage of trials and pretrial proceedings . There are now cameras in courtrooms in virtually every state , including California , though they are still prohibited in federal_court . California trial_judges have broad discretion to decide whether to allow television coverage of courtroom proceedings under California Rule of Court 980 , originally adopted in 1966 and last revised in 1984 . There are very few cases interpreting the judge ' s authority under the rule . In 1990 , a California appellate_court held that a San Diego judge who granted television_stations permission to film the preliminary hearing of accused murderer Betty Broderick could not restrict their right to televise the testimony of certain witnesses . &quot; The rule does not authorize a judge to become the editor of a television_station ' s news broadcasts of a previously recorded judicial proceeding. &quot; The appeals court did not , however , make a broad ruling that the trial_judge had violated the station ' s constitutional rights . The court said that Rule 980 lets judges bar live television coverage where it would &quot; interfere with the rights of the parties , diminish the dignity of the court , or impede the orderly conduct of the proceedings. &quot; That decision indicates that Judge Ito &quot; would have a problem , legally , in retracting his Aug . 2 order permitting live coverage , &quot; said Los Angeles lawyer Douglas E . Mirell , who is monitoring the case for the American Civil Liberties Union . &quot; Absolutely nothing &quot; has happened since then to indicate any of the three criteria for halting live coverage has occurred , Mirell said . &quot; All that Judge Ito has expressed concern about are events that have occurred outside the courthouse . Nothing about the electronic coverage of the proceedings themselves has been the subject of complaint by the parties to the case , &quot; Mirell added . Dennis of Columbia University agreed . He said what is happening in the Simpson case is reminiscent in some respects of the massive media coverage precipitated by the kidnaping of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh ' s baby in 1932 . &quot; Up till that time , still cameras were allowed_in the courtroom , &quot; Dennis said . But the obstreperous conduct of photographers who leaped in front of defendant Bruno Hauptman and continually used &quot; blinding flash_cameras &quot; led to a ban on cameras that lasted almost 40 years , Dennis said . He emphasized that in contrast to the Simpson case , the offensive media conduct in the Lindbergh case occurred in the courtroom . But Dennis said he understood Ito ' s frustration . &quot; It must be a horrendous thing for a judge who is trying to be fair-minded and to impanel a jury to see this constant drumbeat of publicity , particularly factually inaccurate claims about evidence. &quot; &quot; I ' m not sure there is anything he can do to control this in the long_run , &quot; Dennis said . &quot; Ito is like one guy standing against a tidal_wave . . . . It could get worse. &quot; And that is why at least one attorney said he would not be troubled if Ito removed the cameras . &quot; Someone has to take_control of this case , &quot; said Los Angeles criminal defense_lawyer Barry Tarlow . &quot; Judge Ito is in an extraordinarily difficult situation and he is acting intelligently if he is attempting to impose a sanction on those members of the media who act irresponsibly . It is not the role of courts to boost television ratings , &quot; added Tarlow , who contended that Simpson has been the victim of a series of inaccurate leaks by police . Veteran defense_lawyer Barry Levin expressed similar concern . &quot; Judge Ito is trying to do everything in his power to make_sure the parties get a fair trial. &quot; He said Ito ' s threats &quot; may have a chilling effect on reporting , but it may have a positive effect on ( reporters ) checking sources. &quot; But Brill expressed doubt that Ito would halt live coverage . &quot; I think he understands the ultimate irony here is that more people have seen him denounce the KNBC report than saw the KNBC report because there was a camera in the courtroom , &quot; Brill said . &quot; If you didn ' t have the camera in the courtroom , you ' d only have the KNBC report on television and I think the judge understands that. &quot; TELEVISION BROADCASTS</TEXT>
