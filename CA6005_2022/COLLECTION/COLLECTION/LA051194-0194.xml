   <HEADLINE> ITALIAN PREMIER FORMS RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After prolonged haggling with ambitious , suspicious allies , Silvio Berlusconi , the billionaire turned politician , announced the formation Tuesday of the first right-wing Italian government since World_War_II . Berlusconi , the 57-year-old political newcomer who is one of Italy ' s richest_men , will be sworn_in this morning as prime_minister of the 53rd postwar government in Italy and the first with neo-fascist representation . Meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro after 11 days of wide-ranging talks and last-minute horse-trading , Berlusconi presented a Cabinet that he called &quot; a good team . . . above reproach. &quot; Two deputy prime_ministers represent controversial allies who stormed to victory with Berlusconi in March elections driven by voter disgust with institutionalized corruption . &quot; I ' ll try to bring_to government what I have learned in business all these years , &quot; Berlusconi said . His holdings include supermarkets , three national television_stations , magazines , real_estate and Italy ' s best soccer team . They reportedly did $ 7 billion in business last year and have a collective debt of about $ 2.3 billion . In presenting his government , Berlusconi said he is sure he can win required votes_of_confidence in both houses of the Italian Parliament . Roberto Maroni -- of the federalist Northern League and a stand-in for League founder Umberto Bossi -- was named to the key Interior ( Police ) Ministry as well as_to the deputy premiership . The League seeks a federal , decentralized Italy , and Bossi on occasion has talked_of splitting the country into three federal republics : north , central and south . Giuseppe Tatarella of the neo-fascist National Alliance became the other deputy prime_minister , as well as minister of post and telecommunications . Tatarella thus became the first of the political heirs of former dictator Benito Mussolini to hold Cabinet rank in half a century . Like Bossi , controversial neo-fascist leader Gianfranco Fini did not seek a Cabinet post . Nervousness over the unabashed right-wing nature of the government triggered an unprecedented letter to Berlusconi from Scalfaro on Tuesday . The Italian president , who is at least nominally above politics , reminded the Milan tycoon that his government is constitutionally obliged to respect the democratic institutions of an indivisible republic . Scalfaro asked Berlusconi to form a government on April 28 . It took 11 days principally because of Bossi ' s demands that the powerful Interior Ministry should go_to his party . Neither Berlusconi nor Fini liked the idea . Bossi threatened to withdraw from the coalition and railed against potential conflicts_of_interest in Berlusconi ' s assumption of political power atop his economic clout -- a concern that is still paramount among opposition parties .</TEXT>
