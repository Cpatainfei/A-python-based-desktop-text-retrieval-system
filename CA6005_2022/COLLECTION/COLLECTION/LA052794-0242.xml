   <HEADLINE> MEET THE MILK MAN ; NO , HE DOESN ' T LIKE TO DRINK IT . BUT JEFF GOODBY SURE CAN SELL IT . COULD IT BE THAT MILK WILL BECOME -- GULP -- A HIP DRINK ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are just two things in the world more boring than whole_milk : low-fat and skim . While Pepsi has its own generation , milk_can ' t muster one palpitation . No one cries over spilled milk -- they don ' t even notice . Milk is that nondescript stuff that you mix with equally nondescript powdered diet drinks . And anyone sent_on a milk run probably drew the short straw . Milk is for babies -- except those allergic to it . Oodles of health experts have put the kibosh on milk . Milkweed makes people sneeze . Milk_of_Magnesia makes people go . And that carton of milk sitting in your refrigerator since Halloween is quietly waiting to become cottage_cheese . Milk is -- even on its best day -- a real yawner . All of that said , there is one West Coast ad executive who is_on the brink of -- holy cow ! -- making milk halfway hip . With oddball humor that seems part Harvard Lampoon and part grammar_school , Jeff Goodby , creative director of Goodby , Silverstein &amp; Partners , is trying to turn the milk carton into an advertising icon that will do for milk what Mr. Whipple did for toilet_paper . What ' s more , his San Francisco agency is intent_on accomplishing this with just two words : &quot; Got milk ? &quot; You ' ve seen the commercials . Frustrated folks who run_out of milk at the wrong time -- like while eating a gloppy , gooey peanut_butter sandwich . If the 6-month-old ad_campaign succeeds -- and it appears well on its way to doing just that -- the agency could grab on to the advertising world ' s elusive brass ring : creating ads that people actually remember . Sure , Goodby is already recognized for creating knockout ads for American Isuzu Motors and Norwegian Cruise Line . In the wacky ad for Isuzu , a guy roars his off-road vehicle smack through the middle of a room-sized birthday_cake . In the haunting , Norwegian Cruise ads , one passenger makes this vow : &quot; I will be naked more often. &quot; For the National Basketball Assn. , the agency coined the ad slogan : &quot; I love this game. &quot; And its off-the-wall ads for Sega of America are so packed full of kid appeal that they have helped Sega out-cool Nintendo . But above all , any agency that can put pizazz into milk advertising could probably sell just about anything -- maybe even buttermilk . Industry executives predict that the &quot; Got Milk &quot; campaign -- seen mostly by Californians -- will garner the 12-year-old agency many of the top national and international awards in advertising . Three years ago , Advertising Age named Goodby , Silverstein the agency of the year . Two years ago , Adweek named it the West Coast agency of the year . But this year , the most important judges of all -- everyday consumers -- are lapping_up its milk ads . * that ' s fine with Jeff Goodby , who is the first to admit that he ' s no big milk drinker . Like many Americans , he lost the taste for milk somewhere between adolescence and adulthood , and replaced it with the_likes_of Perrier and Snapple . So , how to sell milk ? First off , forget all that stuff about milk building strong bones , Goodby says . And to heck with promoting all that vitamin stuff . Goodby says there is just one reason -- and one reason alone -- most people buy milk : because they ' ve run_out of it . &quot; The time you most notice milk is when it ' s gone , &quot; says Goodby , 42 , who discussed the campaign recently while in Los Angeles on break from directing a new &quot; Got Milk ? &quot; TV spot . &quot; We could make ads until we ' re blue in the face , but not many people are going_to come_in from jogging on a hot day and drink a tall glass of milk , &quot; he says . Ah , but who could pass_up a glass of milk with a peanut_butter sandwich ? Or milk in a bowl of cereal ? And , of course , milk with chocolate_chip_cookies ? These are the times when thirsty people crave milk . The agency unleashed a campaign that exaggerates these situations with the firm ' s trademark humor . The slogan was concocted by Goodby , a visual throwback to the generation who , in the 1960s , were among the first to begin turning thumbs down to milk . Goodby , who wears his hair to his shoulders and shuns tying it in a more socially acceptable ponytail ( &quot; Except in meetings with $ 30-million clients &quot; ) says he devised the &quot; Got Milk ? &quot; line during a staff meeting at the agency . &quot; When I said it , &quot; Goodby concedes , &quot; everyone just kind of shrugged. &quot; They ' re not shrugging anymore . For that matter , no one in the ad business can any longer shrug_off the uncanny success of this agency . Advertising has made Goodby a millionaire , several times over . But he rarely acts like one . For one thing , he giggles too_much . This is no made-for-TV-laugh-track type giggle , but the childlike kind that usually set his shoulders bouncing . Although his agency has two automotive clients -- Porsche and Isuzu -- Goodby drives a vehicle made by the less ostentatious of the two , an Isuzu Trooper . He also owns a sports_car -- a modest Mazda Miata his wife gave him for his 40th birthday . While on break from directing a milk spot in Culver City , Goodby seems far more interested in gobbling some broken pieces of chocolate_chip_cookies left over from the shoot than in munching the exotic hors d ' oeuvres that a catering firm was carting around the set . And it was Goodby , alone , who spent the day walking_around wearing goofy-looking booties that are specially made not to dirty the floor of the set . Although plenty of booties were made available for everyone , the rest of the crew seemed reluctant to wear such silly-looking slippers over their Doc Martens . &quot; Of all_the people in advertising , &quot; says Cathi Mooney , creative director of rival San Francisco agency Mandelbaum Mooney Ashley , &quot; Jeff is the only one I know who has complete integrity to do what is morally right -- and not just what will sell a product. &quot; When a giant chemical company approached his agency about handling a lucrative account , Goodby said no thanks . Ditto for a major West Coast defense firm . &quot; We ' re ' 60s people , &quot; explains Goodby , who stays connected to the ' 90s by listening to what he calls &quot; head banging &quot; music from alternative rock_groups such_as Sonic Youth and Smashing Pumpkins . And even though Goodby bums cigarettes from employees now and then , he says he would n ' t even consider making tobacco ads : &quot; When you have three young kids as I do , you don ' t want to create that kind of advertising. &quot; More an artist than copywriter , Goodby is passionate about drawing and photographing his daughters -- Grace , 1 , and Nina , 11 -- and 4-year-old son , Nathaniel . These paintings and photos fill the walls of his San Francisco office and Piedmont home . * Advertising has not always been Goodby ' s livelihood . He was raised in East Greenwich , R.I. , and graduated from Harvard in 1973 with a degree in English . His first job was as a City_Hall reporter at a small daily newspaper in Massachusetts . &quot; At parties , I ' ve always found it a lot more fun to tell people that I was a newspaper reporter than that I write TV commercials , &quot; Goodby says . He detests almost all advertising -- except his own . &quot; Unfortunately , &quot; he says , shaking his head while taking a swig of bottled water , &quot; I am judged by all_of the other advertising that ' s out there -- 99 % of which is awful. &quot; Goodby stumbled into his advertising career . Shortly after he married , he moved with his wife , Jan Deming , a landscape_architect , to San Francisco . &quot; I couldn ' t land a job as a reporter , &quot; Goodby recalls , &quot; so one day I randomly paged through the Yellow Pages. &quot; that ' s where , 15 years ago , he came_across the section labeled &quot; advertising agencies. &quot; &quot; At the time , &quot; he confesses , &quot; I didn ' t even know what an ad_agency did. &quot; But he started phoning agencies and asked if any had available jobs . With luck , he found one that did . And after working for several ad firms , including a stint with ad legend Hal Riney ( who later created the Bartles &amp; Jaymes characters for Gallo ) , Goodby and two pals , Richard Silverstein and Andy Berlin , left to form their own agency in 1983 -- an agency that promises employees a steady supply of 25-cent beers in the company soda machine . &quot; Always was . Always will be , &quot; vows the unconventional employee handbook . ( For a cold milk , employees have to head to the cappuccino stand down the street. ) The agency has thrived on being provocative . Its billboard ads for the San Francisco Examiner portrayed TV newscasters as Ken and Barbie dolls , leading one tough-talking TV_station manager to broadcast an angry rebuttal . Similarly , one TV spot created for a Honda Dealers group depicted Southern Californians as airheads . And while most clients are enchanted with the agency ' s work , several wondered aloud about the air of utter chaos that permeates the agency . &quot; Their work is spectacular , &quot; says Jeff Stutin , marketing director for Norwegian Cruise Line . &quot; But sometimes you ' ve got_to smack them around to get them in line. &quot; Instead of smacking them , however , milk executives want to hug them . * Perhaps no commercial crystallizes the meaning of the &quot; Got Milk ? &quot; slogan better than one featuring a peanut_butter sandwich . The offbeat ad has even managed to elevate Aaron Burr -- who heretofore was known as the former vice_president who in 1804 killed statesman Alexander Hamilton in a gun duel . Now , he ' s the guy in the milk ad : An Alexander Hamilton history buff is making a peanut_butter sandwich . His home is littered with Hamilton memorabilia . He even has the very bullet that killed Hamilton . The phone rings just as the buff takes a massive bite into his sandwich . A radio_announcer promises $ 10 # 000 if he can name the person who shot Hamilton . The historian can only muffle , &quot; Aawwan Buhhh. &quot; He grabs an empty milk carton and loses the contest . As the commercial ends , he ' s still muttering , &quot; Aawwan Buhhh. &quot; The client behind that ad , the California Milk Processor Board , says the campaign is an attempt to turn_around milk consumption in California , which has dropped a whopping 17 % since 1980 . Since the ad_campaign began seven months ago , it has developed a near-cult following . The agency constantly receives fan mail and suggestions for future milk ads . In fact , the milk spots have proven to be so popular_with consumers that the agency shot four more commercials in Los Angeles . * Among the most unusual of the new spots is one called &quot; Heaven , &quot; which Goodby directed . In the ad , a tyrannical executive dies and thinks he has gone_to Eternity -- until he discovers there is no milk around to help wash_down his chocolate_chip_cookies . An ambitious set director made_sure that everything was white . White furniture was everywhere . A white piano was hauled in and its black piano keys were whitened . White curtains hung from the windows . Even a white fish was imported to swim in a glass bowl . A heaven-like atmosphere of white clouds was created by mist generated from dry_ice and mineral_oil . And the white , marble-like floor was constantly swept by stagehands . About 50 chocolate_chip_cookies -- each about one foot in diameter -- were baked by a specially hired pastry chef who required an entire day to create them . The cookies were so gigantic that the chocolate chips aren ' t chips_at all , but whole Hershey Kisses . &quot; This is a pretty elaborate way to sell milk , &quot; Goodby admits . But the ads appear to be influencing some people to drink more milk . For the first time in years , milk consumption in the state is up among teen-agers and young adults , says Jeff Manning , executive_director of the Berkeley-based milk processor board . The ads have also generated some complaints . Several consumers complained about the bad manners of the historian who talks with his mouth full of peanut_butter . Meanwhile , the &quot; Got Milk ? &quot; campaign has also teamed_up with some_other natural partners in milk : like Wheaties and animal crackers . One wonders , can Milk Duds be far behind ? For Goodby , there are few illusions . &quot; The scariest part of it all is , what ' s next ? &quot; Goodby says . &quot; When will I ever get another good idea ? &quot; Then , he looks down for a moment at his bottle of designer water . His eyes widen . Can he possibly be thinking : Got water ?</TEXT>
