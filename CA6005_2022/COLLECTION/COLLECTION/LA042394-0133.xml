   <HEADLINE> HOME SAFETY ; VINTAGE ORANGE DISHWARE POSES THREAT FROM RADON GAS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The bright orange Fiesta dishware that many Americans use and collect could be giving_off enough radon gas to pose a significant health risk , a geologist says . &quot; When we test homes and look_for radon , we always suppose it comes from the ground , &quot; said Rudolph Hon of Boston College . &quot; Maybe we need to make the public aware that some of it can be coming from the cabinet. &quot; Fiesta ceramics made before 1972 &quot; should be always considered as suspect &quot; in homes where radon levels are high , concluded Hon and a graduate_student , Christopher Zeman , in a paper presented recently in Binghamton , N.Y. , to a meeting of the Geological Society of America . The dishes ' radioactive properties -- gamma_ray emissions from uranium-based paint in the bright orange variety -- have been known for decades . The finding that the paint is also producing significant amounts of radon gas is new , Hon said . Fiesta dishware sold by the millions in the 1930s and 1940s , and became one of the largest-selling lines in the country . It has recently become popular again among collectors , and is widely available in antique shops and flea_markets . Zeman , 22 , said the study found that a single Fiesta plate in an unventilated , 15-by-15-foot room would produce radioactive radon gas at 28 picocuries per liter -- a concentration seven times the level considered safe by the federal_government . The gas , radon-222 , is produced by the gradual decay of uranium-238 . The radon is believed to escape_from the plates through microscopic cracks in the glaze . Fiesta ware in other colors is not radioactive , Hon said . More_than half the radiation to which Americans are exposed each year is believed to come from naturally occurring radon . It is a Class A carcinogen , ranked by the federal_government in the same category with secondhand tobacco smoke , benzene and asbestos . Emitted from rocks and soil and accumulated in poorly ventilated homes , radon may be responsible_for up_to 20 # 000 lung_cancer deaths a year in the United States , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . However , the National Research Council suggests the EPA ' s figure may be too high . In those homes found to have high levels of radon , the EPA recommends using good ventilation in the home to reduce exposures to a_level of 4 picocuries per liter or below . ( In Southern California , the incidence of problems with naturally occurring radon gas are much lower than in other parts of the country. ) Frank Marcinowski , a health physiologist with the EPA ' s radon division , said his agency has asked Hon for more information on his study . Radon emissions from Fiesta ware are &quot; perfectly feasible , &quot; he said . &quot; The isotopes I ' m aware of in the Fiesta ware glazing are parent isotopes of radon. &quot; If Hon ' s radon measurements are accurate , Marcinowski said , &quot; that level is definitely a cause for concern. &quot; The dishware -- most of it marked &quot; Fiesta &quot; and &quot; Made in U.S.A. &quot; on the bottom -- was manufactured by the Homer Laughlin China Co . in Newell , W.Va. &quot; We believe Fiesta is the largest-selling dinner line in the history of the industry , &quot; said David Conley , the company ' s national sales manager . Twelve million pieces in a variety of colors were shipped annually at its peak in the 1930s and 1940s , and perhaps 200 million in all since it was introduced in 1936 . The uranium-bearing orange variety was discontinued in 1943 when the government placed wartime restrictions on uranium . Production resumed in 1959 when the restrictions were lifted and continued until 1972 . In 1976 , the company reintroduced the Fiesta line , but the orange color could not be duplicated with the new lead- and uranium-free glazes . * Fiesta ware in its original colors has become a collector ' s item , and prices have climbed accordingly . A dinner_plate that sold for 35 cents in 1936 is now worth $ 25 to $ 30 , Conley said . Other brand names that used uranium-based pigments included Caliente , Early California , Poppytrail , Stangl and Vistosa , according to the federal Food and Drug Administration . For consumers , the uranium in Fiesta ware poses health issues that differ from those associated with radon gas . The ionizing radiation from uranium can be a cancer hazard , depending_on its strength , duration and distance from the body . If ingested , uranium is chemically harmful to the kidneys . A 1992 study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that highly acidic foods can leach uranium from Fiesta ware at levels ranging from 24 to 1 # 600 times those considered safe for drinking_water . The study said acidic foods , such_as tomato_sauce , sauerkraut , vinegar and orange_juice , should not be consumed from such dinnerware . Fiesta ' s manufacturer says that ' s good advice for any type of old dinnerware . &quot; We would not recommend storing anything with a high acid content for a long period_of_time , &quot; Conley said . Responding to a warning by New York state health authorities about the danger of uranium leaching from orange Fiesta ware , the FDA said in 1981 that the &quot; levels of radioactive material in ceramic tableware are not considered hazardous. &quot; The FDA warned , however , that eating or drinking from the orange dishes &quot; should be avoided as unnecessary exposure to radioactive materials. &quot; Display by collectors was ruled safe .</TEXT>
