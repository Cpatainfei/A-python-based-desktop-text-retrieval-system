   <HEADLINE> NEW SERB PEACE BID SEEN AS PLOY , BUT FEW DISMISS IT OUTRIGHT ; BALKANS : BOSNIAN REBEL LEADER MAY BE TRYING TO SOFTEN INTERNATIONAL RESOLVE WITH INVITATION TO JIMMY_CARTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new Bosnian Serb peace offer that would require the mediation of former President Jimmy_Carter was widely viewed Thursday as a calculated ploy to further undermine the international community ' s teetering resolve in Bosnia . But after nearly three years of civil_war and countless failed peace efforts , few were willing to dismiss the new initiative outright for fear of missing an opportunity to end the conflict , the bloodiest in Europe since World_War_II . &quot; I don ' t think anybody will object to any steps that can help end the killing , improve the humanitarian condition and ease tensions that exist between the Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Serbs , &quot; State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said . For officials here and in Bosnia-Herzegovina , who favor an internationally approved peace plan that would divide the country roughly in half , the new offer fell far short of a breakthrough in the tense stalemate between the two warring sides . Less than 12 hours after Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic disclosed his new proposal , a U.N. helicopter near Sarajevo was hit by small arms and antiaircraft_fire while en route to pick_up the U.N. commander in Bosnia , Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , a U.N. spokesman said . It was not clear who was responsible_for the attack , but speculation centered_on Bosnian Serb troops , who were also reported to have blocked food and other humanitarian aid deliveries throughout Bosnia despite pledges by Karadzic to end such harassment . &quot; The situation is still quite bleak , &quot; said Michael C . Williams , spokesman for Yasushi Akashi , the U.N. special envoy in the former Yugoslavia . U.N. officials said they were taken by surprise by the late-night proposal from Karadzic , which was disclosed in a telephone_interview with CNN shortly before midnight Wednesday in Bosnia . Karadzic talked with CNN after speaking by telephone to Carter in Plains , Ga. , from Pale , the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb capital near Sarajevo . Earlier , Karadzic sent two Los Angeles-area Serbian Americans to meet with the former President and lay the groundwork , diplomatic sources said . A U.N. spokesman said the telephone_conversations with Karadzic violated a U.N. Security_Council resolution that bans all commercial_activity -- including the use of international telecommunication links -- with the Bosnian Serbs without approval from the U.N. Protection Force . &quot; The resolution was clearly meant to punish the Bosnian Serbs by restricting commercial ties , &quot; spokesman Paul Risley said . &quot; A telephone_call with Pale breaks international sanctions. &quot; Karadzic said in the CNN interview that he is willing to impose a cease-fire in the Sarajevo area , free detained U.N. troops , allow the movement of humanitarian relief , release teen-age Muslim prisoners_of_war , reopen Sarajevo airport and guarantee human_rights . In return , he wants Carter to fly to Bosnia to begin negotiations for a permanent settlement , possibly as early as this weekend . U.N. officials were clearly miffed by the Bosnian Serbs ' end_run , particularly since Akashi had met with Karadzic earlier Wednesday and the Bosnian Serb leader had made no mention of a new peace initiative . Williams said Karadzic actually refused in the meeting to accept several demands by Akashi that later turned_up in Karadzic ' s offer to Carter . &quot; The six points of this peace plan do not represent peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina , &quot; Williams said . &quot; This is simply taking us back where we were two months ago , which was not so grand then. &quot; U.N. officials and Western diplomats said they feared Karadzic was attempting to drive a wedge into the peace plan already approved by the Muslim-led Bosnian government and neighboring Serbia . The plan , which would give the Bosnian Serbs 49 % of Bosnian territory , was negotiated by the so-called Contact Group , consisting_of the United States , Britain , France , Germany and Russia . Karadzic has rejected that plan , but the Contact Group has refused to back_away from it . The group , which met in Zagreb on Thursday , reiterated its support for the plan and said no further negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs will be possible until they accept it . &quot; Once we have an accepted peace plan , then there is a basis for further talks , because there are other issues to be resolved , &quot; said Michael Steiner , the German ambassador to the Contact Group . &quot; But we need to have this common basis first. &quot; Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic said Contact Group members assured him that they would not retreat from the plan , even with the new Karadzic proposal and Carter ' s likely involvement . Silajdzic said Carter ' s participation would constitute a &quot; destruction &quot; of the peace process if it focused_on anything but gaining Bosnian Serb approval of the existing peace plan . &quot; Those initiatives that are not intended to lead to the acceptance of the peace plan are destructions , &quot; Silajdzic said . &quot; We have the Contact Group plan that we worked_on for months . . . . We accepted the peace plan , and all we want is for the other side to accept that plan. &quot; U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in New York that Carter had assured him that his involvement would be &quot; fully synchronized &quot; with the work of the Contact Group , according to a spokesman . But Steiner said Carter had not been in touch with the group before or after his discussions with Karadzic and his Los Angeles emissaries . Western diplomats here were skeptical that such assurances could be honored anyway , saying Karadzic would not have solicited Carter ' s involvement simply to talk_about a peace plan that he had already rejected . Col . Andrew Duncan of the Institute for Strategic Studies in London said there is a danger that separate talks by Carter , who would have no official standing , could do more harm than good . &quot; It creates all sorts of chances for misunderstandings , &quot; Duncan said . &quot; There are already enough groups and people involved. &quot; NATO Secretary_General Willy Claes also expressed puzzlement over Carter ' s role . &quot; I don ' t see why it is necessary to ask_for a former President of the United States to come_in in_order to get a cease-fire , &quot; Claes said in Brussels . &quot; I do not believe that if there is a willingness ( by the Bosnian Serbs ) for a cease-fire there is a need for an intermediary. &quot; By drawing Carter into the fray , Karadzic seems bent_on circumventing the route to peace set_out by the international community in the partition plan , Western diplomats in Zagreb said . His ultimate goal may be to come_up with an alternative plan more favorable to the Bosnian Serbs that would carry Carter ' s name and ultimately erode support for the Contact Group plan -- perhaps splitting the group itself . &quot; It is another master stroke , &quot; said one Western official in Zagreb . &quot; He has made fools out of us so many times already. &quot; But Clinton_Administration officials , who on Thursday offered Carter an Air_Force jet and support staff if he travels_to Bosnia , said that Karadzic may be looking_for a way to end the conflict without appearing to knuckle_under to international pressure . By visiting the Bosnian Serb leader in his self-proclaimed capital of Pale , Carter would give him a measure of the respect and international legitimacy that Karadzic seeks , possibly allowing him to claim victory while accepting perms he previously rejected , the officials said . &quot; It ' s impossible to fully understand Karadzic ' s motives , but I would suggest that it does have something to do with the fact that he is facing pressure and he is facing the prospect of a war that will continue to drain resources from the Bosnian Serb community in Bosnia and continue to result in the deaths of his fellow citizens , &quot; McCurry said . One Western diplomat in Zagreb said the U.S. view in part amounts to wishful_thinking . &quot; Everyone is very skeptical , but we ' re at the point where you have to say , ' Heck , go_with whatever works , ' &quot; the diplomat said . Times staff writers Jack Nelson , Norman Kempster and Stanley Meisler in Washington , and Tyler Marshall in Brussels contributed to this report .</TEXT>
