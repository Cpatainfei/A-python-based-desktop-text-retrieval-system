   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; BRIDGING THE RIVER JORDAN ; TREATY PLACES ANOTHER PIECE IN THE MIDEAST PUZZLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shortly after the shooting stopped in the 1973 Middle_East War , Israelis told each other that they could not know which Arab state would first make_peace with Israel but they were certain which would be second -- Jordan . It took more_than 15 years after the 1979 signing of the Egypt-Israel pact , but the prophecy was fulfilled Wednesday in an emotional ceremony along the sunbaked border as Israel and Jordan signed the region ' s second formal peace_treaty . The hostility between Israel and Jordan has never been quite as hard-edged as the animosity between Israel and its other neighbors . Moreover , Jordan and Israel are joined by geography in a way that seems to demand cooperation if either nation is to reach its full economic potential . At the same time , King Hussein , Jordan ' s cautious monarch , was reluctant to get too far ahead of the Arab consensus . He showed no inclination to be a precedent-setter , and he never even came_close to copying Anwar Sadat , the Egyptian president who was shunned and isolated by the Arab world after he made_peace with Israel . That Hussein is willing to move now dramatizes a shifting post-Cold War reality : Syria no longer has a superpower patron to support its former policy of bullying Jordan and other Arab states into refusing to make a separate peace with Israel until all Arab countries were ready for a comprehensive settlement . But it is also a victory for Israel ' s generation-old policy of dealing with the Arab countries one at a time , even when that approach seemed to be leading nowhere . The way the Israeli government sees it , it is easier to negotiate a treaty bridging the differences between Israel and a single Arab state than it is to draft language that all Arab countries will accept . And , at least as important , if one Arab government makes_peace with Israel , it increases the pressure on all_the others to come_around eventually or be left_behind . The different Israeli and Arab approaches to peacemaking produced years of stalemate after the signing of the Israel-Egypt pact . Serious negotiations did not really get started until October , 1991 , when all_of the parties to the conflict met at a U.S.-brokered peace conference in Madrid . That gathering was carefully balanced to permit the Israelis to claim that it was a series of bilateral negotiations and the Arabs to say it was a comprehensive conference . But in the end , the scale was tilted toward the Arab approach . When Yitzhak Rabin was elected Israeli prime_minister -- succeeding Yitzhak Shamir , who led the delegation to Madrid -- he announced that he would continue with the Madrid process , although he opposed its emphasis on dealing with all_the Arab states at once . In practice , Rabin simply ignored the Madrid focus and sought to take_on the Arabs one at a time . His first priority was Syria , but when that approach seemed to lead to a dead_end , he reached toward an agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization . The Israel-PLO agreement has not met the expectations of either side , but it helped clear the way for Israel and Jordan to reach the full-scale peace_treaty signed Wednesday . The pact with Jordan is an achievement for Israel on its face . But it also upsets Syria and the PLO , a situation that the Israelis consider an added benefit . Both Syrian President Hafez Assad and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat objected to the Israel-Jordan deal , but in a much more restrained fashion than might have been the case a_few years ago . Katyusha rockets , believed to have been fired by the Syrian-backed Hezbollah militia from southern Lebanon , struck northern Israel just before the Israel-Jordan ceremony began , but they caused little damage . Israeli officials concede privately that the rockets were probably intended to miss , delivering a message without risking a major conflict . However , Assad may be in a petulant mood when he meets President Clinton today in Damascus . U.S. officials hope that the Clinton-Assad talks will help to advance the peace process , but they admit that they do not know what Assad will do . U.S. officials believe that Assad is more concerned about building a relationship with Washington than making_peace with Israel . So Clinton is expected to emphasize that , unless Assad climbs aboard the peace bandwagon , he risks alienating Washington . The PLO objects to a provision of the Israel-Jordan treaty recognizing Jordan ' s role as &quot; custodian &quot; of the Islamic holy_places in East Jerusalem . The PLO , which covets the predominantly Arab sector of Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state , objected emotionally . Israel agreed to the provision because it was an easy way to give Hussein a new benefit of peace and , perhaps more important , because it sent a clear message to the PLO that Israel was determined to maintain its hold_on all_of Jerusalem . Since the signing of the Israel-PLO agreement at the White_House more_than a year ago , the Israeli authorities have been ambivalent in their relationship with the organization . On one hand , the Israeli government wants the peace agreement to work . But on the other , the Israelis want to keep the PLO off balance , at least for the foreseeable future . Redrawing Borders in War and Peace The borders that Israel shares with its neighbors have been redrawn several times . Here is a look_at some of the changes . Armistice borders 1949 : The borders of Israel after it declared independence and fought first war with Arab neighbors . Israeli occupation 1967 : The territories Israel captured from Syria , Jordan and Egypt after the Six-Day War . Current borders 1994 : Israel began returning captured territory after signing its peace_treaty with Egypt in 1979 . The treaty Israel signed with Jordan on Wednesday provides_for border adjustments . Here are the steps_in the Jewish state ' s relinquishment of territory . Sinai_Peninsula : Ceded back to Egypt in 1979 . Gaza Strip , Jericho : Under Palestinian self-rule since May , 1994 . Jordan : Israel will lease back farmland returned to Jordan . The two states will also make land exchanges .</TEXT>
