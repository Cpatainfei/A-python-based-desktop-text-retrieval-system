   <HEADLINE> POP EYE : THANKS FOR GOING ONLINE , COURTNEY , BUT COULD YOU MIND YOUR LANGUAGE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that we know that it really is Courtney Love sending all those messages to fans through America Online , we ' re getting a rare chance to hear an artist speak directly to her fans . Unlike print and television profiles , there ' s no way in computer bulletin_boards that your words can be tampered with , right ? Well . . . . Some America Online regulars are up in arms over the fact that some of Love ' s computer missives have been deleted -- possibly because of profanity or potentially inflammatory comments . &quot; When subscribers sign_up , they agree to our terms of service , &quot; says AOL spokeswoman Pam McGraw . &quot; They agree not to submit or display any defamatory , inaccurate , abusive or obscene language . Judgments about what is appropriate are made by forum leaders , who are not employees , but participants who want to manage the discussions on line. &quot; Love ' s postings have been among the hottest items on the service . She ' s been regularly signing_on using the code names CMLC ( her full initials ) and BRRRKNSTOK but has done little to hide her identity , sometimes even signing the notes with her real name . They can usually be found in the folders labeled &quot; Hole &quot; ( the name of her band ) , &quot; Cobain &quot; and &quot; International Pop Underground. &quot; In recent notes , Kurt Cobain ' s widow has attacked her biological father , various figures in the Northwest rock underground and those who would capitalize on Cobain ' s death through quickie books and films . Her complaint about her father , author Hank Harrison ( whom Love refers to as &quot; biodad &quot; ) , stems from his going on &quot; Geraldo &quot; to discuss Cobain ' s life and death even though he never met the Nirvana leader . Another favorite target : Slim Moon , owner of the small Olympia-based record label called Kill Rock_Stars . Love claims that Moon owes her substantial royalties stemming from the inclusion of one of her songs on a compilation released by the company several years ago . Both Moon and Harrison are America Online users as well and have used the forum to respond to Love ' s accusations . Slim Moon says that he considers Love ' s statements about him to be both defamatory and inaccurate . &quot; She said I made $ 200 # 000 off a record that her husband ' s band contributed one song to and that I did not pay the royalties , &quot; he says . &quot; Both those statements are false . . . and I don ' t think a public forum was the place to discuss it anyway. &quot; He and Love continued the debate via private e-mail , through which he says he provided documentation about the royalties . Here are some samples of Love ' s on-line writings -- typos and misspellings left as she wrote them : * &quot; im home , surrounded by much needed 24 hour security . . . a new cylone electronic fence w sensors , a rottweiler , a german shepard and a baby chowdog for the bean &quot; ( describing the current home life of her and daughter Frances Bean Cobain ) . * &quot; IM LITIGATING JUST FOR FUN , THERES NO ASSETS BUT IT OUGHT TO COST YOU EVERYTHING YOU EVER MADE OFF KURT OR ME , THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW SLIM , YOU WERE NOT HIS FRIEND &quot; ( part of a message directed at Kill Rock_Star ' s Slim Moon , who she says owes her back royalties ) . * &quot; a note to all you biographers out there ; YOU ARE ALL WRITING ME THE SAME LETTER AND AT THIS POINT YOU ARE ALL MALE i wish i could show you all_the form_letter you are sening , the vaguelt threatening ton , the &quot; This book WILL be written &quot; platitudeand the im the guy to do_it blanket statement &quot; Steve Hochman</TEXT>
