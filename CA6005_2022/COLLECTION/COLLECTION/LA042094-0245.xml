   <HEADLINE> RWANDA OFFERS NO SANCTUARY FROM CHAOS ; CENTRAL_AFRICA : MISSIONARIES REPORTING BLOODLETTING ARE STUNNED THAT HOLY_PLACES AREN ' T SAFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Killing frenzies and large-scale massacres are spreading from the Rwandan capital of Kigali to many parts of the anarchic hinterland , Roman_Catholic missionaries here said Tuesday . Amid new fighting and the shelling of refugees in Kigali , missionaries devoted to what is nominally Africa ' s most Catholic country told of heartbreak and heroism in a tortured land . A Spanish nun recounted how hospital patients paid their executioners for swift death . And a 76-year-old Italian lay missionary told her son by radio that food is almost gone but &quot; I am not leaving without the children &quot; -- 42 orphans marooned in the lawless countryside . Reports filtering into the headquarters of missionary organizations by telephone and radio Tuesday from Burundi and other neighboring countries depicted apocalyptic savagery . &quot; I spoke with a senior church official in Burundi this morning who told of horrible new massacres in Rwandan parishes near the border . The killing continues . We will never know how many died , but I believe it must be 100 # 000 already , &quot; said the Rev . Pedro Sala , assistant general of the Society of Missionaries of Africa , the largest_order of foreign priests . One French member of the order was killed in the violence that has gripped the nation of 7 million since earlier this month . Sala , who was in Kigali when the killing started April 6 after the deaths of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi , said massacres have spread in recent days to areas east and west of the capital where most people are members of the Tutsi minority . Tuesday ' s reports told of &quot; horrible massacres &quot; of civilians in the parishes of Cyahinda and Kibeho near the Burundian border , Sala said . Soldiers and civilians of the Hutu majority committed the atrocities in Kigali , missionaries say . In Kigali , fighting continues between the mostly Hutu army and mostly Tutsi insurgents while surviving civilians huddle for their lives in usually ramshackle dwellings without electricity , water or food . Reuters news_agency reported from Kigali on Tuesday that nine Rwandans were killed and 170 more were wounded when 30 shells slammed into a crowd of around 4 # 000 hungry refugees at the national soccer stadium , a landmark of the desolated capital . &quot; This is a battle for power , for economic advantage and for survival that is being fought in the context of a race war , &quot; said Sala , who served six years as pastor of a Kigali parish . The Rev . Franiszek Filipiec , a Polish priest with the Marian Fathers , who have a large mission in a rebel-controlled area of northern Rwanda , said there were reports of massacres of dozens of people in different settlements in the region . Violence between Hutus and the Tutsi is a tragic constant of national life in Rwanda , Africa ' s most densely populated country . Still , the current round of killing has stunned missionaries in part because the rampage of machete-wielding mobs and army troops has violated the unwritten rules of ethnic conflict . &quot; Always before , frightened people sheltered safely at churches and in the compounds and residences of the religious . This time there is no asylum . We don ' t understand why they will not respect the holy_places . Women and children have been wantonly slaughtered , sick children murdered in their hospital_beds . It surpasses understanding , &quot; Filipiec said . Missionaries say about 20 priests have been murdered , almost all_of them Rwandan and almost all Tutsi . Even as dawn broke on the morning after the plane crash that killed Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprian Ntayamira , troops of the elite Presidential Guard raided a retreat house in Kigali run_by the Society_of_Jesus , the Jesuits . Three Belgian Jesuits were locked_up in one room . In another , the soldiers killed 11 nuns , three Rwandan Jesuits and five other African priests . Nuns and priests appear to have been &quot; the principal target &quot; as the violence began , the Rev . Peter-Hans Kolvenbach , head of the Jesuit order , said in a letter to senior leaders of the order . Of the stories now emerging from the Rwandan slaughter , none is more tragic than that of Spanish Sister Pilar of the Missionaries of Jesus , Mary and Joseph . The 63-year-old missionary told reporters in Madrid that when the killers came_to a hospital the nuns ran in the town of Kibuye , about 50 miles from Kigali , the patients realized they had no chance . &quot; The patients , who died by the hundreds , paid the assassins to kill them quickly and not with machetes , &quot; she said . &quot; We saw children of 6 killing with machetes . Many of them were Catholics , and we knew them. &quot; Sister Pilar said the nuns hid Tutsi patients , a nurse and four orphans and convinced Hutu killers that all_the Tutsi were dead by showing them heaps of bodies . There were around 1 # 100 nuns and 500 priests in Rwanda when Pope John Paul II visited in September , 1990 . Around 70 Catholic missionary orders , mainly European , work in Rwanda , but six pulled_up stakes last year and Filipiec expects that 20 more may follow them . About two-thirds of foreign missionaries who make_up the majority of the country ' s priests have left the country , with the remainder either unable to leave or refusing to go . One missionary who is staying is Amelia Barbieri , an obstetrician who answered a magazine call_for lay missionaries 10 years ago . At 76 , she runs an orphanage near Muhura in an area controlled by Tutsi rebels . There are tens of thousands of refugees outside and 42 orphans inside with Barbieri and a handful of Rwandan assistants , her son Piercarlo said by phone from the family home_in northern Italy . &quot; On Monday , Mama was afraid they would be attacked . Today she told us on the radio that they were safe but there was very little food left . She could have left , but she ' s insisted from the first day that she would not go without the children . She says if she goes it ' s their death sentence , &quot; the missionary ' s son said .</TEXT>
