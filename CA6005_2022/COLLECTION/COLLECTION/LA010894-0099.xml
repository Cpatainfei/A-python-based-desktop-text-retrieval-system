   <HEADLINE> PRESERVING GENETIC DIVERSITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I read with interest &quot; Dangers of Narrowing the Field &quot; ( Column One , Dec . 23 ) . The article correctly raises concerns over the loss of genetic diversity . It is a significant issue requiring attention . However , to preserve germ_plasm that does not have an immediate use requires money . Commercial agriculture operates_on a narrow margin . Universities with colleges of agricultural sciences have also been under serious financial pressure for several years . At the time when universities are needed to do more , they have fewer resources with which to accomplish tasks . Preserving genetic diversity is one such timely issue . Your article tends to overlook , however , that a highly efficient agriculture is perhaps the best defense against environmental degradation . Where people have adequate supplies of nutritious and economically priced food , there is little reason for them to burn forests or intrude_into other fragile environments in an attempt to feed their families . The development of high-yielding strains of both plant and animal varieties has made_possible an abundance of quality food . The university , within the limits of its funding base , is proceeding to develop sustainable technology that helps address the problem . One of our distinguished alumni , Lyle McNeal , director of the Navajo Sheep Project in Utah , has done wonderful work in attempting to preserve and improve the Navajo-Churro sheep . All such endeavors , however , have largely been funded through private sector resources . The problems raised must be addressed . It will require dollars . In times of financial duress , it is the long-range need that is forgotten in terms of immediate survival . ALLEN C . CHRISTENSEN Dean , College of Agriculture Cal Poly Pomona * Your fascinating story on the dramatic decline in the variety of agricultural animals and crops drove_home the importance of preserving biodiversity . It is our ticket to a livable future . This country has been the pioneer in saving species . Twenty years ago Congress passed the Endangered Species Act . A number of species have made dramatic comebacks since the act protected them , including the bald_eagle , California gray_whale , whooping_crane , and peregrine_falcon . Unfortunately , these success stories have been drowned_out by controversies over the Stephens kangaroo_rat and the northern spotted owl . Biodiversity is important for many reasons in addition to our planet ' s food supply . More_than 25 % of our nation ' s pharmaceuticals are derived from natural substances -- many of them from obscure plants and animals that have names that might sound strange . Taxol is derived from the bark of the Pacific_yew tree , which logging companies used to burn as &quot; trash &quot; only three years ago . Now , it turns_out to be an effective treatment for breast and ovarian cancer . Not only do such products save lives , they provide financial benefits to their manufacturers and others in the production chain . The Endangered Species Act is up for reauthorization . It should be strengthened . A bill that would do just that ( H.R. 2043 ) has 100 co-sponsors , including 19 from California . Anyone who believes we ought to save species -- whether for moral or selfish reasons -- should let Congress know .
