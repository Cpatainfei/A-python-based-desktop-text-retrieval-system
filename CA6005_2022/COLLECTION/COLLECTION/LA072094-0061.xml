   <HEADLINE> BILL BOYARSKY : LATINO VOTERS COULD EXERCISE SIZABLE CLOUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ever since I moved to Los Angeles in 1970 , I ' ve anticipated the Latino political revolution . Skeptical academics , pollsters , campaign consultants and political writing colleagues assured me it would never happen . They obviously thought the question of Latino power had been settled when Mexico lost the war with the United States and signed the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 . Their analysis made superficial sense . Latino voting turnout was small . Statewide registration drives didn ' t live_up_to their promise . No Latinos hold statewide office . A Times poll of voters leaving the polling_booths after the 1992 presidential election found that just 7 % were Latino . The figure was 6 % in a Times poll post-election survey of June , 1994 , primary voters . The numbers are especially small considering that California ' s population is 28 % Latino . But there ' s more to the story than these numbers . * I ' ve noticed that in the San Gabriel Valley , a vast stretch of suburbia and manufacturing towns reaching from East Los Angeles to San Bernardino County . To a lot of people , the future of L.A. is described in the urban nightmare of a movie called &quot; Blade Runner. &quot; But to me , the San Gabriel Valley is a much better illustration of where we ' ve been and where we ' re going . Settled by the Gabrielino Indians more_than 1 # 000 years ago , the valley was taken_over first by Spain , then Mexico and finally the United States . Its population has again changed dramatically in the last 40 years . From a predominantly white , middle-class enclave , the valley has become a rich and complex mixture of whites , Latinos , Asians and African Americans . Their life , to a great extent , is suburban . The single-family home remains an attainable dream . When I stop in San Gabriel Valley city_halls and school district headquarters , I ' ve seen that that a large_number , often a majority , of the council and school_board members are Latinos . If Latinos weren ' t voting , I wondered , how did all these people get elected ? At the same time , Latinos were increasing their representation in the L.A. County legislative delegation in Sacramento , as well as on the Los Angeles City_Council and , for the first time , on the County Board of Supervisors . The numbers are part of a statewide phenomenon . Francisco Dominguez of the National Assn . of Latino Elected Officials told me that from 1984 to 1993 , the number of Latino elected officials in California increased from 460 to 797 . It ' s this growing number of Latinos elected to local office that has encouraged Latino political activists to predict a larger vote this year . &quot; I think all_the pieces are in place for a dynamite turnout of Latinos in a governor ' s race , &quot; said Antonio Gonzalez , director of the Southwest Voter Research Institute , a leading Latino voter education and registration organization . First of all , Gonzalez cites the growing number of Latino local officials , a sign of political activity in the Latino grass-roots . If people worry about school_board members , his theory goes , then they ' ll turn_out when it comes_to governor and U.S. senator . He also said that Latino turnout should be pushed_up by the presence on the ballot of the SOS -- Save Our State -- initiative , which cuts_off public education and non-emergency medical_care to illegal immigrants . Opponents of the measure call it racist and anti-Latino . Significantly , a Times poll in May showed that not all Latinos agree . Although 57 % opposed it , a substantial number , 35 % , said they would vote yes . Finally , a Latino , Democratic state Sen . Art Torres of Los Angeles , is running_for insurance commissioner . The prospect of a Latino in statewide office may increase the vote_in Latino communities . * A substantial Latino vote could be an important factor_in determining the November elections , especially for the Democrats . The majority of Latinos are registered Democrats and Treasurer Kathleen Brown , the candidate for governor , and U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein will need almost all_of them to win . In 1978 , the last time Democrats elected a governor , Democratic registration was 57 % of the electorate . This year , it ' s down to 49 % . &quot; Electing a Democratic governor today is much more challenging in terms of the numbers , &quot; said John Whitehurst , a Brown spokesman . &quot; Thus this ( Latino ) effort is critical . We must maximize votes_in any place we can. &quot; Republican candidates usually get_about 30 % of the Latino vote , although Ronald Reagan received more . Anything Gov . Pete Wilson and GOP Senate candidate Rep . Michael Huffington get above the 30 % mark is a bonus . In the long_run , the size of the turnout is more important than party allegiance . Election_Day ' s cold , hard figures will determine whether Latinos will have a stronger voice in education , immigration , health_care and other issues that shape life in their community , no matter which party wins .</TEXT>
