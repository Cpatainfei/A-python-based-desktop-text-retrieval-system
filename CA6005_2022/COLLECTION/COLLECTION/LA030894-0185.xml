   <HEADLINE> NEW CHAIRMAN TO SERVE CARL ' S JR . CHAIN ; FOOD : WILLIAM FOLEY II LED INVESTOR GROUP THAT ACQUIRED A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN CARL KARCHER ENTERPRISES . RESTRUCTURING IS ALSO PLANNED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> William P . Foley II , who led an investor group late last year that acquired a controlling interest in Carl Karcher Enterprises , has been elected chairman of the Carl ' s Jr . fast food_chain , replacing interim chairman Elizabeth A . Sanders . The fast food_company also is seeking shareholder approval for a corporate restructuring that includes the creation of CKE Restaurants Inc. , a new Delaware- based holding company that would oversee Karcher Enterprises ' restaurant businesses . Karcher Enterprises President Donald E . Doyle said the restructuring was driven by the company ' s recent expansion beyond the Carl ' s Jr . fast food_chain and into the fast-growing rotisserie chicken restaurant business . Karcher Enterprises in January became the exclusive franchisee for Boston Chicken restaurants in Southern California and Sacramento . In a related announcement , Karcher Enterprises said it is seeking federal Securities and Exchange Commission approval to sell_up to $ 75 million in securities , largely to help fund construction of Boston Chicken restaurants . The emergence of Foley , 48 , as chairman apparently signals the end of a bitter struggle in which the company ' s founder , Carl N . Karcher , was forced_out of the chairman ' s office during a highly publicized feud over the company ' s strategic direction . &quot; It ' s been alluded to in the past that ( Sanders ) was an interim chairman , and that the role would pass to someone else , &quot; said Laurie Lively Smith , a Los Angeles-based analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. &quot; And it seemed to be a given that if ( Foley ) wanted it , the chairman ' s role was his. &quot; Foley , chairman and chief_executive of Irvine-based Fidelity National Financial Inc. , in December led a group that took_control of 22 % of Karcher Enterprises stock in return for helping Carl N . Karcher restructure nearly $ 30 million in personal debt . Foley earlier said he was a &quot; logical &quot; candidate for the chairman ' s role and that he wanted the company ' s founder back as chairman emeritus . Sanders , who was selected to succeed Karcher in October , will remain on Karcher Enterprises ' board . Foley said Monday that Karcher Enterprises is &quot; taking the first_steps now in what is going_to be a good , long program of development . . . . We ' re going to have the roll-out of the new ( Carl ' s Jr. ) value menu , we ' ve got Boston Chicken going , and hopefully , earnings and revenue will develop. &quot; In a related development , Karcher Enterprises and the company ' s 76-year-old company founder have hammered_out an employment_agreement that board_members are expected to approve during a Wednesday meeting . &quot; It ' s my belief that everything will be finalized Wednesday , &quot; said Andrew Puzder , Karcher ' s attorney . Karcher , who founded the Carl ' s Jr . chain in 1941 , will return to a company that has changed considerably since he was forced_out in late 1993 . In January , Karcher Enterprises acquired the right to open as_many as 300 Boston Chicken restaurants in Southern California . The holding company and the name change &quot; reflect the fact that we ' re more_than Carl ' s Jr . restaurants , &quot; Doyle said . &quot; We ' ve now got two businesses going. &quot; The proposed restructuring also is likely to change the makeup of Karcher Enterprises ' board of directors , though Foley would be chairman_of_the_board for the holding company . The company on Monday said it wants shareholders to approve a retirement policy that would force board_members to retire at age 70 . The age restriction won ' t apply to Karcher , 76 , whose family still holds 18 % of Karcher Enterprises ' outstanding shares . But the age policy would force longtime board_member Kenneth Olson , 74 , to retire . Olson , a retired president of the Vons Companies Inc. grocery_store chain , has been_on Karcher Enterprises ' board since 1980 . Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the restructuring during an annual meeting in June . Analysts said the restructuring evidently marks the end of a lengthy and highly public boardroom tiff that resulted in Karcher ' s dismissal and Foley ' s December election to the board . &quot; I can ' t say that I was surprised by any of it , &quot; Smith said . &quot; They have ambitious plans to roll_out the Boston Chicken stores , and they needed outside capital at some point to do that . &quot; As for the corporate name change , I honestly don ' t think it was meant to slight Carl Karcher , the person , &quot; Smith said . &quot; It ' s simply a change that reflects the true business of the company . Boston Chicken is going_to be a bigger and bigger part of Karcher Enterprises. &quot; Foley on Monday reiterated his support for a planned value menu that is designed to reverse a revenue slide that is hurting profitability . Doyle ' s team is developing a menu that ' s supposed to make the 350-unit chain more competitive with large national chains that correctly identified public demand for better food values . Doyle said it is imperative that the company be_better able to compete with other chains that earlier introduced value menus . &quot; We ' ve made great progress in improving our cost structure , &quot; Doyle said . &quot; But sales have not turned_around . . . . All of our research points to the fact that we get great marks for the quality of our products . . . but terrible in terms of_value for money . And we have to fix that ( so it ) makes us compelling to consumers and is profitable to us on the bottom line. &quot; Karcher Enterprises closed_down 1.25 cents on Monday at $ 13.25 in Nasdaq trading . New Parent for Carl ' s Jr . The creation of a new holding company for Carl Karcher Enterprises will be_on the agenda at this month ' s stockholder ' s meeting : * Name : CKE Restaurants Inc. * Holdings : Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. , operator of Carl ' s Jr . restaurants , and Boston Pacific Inc. , operator of planned Boston Chicken stores * Chairman : William P . Foley II * President / CEO : Donald E . Doyle Source : Carl Karcher Enterprises ; Researched by JANICE L .
