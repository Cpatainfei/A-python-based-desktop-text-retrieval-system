   <HEADLINE> NEW SALVO IN CUSTODY WARS ; COURTS : HOW MUCH CAN A SINGLE PARENT RELY ON DAY_CARE ? HOW IMPORTANT IS CARE FROM A FAMILY MEMBER ? A MICHIGAN CASE RAISES FEARS -- AND HACKLES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just about the only thing the parties in Ireland vs . Smith agree upon is that the case was never intended to be an indictment of day_care . What they were arguing about , Jennifer Ireland and Steven Smith say through their lawyers , was child_support and custody -- nothing more . But in ruling that 3-year-old Maranda Kate Ireland-Smith would be more likely to find &quot; security . . . a safe place . . . ( and ) permanency &quot; in the home of her father and paternal grandparents than in the day-care facility where she was sent by her college_student mother , a Michigan judge has unleashed a full-force tempest . Suddenly , the issues of single mothers who pursue their educations , children who are not &quot; raised and supervised by blood_relatives &quot; and &quot; child-parents &quot; -- unwed mothers and fathers who bring offspring into the world before they are themselves of majority age -- were under a microscope . &quot; The mother ' s academic pursuits , although laudable , are demanding , and in_order to complete her program it necessitates the leaving of the child for a considerable portion of its life in the care of strangers , &quot; Macomb County Circuit Court Judge Raymond Cashen wrote in explaining his decision to place Maranda in the custody of her 20-year-old father and his parents . Cashen ' s conclusions followed nine days of hearings initiated when Ireland sought child_support payments of $ 12 per week . Smith countersued , demanding custody of Maranda . It was the first_appearance in court for Ireland and Smith , who are not married and who grew_up in Mount Clemens , Mich. , a working-class community not far from Detroit . In an opinion released last week , the judge riled representatives from women ' s groups and child advocacy organizations when he added : &quot; There is no way that a single parent , attending an academic_program at an institution as prestigious as the University of Michigan , can do_justice to their studies and to the raising of an infant child. &quot; Legal experts also expressed reservations about the ruling . Kim Gandy , executive_vice_president of the National Organization for Women , called the decision shocking , adding : &quot; It puts women who are doing the very best they can do for their children into a lose-lose-lose situation. &quot; Leslie de Pietro , a counselor at the Family Resources Center at the University of Michigan , was equally appalled , asserting , &quot; To me the biggest irony in this case is that the judge is essentially saying to single mothers , ' stay_at home , go_on welfare , let the taxpayers support you and be that kind of role model. ' &quot; And Scott A . Altman , a family law professor at the University of Southern California , branded Cashen ' s action as &quot; just simple , plain , old-fashioned gender discrimination , &quot; where the prevailing view is that &quot; women should not be pursuing their education , and if they do , they should be punished. &quot; With 15 days before the ruling was to take_effect , 19-year-old Jennifer Ireland was in seclusion . Through her attorneys , who filed an emergency motion Monday , asking the Michigan Court of Appeals_to block the judge ' s order , she declined interview requests . But Smith , who lives with his parents while working part time in the local parks department and attending a community_college , said he was overjoyed by the decision . His only disappointment , Smith said by telephone from Mount Clemens , was that the wording of Cashen ' s opinion &quot; makes_it sound like a day-care issue , and it ' s not . There are many_more facets to this case than just day care. &quot; * The &quot; moral fitness &quot; of both parties was , for example , an area that Cashen dwelt on heavily in his ruling . The judge described Ireland as &quot; sexually indiscriminate as a young girl. &quot; Smith , Cashen said , &quot; wasn ' t much better &quot; -- adding that both parties &quot; had a great fetish for partying &quot; and that neither parent deserved &quot; medals for their youthful activities. &quot; Cashen also examined the consistency of Maranda ' s care to date , concluding that &quot; the maternal grandparent was the staying force in the early raising of the child. &quot; He also credited Ireland ' s mother with having provided the bulk of Maranda ' s financial_support since birth . He failed , however , to pay credence to allegations of domestic violence raised by Ireland against Smith . &quot; The parties in their youthful way apparently crashed or mauled one another , &quot; Cashen wrote . &quot; It is all superfluous. &quot; But while Cashen , who declined interview requests because he has jurisdiction over the case until Maranda is 18 , dismissed the domestic violence issue as &quot; not pertinent , &quot; Ireland ' s attorneys said the_matter would figure prominently in the appeal . No one disputed the basic facts of the case . Ireland was a 15-year-old high_school sophomore when she became pregnant . Smith , then a 16-year-old student at the same parochial_school , acknowledged paternity . They considered abortion , adoption and briefly had the child in foster care . Marriage was never an option . While her mother served as Maranda ' s primary caregiver , Ireland finished high_school as a cheerleader with a 4.0 grade point average . She earned a scholarship to the University of Michigan and moved to Ann Arbor . In Ireland ' s freshman year as a liberal arts major , Maranda spent about 35 hours per week in the care of Annette Johnson , a licensed child-care provider near the university campus . &quot; She ' s a sweet little_girl , &quot; Johnson said of the child . &quot; She ' s clean , she ' s neat , she ' s very cute -- and she ' s happy. &quot; As for the suggestion that Maranda might somehow have suffered from being shuffled between home care at Johnson ' s house and weekends and evenings with the Ireland or Smith families , Johnson said : &quot; That child is as far from neglected as I am from L.A. &quot; * But Cashen apparently thought otherwise . The 69-year-old judge called the day-care issue pivotal to his decision to award physical custody of Maranda to her father . &quot; Parents do raise children in a college setting , &quot; Cashen conceded , &quot; but it is hoped that the cooperation and the efforts of both parents negate parental neglect . The plaintiff ' s situation is entirely different , however , ( because ) she must rely_upon other people to take_care of this child while she is in class , and it is pretty clear that the demands of academia are such_that her time for her youngster would be circumscribed. &quot; Julie Field , an attorney at the University of Michigan ' s Women and the Law Clinic , who is leading the legal team representing Ireland ' s appeal , said the &quot; real problem &quot; is that &quot; the judge misunderstands what ' stability ' is and what ' the home ' is. &quot; To the judge , Field said , &quot; the home means you are in the same bedroom until you are 18 . To most people , home is an emotional attachment , and the people you are with , not a place. &quot; Although Cashen ' s opinion makes repeated reference_to the value of permanence and &quot; a regular home , &quot; Smith ' s attorney , Sharon Lee Edwards of Detroit , maintains that the case really centers around which parent is fit to care_for Maranda . She called Smith &quot; a young_man who changed , &quot; rising to the demands of single fatherhood when many young_men would rather be out partying . &quot; Who gives_a_hoot about day_care ? &quot; Edwards said . Her client has arranged his college schedule so that he takes classes just two days a week , Edwards said , and his parents have provided Maranda with a frilly pink-and-white bedroom . When Smith is in school or at_work , Edwards said , his mother will look_after Maranda . What happens if Smith marries or moves_out of the family home is anybody ' s guess , Julie Field said . Visitation by her client was also left unresolved in Cashen ' s opinion , as was the prospect that Ireland might be asked to pay child_support . Field declined to speculate on her client ' s chances for success on appeal , a process that could stretch_out indefinitely . Edwards thought her opponents did stand a chance of winning a stay of Cashen ' s custody order , but expressed confidence that her side would prevail on appeal . &quot; The case will be done on the evidence , &quot; said Edwards , who hailed the decision as the latest hallmark in the small but growing wave of men seeking physical custody of their children . &quot; There is no question of our losing the case. &quot; While Smith and his attorney described themselves as ecstatic over the decision , Field said Ireland is &quot; alternately stoic and devastated. &quot; Ireland , who says she hopes to be an international lawyer , is &quot; frustrated , and she ' s incredulous , &quot; Field said , &quot; but not really angry. &quot; Field said the case could serve as a precedent , helping to crystallize views about single mothers &quot; who are attacked when they attempt to better themselves -- and accordingly , their children. &quot; When the case goes_to appeal , Field said , &quot; it certainly will be an opportunity for the court to review day_care , and the realities of life in 1994. &quot;</TEXT>
