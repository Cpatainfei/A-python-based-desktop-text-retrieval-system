   <HEADLINE> SCIENCE MASTERS KILLER VIRUSES , DEBATES THEIR DISPOSAL ; MEDICINE : SMALLPOX HAS BEEN CONQUERED BY VACCINE . A FEW FROZEN VIRAL SAMPLES ARE ALL that ' s LEFT ON EARTH . SHOULD THEY BE PRESERVED OR DESTROYED ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here , in the bland buildings of the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention , is a murderers ' row of hundreds of killer viruses , guilty of uncounted millions of human_deaths over the ages . They languish in deep frozen sleep . But they pose a dilemma . What should science do with a killer virus when it has been rendered helpless ? Some call_for its execution . The instant culprit is smallpox , but there are others condemned to Death Row . Together , these tiny threadlike strands have ravaged the human_race from time unremembered , stifled human progress more_than all_the wars humans have waged upon each other . In the viral kitchens of CDC one need only add living cells , water and oxygen to the dried and frozen viruses to re-create their ancient lethal brews . The value of this catalogue of viruses is not questioned . In the recent outbreak of a mystery disease in the southwestern United States , the guilty agent was tracked_down , even though it was not considered one of the prime suspects , through the viral archives of CDC . One of the viruses on store here is what many consider the most lethal known to man . It is the Zairean strain of the Ebola virus , fetched from the sick and dying of Central_Africa . It is still active in the wild ; it can kill in days and spread faster than a California wildfire . The value of keeping the captive virus is not in_question . The value of captive smallpox_virus is . The World_Health_Organization proclaims the disease eradicated from the earth and calls_for destroying the virus . The few remaining samples are carefully stored in deep_freezes at this center and in Moscow . Scientists hope to decide their fate by this spring . Smallpox is the first killer virus to reach the status of dispensable . Polio is approaching that point . It has been wiped_out in the Western_Hemisphere and faces the same fate elsewhere on earth before the century is out . Smallpox poses a unique predicament . Incinerate it , or keep it against an unforeseen recurrence , for further study , or just as a reminder of the unkind side of Mother Nature . The ethics may be easier with nuclear_warheads and poison_gases . Viruses are tougher . In 1967 when the World Health Assembly resolved to wipe_out smallpox with the use of an effective vaccine and concentrated public health measures , more_than 40 countries were still fighting the disease within their borders . Ten years later the last natural case was recorded in Somalia . In the waning months of the disease , there was a $ 1 # 000 reward posted for information leading to any case of the disease . Humankind is the only natural reservoir for the variola virus which causes smallpox . Likewise , polio . But even on the ropes , variola , transmitted mostly through the air , is an insidious enemy . Dr. Brian Mahy , director of the division of viral and rickettsial_diseases at CDC , outlined some slip-ups along the way . &quot; In 1973 , a vaccinated woman who had observed egg inoculation with variola virus at the London School of Hygiene became ill , and before her smallpox was correctly diagnosed she infected another patient at the hospital . Two persons who visited the secondary case subsequently contracted smallpox and died . &quot; A worse tragedy occurred in 1978 at Birmingham University ( a year after the virus was adjudged eradicated in the wild ) where a 40-year-old photographer became infected with the Abid strain of variola virus that had apparently leaked through a service duct from a laboratory where experimental research on the virus was being carried_out . Filled with remorse , the poxvirologist who was head of the laboratory took his own life a_few days before the photographer herself died of smallpox . &quot; Although vaccination of persons believed to be at risk successfully contained a potential outbreak of the disease , the photographer ' s 70-year-old mother also became infected , even though she had been previously vaccinated . She was the last person to replicate variola virus , and fortunately she survived. &quot; Dr. Mahy , who has encouraged debate on the question of smallpox destruction , has himself voted for it . In sum , the argument is that the agent is too deadly to be tolerated and once the genetic sequence of the virus is documented there is no further need for it . Prof . Colin Howard , head of pathology and infectious_diseases at the Royal Veterinary College , London , said there is still much work to be done . Not all_of variola ' s secrets are known . He asks what Edward Jenner , the 18th-Century English physician who discovered the original smallpox vaccine , would say . &quot; I am sure Jenner ' s natural curiosity would have exceeded his desire to accede_to popular opinion. &quot; Besides , if danger is measured by virulence alone , then what of other more virulent viruses ? &quot; Are we to destroy stocks of all pathogens once they are eliminated ? &quot; Howard asks . Even when the smallpox genetics are completely known , it will be very difficult to synthesize the virus again , so once gone , all gone . Scientists know the genetics of the maverick that is the Ebola virus . It kills 88 % of the people it infects , as opposed to 40 % in the most severe outbreaks of smallpox . The difference is science has a very effective vaccine against smallpox . &quot; In the case of a virus like Ebola , &quot; said Mahy , &quot; we have absolutely no vaccine , no treatment . . . . We don ' t know where it comes from . Despite an enormous amount of investigation , it ' s never been determined where this virus resides . Fortunately or unfortunately , it ' s a virus that has only occurred in a_couple_of isolated epidemics. &quot; Scientists here have shown in laboratory work that the virus is &quot; absolutely lethal &quot; to non-human primates , but nothing else is sure except that 274 people died_out of just over 300 infected in one outbreak in the late 1970s in Zaire . The Ebola work is curtailed , said Mahy , because of the crisis in the southwest , in which CDC scientists in the Special Pathogens Division were able to pin to a most unlikely virus . Special Pathogens deals with all sorts of organisms which require the most stringent laboratory safety procedures , and this crosses all types of viruses . It studies a flock of viruses besides Ebola which kills in four or five days but may appear to be quicker -- two days from the onset of symptoms . It also studies the Lhasa virus which kills up_to 50 % of those hospitalized within 14 days . In 1990 there was a Lhasa fever case in Chicago , when a man came_home to his father ' s funeral , became sick and died within 48 hours , but not before his mother and sister were infected and also died . Isolation was the only weapon public health doctors had to confine the disease . But the major mandate at CDC is to be the barrier between the world ' s killing stock and the U.S. citizen . Viruses are known tricksters . The influenza viruses , for instance , are in constant change . And last spring nobody knew what it was that began striking down people in the American Southwest until CDC went_back to its biological laboratory and sent its detectives into the wild . It became &quot; an interesting opportunity , &quot; said Dr , Thomas Ksiazek , chief of diagnostics for Special Pathogens . &quot; This could be held_up as an example of how modern science can be brought_to_bear in a rapid way on what appears to be a new problem . Cases didn ' t appear until early to mid-May when the state health department in New Mexico was notified . They looked in vain for a match with standard respiratory pathogens known to attack the lower respiratory_tract . CDC was called_in by May 23 . Epidemiologists were sent to New Mexico to document the pattern of the disease . How many cases were there ? When ? Where ? Were they all_of one particular form ? They used statistical techniques to try to pinpoint the most likely causes of the disease . When biological samples became available , they were sent to Atlanta where specialists in all_the pathogens were alerted . Around the Memorial_Day weekend , Special Pathogens began dividing up the specimens between scientists schooled in bacterial diseases , rickettsial_diseases , viral diseases , parasitic diseases and possible environmental contaminants . No one knew what they were looking_for , least of all_the virologists . There were 25 or 30 probabilities , hundreds of possibilities . &quot; Quite frankly the Hanta virus was the furthest thing from our minds , &quot; said Tsiazek . Dr. Tsiazek and Dr. Pierre Rollin , a French physician working as chief of the pathogenesis section , sifted through about 40 specimens on a weekend and found antibodies to the Hanta virus in about a third . &quot; This was the first indication that we might be close , &quot; said Rollin . The Hanta viruses came_to U.S. attention during the Korean_War , when up_to 3 # 000 United Nations troops were stricken . Early the virus claimed 15 out of 100 of its victims , although as doctors came_to know it better the mortality_rate went_down to 5 % or 6 % . Since , it has been found around the globe from China to Scandinavia and the major port cities of the United States . Knowing that Hanta viruses were carried by rodent feces , two scientists drew traps from the CDC stores and went_to the scene . From the specimens they shipped back to Atlanta it looked_like the deer_mouse was carrying a Hanta virus . Still , the known forms of Hanta killed by acute_renal_failure . The New Mexico agent killed by respiratory failure . The Special Pathogens branch needed more proof . That fell to Dr. Stuart Nichol , who began a detailed probe . He used genetic detection techniques on autopsy materials and rodent feces , pulling_up genetic pieces , sequencing them for comparison . They were the same as the virus in humans . &quot; So now we knew we were dealing with a newly recognized virus and a newly recognized disease , &quot; Nichol said . The difference was that the old virus destroyed the capillaries in the kidney , and the new one attacks the capillaries in the lungs , drowning its victims in their own fluids . &quot; It took one to two weeks to get really conclusive evidence from serology and from genetic approaches , &quot; said Tsiazek . &quot; In the old days , without all_the modern technology , it would take months or years to identify the etiologic agent in a newly emerged disease . And yet here we were in a matter of days actually with an agent nobody suspected. &quot; Most viral detective_work never ends . Influenza is a case_in_point . In World_War I influenza killed almost as_many people , give or take a_few million , as died in World_War_II , the world ' s bloodiest war . That virus and its sisters and brothers haunt the Earth today . It is a virus with an incredible ability to change_form and dodge the vaccines prepared against it . There is a widespread reservoir of the disease , not the least of which are the ducks and pigs of China where the virus is alive and well . &quot; Viruses are not in themselves replicating organisms , &quot; said Tsiazek . &quot; They are the ultimate parasite . They require a living animal cell that is of the right type to provide all_of the machinery to replicate their genetic message . If you remove them from that environment where they don ' t have living cells , you must keep them very very cold or by some_other means , like freeze-drying , remove all_of the water and oxygen so that no chemistry is going on. &quot; Consequently , there is a large library of flu viruses at CDC , and because of a virus ' ability to mutate or reassort itself , the library grows every year . The main flus on file are the Swine flu , the Hong Kong flu and Influenza B . On the basis of reports from the field , the CDC prepares a new formula for its vaccine of the year . There is a worldwide reporting system for influenza . Meantime , the scientists at CDC keep_up their relentless search for answers to hepatitis , HIV , herpes , the more well-known viral entities , as well as the nature of parasitism and infection . Dr. Joseph McDade , associate director for Laboratory Sciences , said nature ' s really successful parasites are very clever . Some , like malaria , that cause persistent infections in people , mutate and change even while in the body . The body develops resistance to the first invader but misses the mutants that follow . &quot; You have to think_about it as a universe . These microorganisms have been with us hundreds of thousands of years . As long as there have been people and primates they have been there . And they know how to make a living and live well . What they try to do actually is live at the expense of their host without killing him . So that disease and especially fatal disease is a failure of the microorganism because it is killing its host. &quot;</TEXT>
