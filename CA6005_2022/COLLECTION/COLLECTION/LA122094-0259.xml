   <HEADLINE> EPA OKS CLEAN-CAR PLAN FOR NORTHEAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As expected , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday approved a fiercely debated proposal by a dozen Eastern states and the District_of_Columbia to use a low-emissions vehicle plan based on California ' s stringent program . Auto_makers have opposed the plan , and EPA Administrator Carol Browner said her agency would continue to work for a compromise among state regulators , environmentalists and the Big Three car_makers . Like California , the states are required by the federal Clean Air Act to forge plans to lower air pollutants in the broad air basin shared by members of the Ozone Transport Commission . The commission includes Connecticut , Delaware , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , Virginia and Washington , D.C. California proponents of alternative-fuel vehicles , particularly electric_cars , have been keenly interested in the outcome of the debate because extension of the California plan to the commission states could spread the California mandate to 40 % of the U.S. auto market . The commission_plan does not necessarily require electric vehicles , although New York and Massachusetts have separately passed laws mandating zero-emissions vehicles -- almost certainly electric_cars , considering the state of current technologies . Auto_makers have opposed the proposal , arguing that it would make them produce a third category of cars in addition to conventional vehicles and cars for the California market . Many state regulators and environmentalists say they can ' t cut pollution enough without a California-style plan . On Monday , proponents praised the decision by the EPA . But hoping to avoid delays from lawsuits from both auto_makers and environmentalists , Browner also announced Monday that efforts would continue to find a compromise &quot; 49-state car , &quot; both for Ozone Transport states and all other states besides California . &quot; The broader plan still being discussed by all parties would be more cost effective and would benefit public health across the country , &quot; Browner said .</TEXT>
