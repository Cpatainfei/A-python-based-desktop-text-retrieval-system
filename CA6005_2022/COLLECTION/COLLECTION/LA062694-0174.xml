   <HEADLINE> SEASONAL FRUIT ; THE BERRIES OF SUMMER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> School is out for the summer and strawberries signal the beginning of berry season . I pack a picnic lunch , load my family in the car and head for the you-pick fields . I caution everyone not to pick as_many berries as last year , reminding them how long it took me to clean and make jam out of last year ' s batch . I say this every year , and every year when we reach the fields , the berries are such a bright red and so good to eat that we end_up picking more_than we can possibly eat_in a year ' s time . Two hours later we carry our berry flats to the weighing stand , pay_up and drive_off . Dusty and berry-stained , we head for our favorite picnic spot to stretch_out on the grass . Those berries not already eaten are tucked_away in the coolers . When we arrive home_in the evening , everyone disappears while I begin to sort and clean the berries . I slice them for freezing , and with the others I make jam , alternatively tossing one in the pot , one in my mouth . The doors are open , the kitchen is warm and sticky and the baseball_game is_on . As midnight approaches , I promise myself that next year we won ' t pick so many berries . Bowls of berries , baskets of berries , fields of berries -- the summer brings us a bounty of berries and happily we eat them all . We eat them fresh or cook them into pies , cobblers and jams . They are intertwined with memories and occasions throughout the summer : Fourth_of_July means strawberry shortcake , Labor_Day brings blueberry cobbler , and birthdays and gatherings in between mean lots of berry pies . My best_friend ' s father loved to pick wild blackberries . It was his hobby and he took it quite seriously , even though the season lasted only two to three weeks . He had a favorite patch , though he never told anyone where it was . He would take a clean two-pound shortening can , punch two holes in it and attach a wire handle . He ' d set_out in the morning to patiently gather enough of these jewel-like berries to make a pie . Back at the house he would oversee the cleaning of the berries , coaching his young daughter all_the while , &quot; Just a slight drizzle of water when you wash -- if you use too_much you ' ll wash_away the juice. &quot; Patiently the stems were removed , each berry picked clean , and then it would be time to make a pie . His rules for the pie were few but strict : Never use too_much flour and never serve it with ice_cream . He was a purist . There is evidence that berries were eaten and savored as long ago as 5000 B.C. By the early 17th Century , berries were cultivated in kitchen_gardens in England . Strawberries , in particular , were a favorite subject of European artists , who painted them bright red , plump and ready to eat . In the New World , the variety of wild berries available delighted the early settlers . They found wild_strawberries , blueberries , blackberries , gooseberries and cranberries , which they ate both fresh and cooked . The Native_Americans taught them how to preserve them by drying them in the sun . High in vitamins and minerals , berries became an important part of their diet . The invention of canning early in the 19th Century led to the gradual near-elimination of the local growers markets . Farmers could now grow berries in larger quantities for people who could preserve ( rather than immediately have to consume ) them . The development of the railroads further aided the growth of the commercial berry market . Once limited to selling their goods near where they lived , farmers were now able to ship larger quantities across greater distances . It was also around this time that plant breeders and botanists began hybridizing new varieties of cultivated berries , improving the size and quality , making them better suited for growing on a commercial scale . The Gold_Rush of 1849 expanded the commercial berry business further . As huge numbers of pioneers flooded the West , horticultural centers_on the northern and central coasts of California were established . Later , when the population migrated into the Pacific Northwest , the Willamette Valley in Oregon became a central growing region for strawberries , blackberries , raspberries , gooseberries and currants . These Western regions -- Hood River , Ore. , and Watsonville , Calif. , in particular -- continue to produce some of the finest berries . Today , we enjoy a wide choice of beautiful berries . Although berries grow best in certain regions in the United States , thanks to refrigerated shipping they can be enjoyed all around the country . In the summer , you can gather berries from your own garden , seek_out the nearest you-pick farm , visit a nearby farmers market or fill your basket at your own secret berry patch . * This patriotic dessert is beautiful and luscious , celebrating summer in all its glory .
