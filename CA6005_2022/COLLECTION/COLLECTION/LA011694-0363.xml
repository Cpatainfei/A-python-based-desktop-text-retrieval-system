   <HEADLINE> HUBBLE : FROM FIASCO TO SUBLIME ; AFTER A TITANIC STRUGGLE , THERE ' S A MARVELOUS WINDOW ON THE UNIVERSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has taken a while and cost a bundle , but the Hubble Space Telescope appears finally to be peering sharply into some of the far reaches of the universe and producing images of truly remarkable clarity , just as it was designed to do . Indeed , says Daniel S . Goldin , the administrator of NASA , &quot; the spacecraft is operating beyond our ambition. &quot; While a lot more testing of the $ 1.5-billion orbiting telescope is still to be done , astronomers are excited by the early signs of success . The shame is that the Hubble wasn ' t in the same condition when it was launched nearly four years ago . NASA thought it had a winner then , too . But two months after the launching , NASA had to admit that the telescope ' s 94.5-inch-diameter mirror had been improperly ground at the edges , a flaw that surely should have been found and rectified on the ground . It took the skills of seven astronauts aboard the space shuttle Endeavor to correct the Hubble ' s problems . Their tricky , $ 629-million rescue mission last month was a feat in itself , and it ' s a credit to those who designed and carried it out that it seems to have succeeded so well . An orbiting observatory gets_around the problem of atmospheric interference that Earth-based telescopes confront , making more detailed images of outer space possible . The Hubble , even in its flawed state , was able to send_back images that could be strikingly enhanced by computers on the ground , but the sharper focus it ' s now expected to have will lead , Goldin promises , to discoveries that until now were beyond reach . One of its key objectives will be to search for black_holes , those theoretical points in the universe that are believed to be the remains of ancient stars that have collapsed into themselves , reducing enormous objects to diameters of perhaps only a_few miles . A black_hole , it ' s hypothesized , consists_of matter so dense and thus of such powerful gravitational_force that whatever is nearby , including other stars , is drawn into its center . Since not even light can escape_from the gravitational grip of a black_hole , its existence can only be inferred . The Hubble , among its other potential achievements , might finally provide the means for proving that these fascinating objects are in fact out there . Knowledge of the universe may at this moment stand on the threshold of a great expansion .</TEXT>
