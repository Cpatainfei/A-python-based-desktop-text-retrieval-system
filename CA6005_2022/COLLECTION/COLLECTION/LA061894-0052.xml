   <HEADLINE> HILL GOES INTO SECLUSION AFTER CONVICTION ; LEGISLATURE : THE WHITTIER SENATOR IS EXPECTED TO RESIGN HIS SEAT BUT COULD BE EXPELLED FROM SENATE IF HE DOES NOT . HE WAS FOUND GUILTY ON POLITICAL CORRUPTION CHARGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State Sen . Frank Hill of Whittier , found guilty of political corruption charges , disappeared from public view Friday amid speculation over whether he would voluntarily resign or face potential expulsion . Aides to the veteran Republican lawmaker said they did not know his whereabouts but believed that he had gone_into seclusion with his wife and children in Southern California . Other legislators , who rarely shrink_from offering observations on virtually any issue , refused to discuss Hill ' s situation , although expectations in the Capitol were that he would resign soon . Hill , 40 , was convicted Thursday of using his office as a member of the Assembly in 1988 to extort $ 2 # 500 from an FBI_agent posing as a businessman in an FBI investigation of political corruption in the Capitol . He faces a prison sentence that could exceed six years . Attention swung Friday to the nature and timing of Hill ' s expected resignation from the San Gabriel Valley seat he has held since 1990 . Under the law , Gov . Pete Wilson has 14 days after a vacancy occurs to call a special election . Senate Leader Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) said through spokeswoman Karen Caves that he was consulting other members of the Senate Rules Committee and the Legislature ' s lawyer on what courses of action may be available to the Senate and Hill . It was learned that Lockyer and Hill , a popular and affable legislator , had spoken by telephone Thursday night but neither could be reached for comment about what was said . Separately , a highly placed source suggested that Hill may have the option of delaying his resignation until he is sentenced Sept . 12 . Unlike other elected state officials , legislators are not required to surrender their offices upon conviction . The state Constitution empowers the Assembly and Senate to determine the suitability of their members and provides_for expulsion of a member by a two-thirds vote . Speaking on the condition of anonymity , the source said there was speculation that Hill , whose legal bills are expected to exceed $ 1 million , may want to keep his seat and remain on the payroll until he is sentenced . &quot; It is a sticky issue , &quot; the source said . &quot; Everyone likes Frank. &quot; According to the source , &quot; one argument runs , if he decides to appeal ( the conviction ) , should he be forced_out ? The counter-argument is , should a convicted felon be voting on bills ? &quot; A third option is for Hill to keep his seat until he is sentenced but forgo voting and participating in other official actions of the Senate , the source said . One member of the Rules Committee , Sen . William Craven ( R-Oceanside ) said he does not know how he will vote if the issue comes_before the committee . He said a &quot; compassionate person &quot; could make a case for delaying a resignation until sentencing , but &quot; I think ( citizens ) would say that is wrong. &quot; Recent history suggests that the Senate wants a quick resignation . In 1990 , state Sen . Joseph B . Montoya ( D-Whittier ) became the first sitting legislator to be convicted in the federal investigation of political corruption in the Capitol . Three days later , the Rules Committee stripped him of his committee chairmanships and threatened to start expulsion proceedings unless he stepped_down swiftly . He did so within three days . The last expulsion from the Senate occurred in 1905 when two Republicans and two Democrats were ousted as a result of a criminal scandal .</TEXT>
