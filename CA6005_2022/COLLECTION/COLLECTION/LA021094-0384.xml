   <HEADLINE> THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS ; WHEN RULES WERE MADE TO BE BROKEN ; FOREIGN FILMS : FOR THIS YEAR ' S NOMINEES , THE ACADEMY RELAXED ITS STIPULATION THAT AT LEAST HALF THE CREATIVE TEAM SHOULD COME FROM THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three films nominated by Asian_countries dominated the academy ' s foreign-language category Wednesday , and none of them would have been eligible for consideration had the organization not decided to bend its new guidelines this year . One of the nominees -- Taiwan ' s &quot; The Wedding Banquet &quot; -- was shot in New York by a New York director and crew . Vietnam ' s &quot; The Scent of Green Papaya &quot; was filmed on a French sound stage . The controversial &quot; Farewell My Concubine &quot; was not nominated by China , where it was filmed , but by Hong Kong , where it was financed . In all three cases , the academy had to relax its stipulation that at least half the creative team should come from the country_of_origin . The selections were rife_with other paradoxes . &quot; Belle Epoque , &quot; a comedy set_in 1930 and centered around a young_man ' s pursuit of four sisters , is Spanish despite its French title . &quot; ' Belle Epoque ' has the flavor of a lost paradise , something in the past that you ' d like to revisit , &quot; said director Fernando Trueba , adding that the film is a homage to French director Jean Renoir . The mostly English-speaking United Kingdom was represented among the foreign-language nominees with a Welsh film , &quot; Hedd Wyn , &quot; directed by Paul Turner . A World_War I drama , the movie is the only one among the five that has yet to find a U.S. distributor . Tom Rothman , president of worldwide production for the Samuel Goldwyn Co. , distributor of &quot; The Wedding Banquet , &quot; said the strong showing by Asian films is not a fluke . &quot; We ' re seeing a flowering of Asian cinema , &quot; he said . &quot; It represents a growth , not just in movie making opportunities but in the receptivity of American audiences to those pictures. &quot; Later this year , Goldwyn will release &quot; Eat Drink Man Woman , &quot; the next film from Ang Lee , director of &quot; Wedding Banquet , &quot; and &quot; To Live , &quot; a new film from Zhang Yimou , a two-time previous Oscar nominee . Said &quot; Farewell My Concubine &quot; director Chen Kaige in a statement : &quot; I ' m so pleased that three of the five nominees in my category are directed by Asian filmmakers. &quot; In another unusual development , two of the nominated films center around homosexual characters . &quot; The Wedding Banquet , &quot; the top-grossing film in Taiwan ' s history , tells the story of a gay_man who marries his female tenant in_order to hide his homosexuality from his visiting parents . The epic &quot; Farewell My Concubine , &quot; based on a Hong Kong book , traces the 50-year relationship between two male Peking Opera_stars . Rothman said the gay themes are a further sign of the maturing cinema in what are &quot; traditionally thought_of as very restrictive societies. &quot; Traditional Vietnamese culture is the subject of &quot; Papaya , &quot; that country ' s first Oscar entry . Set_in the 1950s , the movie was shot outside Paris because there is virtually no film_industry in Vietnam .</TEXT>
