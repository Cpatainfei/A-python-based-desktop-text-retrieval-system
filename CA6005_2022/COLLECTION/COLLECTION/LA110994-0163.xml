   <HEADLINE> REPUBLICANS ' RISING TIDE SPILLS_OVER INTO STATEHOUSES ; POLITICS : GOP LOOKS VIRTUALLY CERTAIN TO CONTROL MAJORITY OF GOVERNORSHIPS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1970 . DEMOCRATS LOSE TENNESSEE , OKLAHOMA AND KANSAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Democrats ' Debacle ' 94 extended_to statehouses across the nation Tuesday as Republicans appeared virtually certain to control a majority of governorships for the first time since 1970 . Republicans seized Democratic-held governorships in Tennessee , Oklahoma , Kansas and Wyoming and were in position to seize statehouses in Texas and Pennsylvania . The GOP seemed certain to hold the electoral-vote-rich states of California , Illinois , Michigan , Wisconsin , Ohio and Minnesota . The gains , coupled with the expected reelections of many of their sitting governors , is likely to give the Republicans an opportunity to advance their tax-slashing , welfare-cutting , crime-throttling agenda in state capitols in the next two years . With the looming prospect of sclerosis in Washington , the states will become increasingly important as laboratories of social and fiscal_policy , as popular Republican incumbents and energetic newcomers try to make_good on conservative campaign pledges . In Kansas , GOP Secretary_of_State Bill Graves defeated Rep . Jim Slattery ; in Oklahoma , former U.S. Atty . Frank Keating defeated Democratic Lt . Gov . Jack Mildren ; in Tennessee , Rep . Don Sundquist defeated Nashville Mayor Phil Bredesen and , in Wyoming , GOP state Sen . Jim Geringer defeated Democratic Secretary_of_State Kathy Karpan . In Texas , Ann Richards appeared to be headed for defeat at the hands of businessman George W . Bush , son of the former President , despite her personal popularity and her matchless campaign style . Anti-incumbent fever , paired with deep disenchantment with President Clinton and Democratic Party policies , appeared to be too_much for her to overcome . Richards also suffered from a huge gender gap in the voting : Women supported Richards by 53 % to 47 % , while male voters backed Bush by 57 % to 47 % . As in Senate contests across the nation , Republican gubernatorial candidates tarred their Democratic opponents as allies of the President who espoused outdated Clinton-style liberal policies . While crime_rates are declining nationally , anti-crime rhetoric was off the charts in virtually every gubernatorial campaign . The GOP ' s statehouse gains promise to play a role in presidential politics in 1996 , giving Republicans an organizational and fund-raising advantage in critical regions , while burnishing the presidential or vice-presidential prospects of Pete Wilson of California , William F . Weld of Massachusetts , George_V . Voinovich of Ohio , John Engler of Michigan and some newer faces . The Democrats ' brightest spot appeared to be Florida , where 64-year-old incumbent Lawton Chiles was fighting_back against a furious challenge by real_estate developer Jeb Bush , another son of the former President . The race , like many others across the nation , turned_on the question of who was toughest on crime , with Bush accusing Chiles of being insufficiently energetic in his advocacy of the death_penalty . Georgia was the scene of another closely watched race . Democratic incumbent Zell Miller was identified by his opponent , businessman Guy Millner , as a virtual clone of the President , who is deeply unpopular in Georgia and throughout the South . Miller , who gave a nominating speech for Clinton at the Democrats ' 1992 convention , moved as far to the right as he could , all but repudiating his support for Clinton and sounding every inch a Republican as he fought to save his job . Democratic officials acknowledged that they had been swamped by a Republican and anti-incumbent tide but attributed some of their losses to population_shifts in the South and Southwest . &quot; I think in the Southern races there ' s been a demographic trend over 10 to 20 years , a changing nature of the electorate as retirees from the Midwest move down . The region has become much more competitive than it ever was . It ' s not like the old days when Democrats had a lock , &quot; said Doug Richardson , chairman of the Democratic Governors Assn . He also cited the deep animosity toward career politicians in the close races in New York , New Mexico and Iowa . Twelve-year Democratic incumbents Mario M . Cuomo in New York and Bruce King in New Mexico , and Republican Terry Branstad in Iowa were in the fights of their political lives . &quot; Long-term incumbents face a more difficult test with each subsequent election , &quot; Richardson said . &quot; The bar keeps getting raised before the voters let you go_on . It ' s a natural phenomenon. &quot; In Pennsylvania , Republican Rep . Tom Ridge was in position to upset Democratic Lt . Gov . Mark Singel , using crime as a cudgel . Singel struggled after the revelation that as head of the state Board of Pardons he recommended parole for a prisoner who is now charged with rape and murder . Regional concerns drove many of the races , with Republican incumbents in the Midwest benefiting from strong economies and Democratic officeholders in the West suffering from the unpopularity of Clinton ' s land-use policies . The big winners were Republican incumbents in the Midwest : Ohio ' s Voinovich , Engler of Michigan , Jim Edgar of Illinois , Tommy G . Thompson of Wisconsin and Arne Carlson of Minnesota . All ran_on pledges of fiscal conservatism and toughness on crime and are likely to play a role in GOP presidential politics in years to come . One of the few Republican incumbent governors who faced a tough challenge was Fife Symington of Arizona , who faced charges of involvement in a failed savings and loan . His opponent , grocery chain owner Eddie Basha , saw a large lead evaporate , and the race went_down to the wire . Symington , 49 , a conservative developer who wants to repeal the state ' s personal_income tax and create prison chain_gangs , attributed his recent surge in the polls to a strong showing in public_debates and TV attack ads that portrayed Basha as a &quot; tax-and-spend liberal &quot; who is soft_on crime . In New Mexico , a third-party candidate could spoil the reelection hopes of King , a 70-year-old Democrat and rancher who was facing a photo finish against Republican newcomer and contractor Gary Johnson . Colorado Gov . Roy Romer appeared headed for easy victory over his Republican rival , millionaire oilman Bruce Benson . A largely civil campaign dissolved when revelations about Benson ' s drunk-driving arrests and acrimonious divorce put him on the defensive . In Colorado ' s meanest and most costly political race ever , Benson , 56 , who has invested $ 3.5 million of_his_own money into his effort , ran a campaign largely based on such national GOP issues as tax cuts , welfare reform and crime . Times staff writer Louis Sahagun in Denver , researcher Lianne Hart in Austin , Tex. , and special correspondent Mike Clary in Miami contributed to this story .</TEXT>
