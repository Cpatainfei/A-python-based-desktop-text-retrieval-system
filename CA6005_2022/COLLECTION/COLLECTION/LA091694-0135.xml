   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA ' S NEW REVOLUTION : LIBEL SUITS ; LITIGATION : POLITICAL BAD BOY VLADIMIR V . ZHIRINOVSKY WINS AN AWARD FOR BEING CALLED A ' FASCIST. ' OTHERS ARE TAKING THEIR FIGHTS OUT OF THE STREETS AND INTO THE COURTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A year after President Boris N . Yeltsin dissolved Parliament , triggering a bloody revolt that left 143 people dead , the libel suit has replaced the Kalashnikov rifle as the chief instrument of political struggle in Russia . On Thursday , ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky won a libel suit against Yegor T . Gaidar , the architect of Yeltsin ' s free-market economic reforms , who had called Zhirinovsky &quot; the most popular fascist &quot; in Russia . After reviewing evidence that included Adolf Hitler ' s &quot; Mein Kampf , &quot; Zhirinovsky ' s book , &quot; The Last Dash South , &quot; and the Encyclopedia of Philosophy , a Moscow municipal court ruled that Zhirinovsky had been wronged . The three judges ordered Gaidar and his publisher , the newspaper Izvestia , to pay 1 million rubles in damages . The award was worth $ 435 at Thursday ' s exchange_rate . In another courtroom on the other side of Moscow , a leader of the old Parliament also won a minor victory Thursday in a libel suit against his old enemy , Yeltsin . In the English- and French-language editions of his new biography , &quot; The Struggle for Russia , &quot; Yeltsin writes that the &quot; fascist &quot; Iona I . Andronov would likely have been appointed foreign_minister had the October , 1993 , uprising by hard-liners succeeded . Russia has not forgotten the 20 million or more Soviet citizens who perished during World_War_II , and calling someone a fascist here is like branding him a Nazi . Andronov , who lost much of his family to starvation during the Nazi siege of Leningrad , immediately filed suit against Yeltsin and his three Western publishers , including Random House . &quot; For my whole life , fascists have meant scum to me , &quot; he said . &quot; There can be no worse insult. &quot; The British publisher Harper Collins has already apologized to Andronov and promised to correct the error in future editions , according to a letter Andronov said he received from the publisher ' s solicitors . In the Russian edition of the memoirs , Andronov is described as a &quot; militarist. &quot; On Thursday , the 60-year-old former foreign correspondent marched_out of a courthouse on Partisan Street in Kuntsevo , the district in western Moscow where Yeltsin lives , with a summons for the president or his representatives to appear in court . If Yeltsin fails to show_up , Andronov said , it will mean &quot; he is not only a slanderer , but a coward as well. &quot; The president ' s press service had no comment on the lawsuit . That Russia ' s vitriolic ideological battles are being waged in court instead of on the streets represents a great leap forward from a year ago , when mobs of nationalists and Communists brawled with riot police , and Yeltsin sent tanks to bombard the White_House Parliament building . Today , Yeltsin is_on cordial terms with the new Parliament elected nine months ago , and the crowds that gather on Moscow streets are there to buy and sell stock shares . The Russian economy , though frighteningly feeble , appears to be stabilizing . Inflation was 4.1 % in August , the lowest rate since reforms began in 1992 . And the average Russian monthly wage jumped to about $ 116 , a 46 % increase since June . Yet many Russians remain disillusioned with Yeltsin for using tanks to fight his political battles , and disgusted at their government ' s seeming inability to curb crime , corruption and the growing inequality between rich and poor . The malaise is evident in recent public_opinion_polls , such_as a Vesti television survey that found that only 19 % of respondents considered Russia ' s leaders to be democrats . Still , no Soviet leader would have allowed a political enemy to drag him into court . Now political foes of all stripes are routinely resorting_to lawsuits to defend their honor . It is not hard to win , as the burden_of_proof is_on the defendant . For example , the mayor of Moscow , Yuri M . Lushkov , won a slander suit last year against former Soviet leader Mikhail S . Gorbachev , who had said city officials were building themselves dachas with public funds . Gorbachev could not furnish proof of Lushkov ' s alleged corruption , and he lost . He was ordered to apologize and fined the equivalent of 3 cents for failure to show_up in court . Lushkov won at least eight other libel suits last year . In the Zhirinovsky case , the court found that Gaidar had not managed to prove that the bad boy of Russian politics was really &quot; the most popular fascist &quot; in the land . The three-judge panel rejected a last-minute attempt to introduce Zhirinovksy ' s statements about Hitler into evidence . The court found that Zhirinovsky , leader of the largest party in the Russian Duma , the lower house of Parliament , had suffered &quot; moral damage &quot; as a result of Gaidar ' s article , an analysis of Zhirinovsky ' s ideology that was published in May . Izvestia was also ordered to print a retraction . Gaidar ' s lawyer , Genry Reznik , said he would appeal the decision .</TEXT>
