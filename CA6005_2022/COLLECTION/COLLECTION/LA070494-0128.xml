   <HEADLINE> BATTERED WOMEN DISCOVER LEAVING IS NO SIMPLE TASK ; ABUSE : LACK OF MONEY OR SHELTER STOPS MANY . FEAR OF MORE VIOLENCE HOLDS_BACK OTHERS . AND SOME STAY FOR LOVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The woman leafs through cards and letters , mementos of a life that very nearly killed her . She picks one up and reads from it , and her face glows bright with remembered love and comfort . It is 1978 again ; she is a newlywed , and beloved . The letter was written by her husband eight weeks after they took their vows -- but before the rape , the death threats , the bruises that would follow , the head smashed on the bathroom tiles , the suicide attempts , the therapy bills . Before the despair . &quot; I am really free , free to be happy , &quot; he wrote . &quot; You are the most wonderful thing in my life and you are there forever . I love you , Monkey Girl. &quot; The notes were_on the pillow in the morning , in Kat ' s luggage when she traveled . They reeled her in . They kept her close . When they no longer worked , her husband beat her until she could not leave . Six years later , after trying several times to leave , Kat was finally gone_for good . Why did she stay so_long ? &quot; I loved him with all my heart , &quot; she says . &quot; Part of the coming_back was that he ' d woo me back . Part of it was that he ' d threaten me. &quot; In the complex calculus that is domestic violence , there is no single answer to the abiding question , tinged with blame and threaded through_with doubt : Why does a woman stay ? For some , the answer is as simple as love ; for others , as fundamental as money . It is as old as religion and as paralyzing as fear . It is hope and optimism , shame , guilt and the children . It is all_of these things put_together . For some , it is the lack of opportunity : &quot; The reason I didn ' t leave him before was that I didn ' t know there were shelters , &quot; says Dianne , who is currently in hiding at a San Fernando Valley safe house . &quot; I had nowhere to go. &quot; Simply knowing about shelters is not enough to push a woman from peril to protection . There are but 290 shelter beds in all_of Los Angeles County -- an area where law_enforcement agencies received more_than 67 # 000 domestic violence calls_in 1993 . Another 250 beds_cover the rest of the region from Bakersfield to the Mexican border -- an area that recorded nearly 50 # 000 such calls_in the same year . Most shelters do not take women in on weekends or in the evening . Most do not allow male_children over the age of 12 . Most cannot accommodate women with disabilities . Most offer little bilingual assistance . Most require women to quit their jobs , pull their children out of school , make_sure that the men who hurt them do not follow them back . Shelter life is harsh , but these rare beds are rarely empty . &quot; The question ' Why do women stay ? ' assumes that these women have not left , when many of them have , &quot; says Patricia Occhiuzzo Giggans , executive_director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women . &quot; The other question often asked is , ' Why do they go_back for more ? ' They don ' t go_back for more of the battering . They go_back for ( more of ) the good stuff. &quot; They go_back for the stuff that drew them to their partners in the first place . For what is largely forgotten by a public that often comes_to know domestic violence through headlines and tabloid TV -- as with O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson -- is that the violence is but one part of a complex human equation . Love is another . &quot; God how I loved you , &quot; Kat wrote in her hospital journal in the aftermath of a suicide attempt , four months after she filed for divorce . &quot; I used to be unable to do anything but think_about you when you were away . I loved lying_in bed with you , eating oranges or cookies and talking and laughing. &quot; The physical violence began in_earnest two years into a marriage filled with verbal abuse , sexual terror , being pushed from the car and left in the middle of nowhere . The first assault was &quot; stunning , &quot; she said , complete with smashed furniture , facial bruises , rape . She left several times . He wooed her back , wrote her notes , bought her gifts . He terrorized her back , said he couldn ' t live without her , said she would n ' t live at all . Fear and shame kept her quiet ; she never called police , visited the hospital , filed charges . The last time was the worst time . She had already decided to leave him , rented a house in Toluca Lake , gone_back to their apartment at the Marina City Club to gather her things , to see her cat . Her husband was gone . She fell_asleep . He came_home drunk . From her journal : &quot; Making me stand there for hours while he raved at me . Dragging me by my hair when he had to go_to the bathroom and tying me up while he did . And then he raped me . Booze on his breath , his weight . The music very loud . The terror . . . . &quot; A writer , artist and former battered woman , Kat keeps a photo album of her many lives . She takes it with her when she speaks_to volunteers on hot_lines , teaching them the ins and outs of life amid abuse . The album shows between times , aftermaths , affection , despair . There is no violence in its pages , just a life that spirals out of control , just the love , just the pain . Her husband starts_out handsome , becomes bloated and angry . Kat starts_out a beauty , becomes a mannequin . &quot; Look_at that face , &quot; she says . &quot; I look_like I ' m dead. &quot; For this is what exists between the pull of love and the push of violence -- an unsteady diet of degradation and daily life , tension and tedium , what Betty Fisher , executive_director of Haven Hills shelter in the San Fernando Valley , refers to as &quot; random reinforcement. &quot; Sometimes the batterer is awful , sometimes wonderful , sometimes barely there at all . He is controlling in ways that are hard to pinpoint , blaming , instructing , demanding , attentive . Kat ' s husband knew where she was at every moment , popped_up when he was least expected , omnipotent . Shawn Barton ' s boyfriend cracked the code to her answering service , checked her messages daily . Dianne ' s husband was far less subtle , keeping her home without car , phone or money . &quot; People hear about domestic violence when the situation is extreme , &quot; says Jody Brown , a social psychologist with the Family Violence Research Program at the University of Rhode Island . &quot; They haven ' t seen the build-up , the slow insinuation of power and control . The first time the violence happens , the woman thinks , ' Surely this can ' t be happening. ' The second time she thinks , ' Surely this can ' t be happening again. ' &quot; And this is the paradox : The early violence is generally the mildest , the easiest to explain away . It leaves the greatest room for hope that the abuse will not recur , the greatest room for belief when the battering partner says that he will never do_it again , the greatest chance to keep a family together . But &quot; at an unconscious level , the fact that she stays with him despite the violence , symbolizes for him a certain license to repeat the violence , &quot; says Lee Ann Hoff in &quot; Battered Women as Survivors. &quot; The first time that Dianne ' s husband beat her , he used a club of solid oak . He knocked her out and split her head open , spent five days in jail and was ordered to counseling . She believed him when he said he was sorry . Alcoholics Anonymous and anger counseling helped for a while . But he discovered he could fake attendance at AA , realized that Dianne was going_to stay . His drinking increased along with his sadism . &quot; We had cockroaches in the apartment , &quot; she recalls . &quot; He ' d burn them , maim them , watch them wiggle , pour hot oil on them and watch them suffer. &quot; He began to stay away at night , and beat her again when he reappeared . Eight months after the first beating , she left for good . &quot; I simply could not and would not live_in fear anymore , &quot; she said . But the leaving was a process . Her daughter helped by not helping anymore . &quot; She just got tired_of listening , tired_of the fact that I kept going_back , &quot; Dianne said . She started attending Al-Anon meetings , because &quot; I didn ' t have anything of myself left . I ' d given him parts of myself that I couldn ' t afford to lose , &quot; she said . &quot; Al-Anon gave me some of that back. &quot; She talked him into buying a car . And when she finally could not envision staying with him and staying alive she left . She had the car and the clothes on her back . &quot; You get_to the point where you ' re afraid to smile , to say I love you , &quot; she said . It got_to the point where I was living with a stranger . It was as if the man I had married had died . . . . I was afraid for my life. &quot; This is what it ' s like to be a battered woman , a badly armed soldier in the most private of wars : You go_in whole . You come_out in pieces . You go_in with perhaps a tenuous hold_on self-respect . You come_out after doing many , many things that you are not proud_of . Or you do not come_out at all . &quot; If someone was around , he was Mr. Charm , the perfect prince , &quot; says Dianne , 45 . &quot; I was the ' Psycho. ' That was what he called his second wife , too . And his mother . . . . By the time I got ( to the shelter ) I was pretty much drained of all_the courage I had. &quot; The statistics : More_than a third of all battered women frequently feel sad or depressed , say Richard J . Gelles and Murray A . Straus , in &quot; Intimate Violence : The Definitive Study of the Causes and Consequences of Abuse in the American Family. &quot; Forty-six abused women in 1 # 000 contemplate suicide frequently . &quot; The women who walk in these doors have so_much courage , &quot; says Betty Fisher of Haven Hills . &quot; It ' s courage brought_about by desperation . Knowing what they know , to be able to come_in here is just incredible. &quot; Or at very least incredibly lucky . First they have to reach a point where change is possible -- a process being studied now by Jody Brown at the University of Rhode Island . The key to change , says Brown , is for the woman to discover &quot; that there is a possibility for something different and to know that it can happen for them. &quot; They will probably relapse , returning to their violent homes . Brown describes this not as failure but as a natural a part of any change , be it quitting smoking or losing_weight . &quot; Change is dynamic , slow and incremental , &quot; Brown says . &quot; It happens in stages . . . . Change does not happen all at once. &quot; Once a battered woman has reached the point where she is ready to leave she has to find a shelter spot that ' s open -- a small miracle in itself . At Haven House in Pasadena , bilingual outreach counselor Ana Espinoza figures that 55 families are turned_away each month , largely for lack of space . If the battered woman does not find a place to stay she probably will end_up on the street , says Linda Bodin , Los Angeles County deputy district_attorney in_charge of the domestic violence unit . &quot; She ' s got the kids and she ' s going_to live_out of the car . . . . After three days , the money runs_out . All she ' s got is what she has in her pocket , because he controls the money . And so , she goes_home . And finally , she gets killed. &quot; Sometimes she gets killed even if she does not go_back . Law_enforcement officials estimate that 29 % of female homicide victims are killed by a husband or lover -- most often when they are trying to leave the relationship . For Mary Hollis , 53 , leaving became more dangerous than staying . Hollis still bears three small scars , reminders of a relationship that came_to an end in Boston 27 years ago . One scar is where the bullet went_in when her boyfriend -- whom she had left more_than a month earlier -- shot her in front of her family and friends . The second is where surgeons poked around looking_for it . The third , where it came_out . &quot; I think_about it sometimes , &quot; says the woman , who was driven by abuse to hiding knives beneath her mattress and practicing how to kill her boyfriend . &quot; I think_about it because I ' m still alive . I think_about it when I hear the statistics about how many battered women die in the course of a week , in the course of a year . I think_about it because I could have been one of those statistics. &quot; Her boyfriend got a three-year suspended sentence for battering and attempted murder . He spent six months in a Massachusetts jail for possession of a firearm . Mary Hollis vowed never to be beaten again . She has kept that promise to herself . If you think that Mary Hollis ' story is an artifact of an earlier generation -- the justice system in the bad old days -- all you need to do is listen to Shawn Barton , who was not yet born when Hollis was shot . Shawn Barton , 25 , learned the ways of battered women and abusive men on the campus of a pricey Southern California university . The first time her boyfriend raised a hand against her , they were sleeping_in her dorm_room underneath her fan . Barton got cold and turned it off . He turned it on . She turned it off again . &quot; He beat the crap out of me just for that , rolled_over and went_to_sleep , &quot; says Barton , who was 22 at the time and far too frightened to leave . &quot; I lay there stunned. &quot; He appeared on campus unbidden , like a wraith , checking_up_on her , scaring her home . Fear kept her quiet . Anxiety kept her close_at_hand . Break_up with him while still at school ? No way . &quot; I would be too vulnerable . And if I told my mother , &quot; Barton says , &quot; he would have killed me. &quot; She loved him at first and hated him later , thought she could save him but came_up short . The school_year ended , she moved_back home and slowly , carefully tried to ease her way to safety . It did not work . First came the stalking . Then the death threats . Then the end . &quot; I would n ' t talk to him and said the relationship was over , &quot; she recounted . &quot; It angered him . He took_out his anger one night by setting my car on_fire and almost burning_down my house . that ' s how it ended. &quot; She went_to court . He went_to jail for six months . She is safe . So far .</TEXT>
