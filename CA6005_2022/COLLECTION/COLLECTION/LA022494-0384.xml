   <TEXT> A 21-year-old man described as a &quot; computer whiz &quot; by police has been arrested for allegedly &quot; cloning &quot; cellular_telephone numbers , authorities said Wednesday . Nathan A . Koval of Fountain Valley had allegedly devised a sophisticated and illegal method of obtaining free cellular_telephone time with his computer , said police Sgt . Dann Bean . &quot; In his files , we found more_than 50 telephone_numbers that he ' s tried to clone , &quot; Bean said . &quot; But it will take investigators weeks to determine the extent of the calls and the total cost. &quot; Police estimate that Koval &quot; cloned &quot; at least $ 20 # 000 worth of calls , Bean said . Investigators from the Fountain Valley Police_Department , U.S. Secret_Service and the Orange County Auto Theft Task_Force began investigating Koval last month after receiving a tip . Representatives from PacTel Cellular in Irvine met with police Wednesday to study Koval ' s paperwork . They looked_up several accounts listed among Koval ' s records , Bean said , and determined that customers had reported numbers improperly charged to these accounts . Police allege that Koval conducted the &quot; cloning &quot; from the home he shares with his parents . Koval is also suspected of conducting a telemarketing scheme . Police said he may have used his computer to obtain names and phone_numbers of potential victims and allegedly would &quot; call them and tell them they won $ 50 # 000. &quot; &quot; Then he would say that they would have to send him a money_order for several hundreds of dollars in_order for them to claim their prize , &quot; Bean said . Koval is being held_on $ 10 # 000 bail at Huntington Beach Jail on suspicion of possessing stolen property , telephone and mail_fraud , and &quot; cloning &quot; cellular_telephone numbers .
