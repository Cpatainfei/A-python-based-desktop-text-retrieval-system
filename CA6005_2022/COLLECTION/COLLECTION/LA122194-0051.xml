   <TEXT> The Federal_Reserve ' s decision to leave interest_rates alone for now failed to prevent another stumble for Wall_Street on Tuesday . Stocks were dragged_down by other considerations .

The meeting of the Fed ' s policy committee the center of investors ' attention . Although it was widely assumed that the panel would refrain_from raising rates for a seventh time this year , the markets were not certain of that until the meeting was over .

Among the market highlights : * Microsoft ' s announcement of the delay in marketing the new Windows operating system sent the company ' s stock down 2 3 / 4 to 59 7 / 8 . The impact of Microsoft ' s announcement was offset by welcome news from Intel , which moved to solve problems involving the flawed Pentium chip . Intel ' s stock surged 3 7 / 16 to 61 1 / 4 , and Intel ' s promise to replace the chips free_of charge , no questions asked , also helped other computer stocks . Dell Computer rose 1 to 38 3 / 8 on Nasdaq . In Mexico , investors snapped_up stocks after the government dropped the peso ' s floor in_relation_to the dollar . But the rally lost steam on news from Chiapas that police and army troops were moving_into recently captured rebel territory , and the Bolsa finished 43.06 points higher at 2 # 274.17. In New York , however , Mexican stocks stumbled on news of the devaluation . Telefonos de Mexico fell 2 1 / 2 to 46 ; Grupo Televisa fell 3 3 / 8 to 35 1 / 2 . * Glaxo ' s American depository receipts rose 1 to 20 3 / 4 after the_British drug maker said it expects the U.S. patent on its Zantac ulcer medication will be extended . * Monsanto tumbled 4 to 68 7 / 8 on news that it will buy Merck ' s Kelco business .
