   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : STORM EXPECTED TO HIT REGION BY END OF WEEK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Morning drizzle expected today along the coast should give_way to rain later this week as a cold_front from the Gulf of Alaska moves_into Southern California , forecasters said Monday . The storm is expected to bring cooler temperatures and spring showers , leaving as much as . 75 inch of rain along the coast , 1.5 inches inland and up_to three inches in the mountains , said National Weather Service meteorologist Brad Fujii . Fujii said the chance of rain is slight Thursday and Friday . &quot; But we should get wet by Saturday , &quot; he said . Temperatures in the upper 50s to low 60s on Thursday and Friday should drop into the low to mid-50s Saturday , said Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData , which forecasts weather for The Times . But warm temperatures are expected to return after the weekend , he said . &quot; It looks_like after this little bout of rain , an upper-level ridge will keep things dry , &quot; Brack said . Forecasters said air quality should be good this week because of the oncoming storm , but as April approaches , air quality could worsen , said Kent Field , a forecaster with the Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District . &quot; We ' re about done with the rain , and when we get high_pressure in here it could mean ozone again , &quot; Field said . Although the smog season does not officially start until May 1 , forecasters say unseasonably warm temperatures have caused increases in ozone levels . &quot; Ozone doesn ' t always follow the political rules , &quot; Field said . &quot; We start watching when the weather patterns start changing and we ' re starting to get_into spring weather. &quot; TRACY WILSON</TEXT>
