   <HEADLINE> BEAGLES , DALMATIAN POINT WAY IN ALZHEIMER ' S STUDY ; MEDICINE : UC DAVIS RESEARCHERS EXAMINE DOGS FOR CLUES TO THE PROGRESSIVE BRAIN DISORDER THAT AFFECTS 4 MILLION AMERICANS . SADIE THE DALMATIAN HAD ALL THE SIGNS -- CONFUSION , MEMORY_LOSS , INAPPROPRIATE OUTBURSTS , EVEN PROTEIN DEPOSITS IN HER BRAIN . UNIVERSITY ALSO MAINTAINS KENNEL OF CANINES AND TESTS THEIR MEMORIES AS THEY AGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For much of her life , Sadie had it all : good_health , a fine home , a family that adored her . But with old_age came senility , robbing her , bit by bit , of her personality . Once known for her hearty appetite , she picked_at her food , sometimes wandering off in the middle of a meal . She began getting lost in the only home she ' d ever known . A lifelong extrovert , she sat for hours staring at the wall . Test after test came_back normal . But the signs were all there : memory_loss , confusion , inappropriate outbursts . The doctors were quite certain . They ' d seen it before . Had Sadie been human , she might have lived_out her days in a nursing_home , or been cared_for at_home by round-the-clock nurses or aides . But Sadie was a dog , a 17-year-old Dalmatian , so her life ended quickly and mercifully with a lethal injection . Her story , however , goes_on . * Sadie ' s family donated her body to the University of California at Davis , where researchers examined her aged brain and found something remarkable . Buried within the tissue were protein deposits identical to those found in the brains of human Alzheimer ' s patients . Alzheimer ' s disease is a progressive brain disorder that impairs memory , thinking and behavior in 4 million Americans . No cause or cure has been found . Scientists have long known that aging primates -- monkeys , bears , dogs -- can develop the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are the hallmarks of Alzheimer ' s disease . What they don ' t know is whether these neurological signs are the animal equivalent of Alzheimer ' s or simply the more general signature of an aging brain . The answer may rest in a locked kennel at UC Davis , where 40 aging beagles pass their days playing with toys and with each other . Their primary job : to grow old . As they age , protein deposits form in their brains that are remarkably similar in size , structure and location to those found in humans with Alzheimer ' s . Periodically , the beagles go swimming in a huge above-ground pool . The surface is covered with colored beads . Hidden beneath the beads is a submerged platform the dogs have been previously shown . The time it takes them to find the platform gives clues as_to their memory ability . The tests are repeated months later . Michael J . Russell , head of the Canine Aging Project and an assistant_professor of anesthesiology and otolaryngology , says the results so far have been intriguing . &quot; In the first test , the old dogs learned faster , but their memory was shot . When we retested 19 dogs a year later , the young dogs_did better . The old dogs forgot where the island was. &quot; that ' s significant because inability to recall new events is a primary symptom of Alzheimer ' s in humans . &quot; People with Alzheimer ' s will sit and tell you what happened 20 years ago . But one reason the illness is so upsetting is that it ' s very common for a relative to come_in and a patient to say , ' You ' re not my daughter. ' The patient is remembering a much younger child. &quot; * The Canine Aging Project , funded by the National Institutes of Health , started a year and a half ago . Russell had just put his own mother in a nursing_home . At the time , she was thought to have Alzheimer ' s disease , although doctors have since attributed her dementia to a series of small strokes . For animals as well as for humans , Alzheimer ' s can ' t be definitively diagnosed without an autopsy . So far , of the dogs in Russell ' s study , only those with painful or terminal illnesses have been put_to_sleep . The rest live_out their natural life spans , typically about 16 years . As they die , the dogs ' brains are examined for plaques . The findings are then checked against the animals ' performance in the water maze , for evidence of a connection between neurological signs of disease and memory_loss . So far , only eight dogs have died . But researchers have examined archived tissue from more_than 150 others that died at university clinics or that were used in previous life-span studies . Several patterns have emerged . Whether a dog develops amyloid plaques depends_on which litter it came from , suggesting some prenatal influence . &quot; We also think there ' s a relationship between breed and heredity , &quot; Russell said . None of the dogs has developed plaques prior to age 10 . that ' s also the age when other serious illnesses start to appear , according to clinical records of more_than a_thousand dogs kept by university veterinarian Dr. Russell White . &quot; Something happens at age 10 that correlates with other disease processes , &quot; Russell said . &quot; There is a mechanism that allows these events to occur , some threshold or trigger event . I don ' t know what it is. &quot; The length of a dog ' s life may also play a role . Big dogs , such_as Great Danes and Saint Bernards , have shorter life spans than small dogs , such_as poodles and beagles . They also are far less likely to develop plaques . Despite such differences , &quot; it ' s clearly an animal that develops an age-related pathology that resembles Alzheimer ' s , &quot; said Jim Geddes , an assistant_professor of anatomy and neurobiology at the University of Kentucky ' s Sanders Brown Center_on Aging . In addition to shedding new light on Alzheimer ' s disease in humans , Russell hopes his study will lead to new treatments that will extend the lives of dogs , particularly service dogs . The search for an animal model for Alzheimer ' s has been under way since shortly after the disease was first described in 1907 . Without one , &quot; you ' ve got_to make some big jumps from the test_tube to the human_being , &quot; said Peter Davies , a researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City . &quot; A good animal model would be enormously valuable . For those of us involved in attempts to devise new strategies for treating Alzheimer ' s , one of the great hurdles has been that there ' s no animal on which to test new compounds we think might be effective. &quot; The search has taken_on new urgency in light of an aging population . Alzheimer ' s disease can affect people in their 40s and 50s , but most of its victims are older . Studies have shown that the incidence of Alzheimer ' s , just 3 % at age 65 , soars to 45 % at age 85 . The number of Americans 85 and over is the fastest-growing segment of the population , expected to more_than double_over the next 25 years . There are now 3.4 million people in this age_group . The U.S. Census_Bureau projects that by 2020 , there will be nearly 7 million . &quot; We ' ve been successful at making people live longer , &quot; Russell said . &quot; As baby_boomers approach old_age , there will be a huge social and economic drain . The numbers will equal the incidence of AIDS in some African villages. &quot; The average nursing_home stay for a patient with Alzheimer ' s is five to seven years , Russell said . The average annual cost per patient : $ 213 # 732 , according to one recent study . &quot; The most common cause of death for people with Alzheimer ' s is pneumonia , &quot; Russell said . &quot; They die as a result of being bedridden and immobile . You can lose almost all_of the cortical layer of your brain and survive . But people can ' t stay bedridden for long. &quot; While no one knows what causes Alzheimer ' s , some scientists believe the disease begins when beta-amyloid , a protein sometimes found in healthy brains , inexplicably begins to accumulate into deposits or plaques . The plaques then convert to a toxic -- &quot; neuritic &quot; -- form that ultimately destroys brain_cells . Other scientists believe amyloid is a byproduct of another disease process that has yet to be discovered . * Researchers are using genetic_engineering and other techniques to try to develop a rat with Alzheimer ' s . But even if they succeed , without knowing what causes the disease , they may have no way of knowing whether they ' ve re-created the illness or merely mimicked its symptoms , Russell said . At the same time , he said , 40 lab rats cost just a couple hundred dollars to maintain , compared to $ 98 # 000 for 40 dogs . There ' s also huge savings in the amount of experimental compounds needed for testing on rats as opposed to dogs . But rats live just three years , which may_not be long enough to develop plaques . &quot; For certain treatments dealing with aging , you need a species with a midlife span , &quot; Russell said . &quot; Dogs get many conditions that are slow developing , like arthritis and heart_disease . Here we ' ve got a species that lives long enough to be examinable. &quot; Dogs are also readily available . The American Humane Assn . estimates that 6.3 million dogs were euthanized in 1992 . &quot; The question is , &quot; Russell said , &quot; are we going_to use that tissue or continue to burn it or bury it ? &quot; Dogs also live with people and share the same conditions , which could provide additional clues with_regard_to environmental factors implicated in Alzheimer ' s . Dogs raised in rural Poland were found to have fewer senile plaques than those raised in more polluted industrial and urban_areas . Russell says the strictly controlled_conditions under which his dogs have been raised could explain why they have fewer senile plaques than dogs previously studied . The discovery of amyloid in dogs dates_back to 1912 , but nobody paid much attention . Russell blames the difficulty of acquiring enough old dogs , along with the fact that not all breeds develop plaques . &quot; And , socially , we ' re all a little uncomfortable -- myself included -- that it happens to be dogs . If it were sheep or pigs , it would be different. &quot; * The UC beagles are the legacy of a now-defunct U.S. Department_of_Energy study that measured the effects of radiation on dogs . These animals were descendants of the control group , the group not exposed to radiation . &quot; Visitors welcome , &quot; reads the sign posted outside their kennel . The barking begins the minute Russell turns his key in the lock . They have lived their whole lives on this campus , as have seven or eight generations of beagles before them . Everything reasonable is done to prolong their lives . They ' re examined four times a year and fed a special diet developed by university scientists . Equal attention is paid to their mental_health . Though their contact with humans is limited , the dogs have ready access to each other . They ' re given toys to play with and bones to chew . But they are not pets . Pick one up and it looks_at you curiously , enjoying the attention but unsure what to make of it . Pet it and its tail will not wag . It will not lick your face , only sniff at you gently . These are lab animals with a job to do , albeit one that comes naturally . And although researchers have yet to sacrifice any of these animals , they are resigned to doing so should they deem it necessary . The fight against Alzheimer ' s disease &quot; is a war , &quot; Russell said . &quot; You send soldiers to war , and some of them die. &quot;</TEXT>
