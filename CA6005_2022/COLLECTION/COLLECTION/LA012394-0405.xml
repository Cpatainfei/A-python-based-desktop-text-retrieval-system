   <HEADLINE> RENT WATCH : CAN DEPOSIT BE KEPT FOR QUAKE DAMAGE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Editor ' s Note : The following two questions are from an earlier &quot; Rent W atch &quot; column , but may be helpful to victims of last Monday ' s earthquake . QUESTION : The apartment in which I have lived for several years received heavy damage during the earthquake . Since it may be a long_time before the building becomes habitable and because I rent on a monthly basis , the landlord and I have agreed to terminate my tenancy . I ' m worried about my deposit . Can he use it for repairs , or am I entitled to get_it back ? ANSWER : Yes , you are entitled to a refund of your deposit . A security_deposit cannot be used to repair damage caused by a natural disaster . Unless you owe the landlord rent , you should receive your deposit in full , because cleaning costs have obviously become irrelevant , and any property_owner who attempts to deduct cleaning costs will be hard pressed to justify them . Be sure that you notify your landlord in writing_of your new address so that the check can reach you . California Civil Code , Section 1950.5 , which regulates the return of rental deposits , remains valid in these circumstances and requires the landlord to refund your deposit within 14 days . Is Owner Responsible_for Tenants ' Property ? Q : Several units in an apartment_building I own suffered damage in the earthquake . I have managed to make arrangements for repairs and to control the major problems , but two of my tenants feel that I should reimburse them for broken dishes , damaged furniture and food spoiled during the power outage after the quake . My expenses are already very high . Am I also liable for damage to their personal_property ? A : Probably not . You can only be held liable for damage to tenants ' property if the tenants can prove that your negligent maintenance of the building caused the damage . Otherwise , the tenants must pay to repair or replace their own damaged possessions . If your tenants have renter ' s insurance_policies , they should file claims to see what compensation they are eligible to receive . Manager Keeps Pet Deposit as Punishment Q : According to my rental agreement , I was allowed to keep one cat inside my apartment , and I even paid an additional pet deposit . When I found an abandoned cat on a cold rainy_day , I felt I had to take it in , but I did not tell my landlord of adopting this second pet . By pure happenstance , right before I moved_out , the manager discovered that I had a second cat , and refused to refund my pet deposit . Although my pets did not create any damage , the manager decided to keep my $ 200 pet deposit because I was in violation of the rental agreement . Can I do anything to get_back my money , or should I just write it off ? A : You were wrong in knowingly violating your rental agreement , and by doing so you jeopardized your tenancy . The manager could have asked you through a written notice to either move_out or get_rid_of your second pet within three days , had he discovered sooner that you acquired a second cat . However , if you left the apartment in good and clean condition , and your cats did not cause any damage , the manager cannot charge you a punitive fee . All deposits on rental property must be refundable , and they can be used only for due rent , necessary cleaning or damages beyond normal wear_and_tear caused by the tenant . Deposits cannot be used as fines for agreement violations . Explain to your manager that according to California Civil Code Section 1950.5 he cannot use the deposit to punish you for violating the agreement . If he continues to withhold your deposit , you may contact your local mediation group for assistance . You may have to file an action in Small Claims Court to obtain a refund of your deposit .</TEXT>
