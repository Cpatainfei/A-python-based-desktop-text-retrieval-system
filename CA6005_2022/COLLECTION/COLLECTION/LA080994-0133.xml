   <HEADLINE> ' 86 IMMIGRANT HIRING BAN USED IN L.A. CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eight years after a sweeping immigration law made_it a crime for business owners to knowingly hire illegal immigrants , federal authorities have filed the first felony charge against an employer in Southern California . Thursday , federal prosecutors indicted a former manager of a Los Angeles medical clinic on charges of repeatedly accepting fake documents when hiring workers . The difficulty of proving such accusations , as well as political and economic factors , have hindered the filing of criminal charges before now , immigration experts say . &quot; This is the first time the INS gave us information that we think we can prove in court , &quot; said Assistant U.S. Atty . Brent Whittlesey , who is prosecuting the case . Sanctions against employers for hiring illegal immigrants were a cornerstone of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 , which contained provisions to stop the flow of illegal immigration into the United States . But criminal charges have proven difficult to enforce . Just as the debate on immigration is reaching a crescendo among many California politicians and voters , the eight-year gap underscores the seemingly impossible task of controlling the illegal tide of immigrants into the state . It also highlights the failure of the 1986 law to solve the problem , immigration advocates say . &quot; In the larger context , this is yet another example of how enforcement has been unsuccessful in stopping undocumented immigration , &quot; said Charles Wheeler , an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center . Although numerous employers have been fined for hiring illegal immigrants , the absence of criminal charges before last week is especially puzzling given Southern California ' s prominence as a destination point for workers who enter the state illegally . Under the 1986 law , employers are required to ask workers for documents such_as a Social_Security card or work_permit , which are often counterfeited and easily obtained by illegal immigrants . Showing that a business has engaged in a pattern of knowingly hiring illegal workers is difficult to prove . But immigration experts say the recent public outcry over illegal immigration is a primary reason that charges are being filed . The heightened sentiment against illegal immigration has emboldened the government to go_after employers in this more public fashion , said Roberto Lovato , executive_director of Central_American Resource Center , an immigrant advocacy organization . &quot; The fact is the immigration debate and enforcement has been one-sided . If you don ' t look_at the employer part of it , you don ' t see the economic magnet that draws people to L.A. and California , &quot; Lovato said . In addition , the lack of previous criminal charges may reflect the government ' s reluctance to crack_down on California businesses in the midst of a recession , experts said . Business owners &quot; really like having cheap labor with limited rights , &quot; said Ira Mehlman , spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform and an outspoken proponent of the 1986 law ' s provisions . Mehlman said immigrant rights advocates also have formed a powerful constituency against employer sanctions . But Jack Kyser , a chief economist for the nonprofit Economic Development Corp. , said business is not to blame . &quot; I think that ' s an unfair characterization because businesses want to comply with the law , &quot; Kyser said . &quot; Most businesses I have dealt with realize that they cannot compete by relying_on cheap labor. &quot; Since the law was enacted , federal authorities have imposed numerous civil penalties totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars against Southern California businesses for hiring illegal workers . Random checks of businesses by Immigration and Naturalization Service agents have shown that those penalties are deterring employers from hiring illegal workers , said John Brechtel , assistant district director for investigations . &quot; The provisions work well , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re not seeing repeat violations. &quot; He said the felony case against the former medical clinic manager is far more serious than most other employer-sanction cases because the woman allegedly knew that the workers were using fake documents . In the indictment delivered last week federal prosecutors allege that Leticia Ruiz de la Cruz , 40 , knowingly accepted fake Social_Security , alien registration and temporary resident cards to hire illegal workers while serving as the manager of Clinica Medica Familiar , which operates several medical clinics in the Los Angeles area . The indictment also alleges that Ruiz encouraged people who she knew were here illegally to remain in the country . She is also charged with using a fake Social_Security_number to compute payroll taxes . Ruiz ' s attorney , Tom Mesereau , said Monday that she is innocent . &quot; We categorically and emphatically deny any guilt and look_forward to vigorously defending this case , &quot; he said . Mesereau suggested that Ruiz was being set_up by a disgruntled former employee who stole clinic documents and handed them over to INS investigators . &quot; Unfortunately , it appears that government_agencies were taken_in by this former employee , &quot; he said . Brechtel said the main problem with enforcing the law is that employers are unable to determine whether a document is counterfeit . Some immigration experts say that issue would be addressed by adopting a national identification card , a controversial proposal that has been debated in recent years by Congress . Last week , the federal Commission on Immigration recommended adopting a national identification system that included ID cards . &quot; The ( 1986 immigration ) law is_on the books , but how can you really tell that a Social_Security card is valid unless you are a documents expert , &quot; Mehlman said . &quot; that ' s really been the Achilles heel of employer sanctions. &quot; To prevent counterfeiting , proponents say , the ID card could function like a credit_card , with a magnetic strip containing information such_as a Social_Security_number and birth date . Immigrant rights advocates and civil libertarians oppose such a card , saying it would lead to a centralized filing_system that would threaten the privacy and individual rights of all Americans . Immigrant rights groups also have opposed the employer-sanction provisions of the 1986 law , saying they have led to employer discrimination against legal residents and U.S. citizens with Spanish surnames or who look foreign . A 1990 report by the federal General Accounting Office concluded that employer sanctions caused a &quot; widespread pattern of discrimination &quot; against citizens and other eligible workers . The GAO report added that employers have not stopped hiring undocumented workers . Arrests of immigrants illegally crossing the U.S. border reached a high of 1.8 million in 1986 before dropping to 954 # 000 in 1989 , according to INS data . The number of arrests reached 1.2 million in 1993 .</TEXT>
