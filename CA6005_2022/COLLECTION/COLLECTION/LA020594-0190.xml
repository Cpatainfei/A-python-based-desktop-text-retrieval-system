   <HEADLINE> STORM-WARY LAGUNA BEACH BRACES FOR MORE RAINFALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Laguna Beach and its disaster-weary residents are bracing for a new round of winter storms expected to hit the Orange County coastline by Sunday or Monday . The new forecasts leave little time for preparations , however , as a flurry of rainstorms drenched the county late Thursday and Friday , largely sparing the South County hillsides charred in last fall ' s devastating fires . Laguna Beach Fire_Chief Richard Dewberry said residents were already stacking sandbags to block possible mudslides and soil_erosion that may threaten area homes and shops . &quot; We already have heavy equipment staged at key areas in the city where small tractors , loaders , and backhoes are available to help keep drains clear , &quot; Dewberry said . The sky remained dark and threatening Friday , even after much of the county had been soaked with about two-thirds of an inch of rain . Between 4 p.m. Thursday and 4 p.m. Friday , Laguna Beach had 0.42 inches of rain , the least amount recorded in the county . &quot; The general report we have from the command_post is that everything ' s fared pretty well , &quot; said Scott Jennie , a Laguna Beach firefighter . The California Highway Patrol reported no rain-related accidents on Friday . However , a landslide caused temporary closure of Ortega Highway a mile south of the Riverside County_line Friday afternoon . Orange County health officials warned people not to swim in the ocean near the mouths of rivers , creeks and storm drains . Higher levels of bacteria usually are present after a storm because of the runoff of animal wastes , fertilizers and road oils . Across the county , rainfall for the season had reached only one-fourth of last year ' s . Santa Ana received 0.67 inches of rain by 4 p.m. Friday , bringing its season total to 3.88 inches . The city ' s total to date last season was 17.2 inches . The threatening weather was not expected to alter the plans of weekend festival organizers . Today ' s parade celebrating Black History Month is expected to go_on in Santa Ana rain or shine . Similarly , festivals celebrating Tet , the Vietnamese New Year , have not been canceled . In mountain communities , the precipitation took the form of powdery snow . Officials said the 13 inches that fell_in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains was a gratifying addition to the snowpack that contributes to the area ' s household water_supply . The snow also delighted ski resort operators who had been relying_on man-made snow . &quot; It ' s absolutely incredible . It ' s all soft and fluffy , &quot; said Libby Coleman , a spokeswoman at Big Bear ' s Bear Mountain Ski Resort . &quot; This is what we ' ve needed. &quot; Bruce Thoren , a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. , said there is a chance of more rain in Orange County on Sunday , with rain likely on Monday that could continue into Tuesday . &quot; But there might be high_pressure building in behind that , &quot; he said , &quot; with more dry weather for the rest of the week. &quot; Times Staff Writer Kevin Johnson contributed to this report . Rain Shortfall Less than an inch of rain fell_in Orange County Friday , adding little to a total already more_than four inches shy of the norm .
