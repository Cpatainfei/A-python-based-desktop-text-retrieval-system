   <HEADLINE> THE MELDING AMERICAS ; VIEWS FROM THE SOUTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The gringos , who later brought their languid women with muslin dresses and big gauze hats , built a separate town on the other side of the tracks , with palm lined streets , houses with metal grated windows , little white tables on the terraces and paddle fans hanging from the ceiling , and wide blue lawns with peacocks and quail . The sector was enclosed by a wire mesh fence , like a giant electrified chicken pen that in the cool months of summer woke_up black with fried swallows . No one even knew yet what it was they wanted , or whether they really were nothing more_than philanthropists , and they had already brought_on a colossal disturbance , much more disquieting than the gypsies of old , but less transitory and comprehensible . Equipped with resources that in another era were reserved for Divine Providence , they modified the rainfall regime , hastened the harvest cycle , and took the river from where it always had been and put it with its white rocks and its cold currents on the other side of the town , behind the cemetery . It was_on that occasion that they built a concrete fortress over the discolored tomb of Jose Arcadio , so that the odor of cadaver dust would not contaminate the waters. &quot; Gabriel Garcia Marquez , &quot; One Hundred Years of Solitude &quot; ( 1967 ) * &quot; Upon initiating my life in the United States , I resided for some time in Los Angeles , a city inhabitated by more_than a_million persons of Mexican descent . At first sight , the traveler is surprised by -- besides the pureness of the sky and the ugliness of the dispersed and ostentatious constructions -- the vaguely Mexican atmosphere of the city , impossible to capture in words or concepts . This Mexicanness -- a taste for adornments , carelessness and splendor , negligence , passion and reserve -- floats in the air . And I say floats because it does not mix nor is it joined with the other world , the North_American world , made of precision and efficiency . Floats but does not oppose ; is balanced , driven by the wind , at times torn like a cloud , at others straightened like a rocket shooting off . It is dragged along , it yields , it expands , it contracts , sleeps or dreams , ragged beauty . It floats : It does not cease to exist , does not disappear. &quot; Octavio Paz , &quot; The Labyrinth of Solitude &quot; ( 1963 ) * &quot; The North_American has to understand that Latin_America comes from things that you have never known at all . You have never known Indian empires based on theocracy and vertical structures of power . You were not colonized by a European autocracy constructed also in a vertical fashion . . . . Which means the common_good is the purpose of politics , and it is_best achieved by unity exercised through one will , through an autocracy . That is ingrained in the Latin_American soul. &quot; Carlos Fuentes , Los Angeles Times interview ( 1992 )</TEXT>
