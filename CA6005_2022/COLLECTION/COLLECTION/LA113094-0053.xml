   <HEADLINE> SKIING / BOB LOCHNER ; IT ' S EARLY , BUT SLOPES BELIE IT ACROSS WEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s almost like midwinter in the mountains of the Western United States , but more like midsummer in the Alps . As a result , while skiers have been enjoying some of the best early season conditions in many years on slopes in Southern California , the Sierra , the Cascades and much of the Rockies , ski racers in Europe have been staring out their hotel windows at barren hillsides from Switzerland to Italy and into France . The situation has become so critical that U.S. Skiing in Park City , Utah , site of last weekend ' s World Cup women ' s races , has offered to help relocate some of the December events in North_America . &quot; We contacted the International Ski Federation ( FIS ) to advise that U.S. Skiing was able to coordinate sites for additional men ' s events in the next few weeks , &quot; U.S. Alpine Director Paul Major said Tuesday . &quot; The FIS is very interested in the proposal and could make a decision in the next few days. &quot; * Snow is especially plentiful throughout California at the moment . Mammoth Mountain , for example , reported 66-90 inches Tuesday , and spokeswoman Mary Shoshone said , &quot; The skiing has been terrific ever since we opened on Oct . 8. &quot; That was the earliest starting date ever for Mammoth , where 95 % of the mountain is now open -- including Warming Hut II , which hadn ' t been used for Thanksgiving in 11 years . A storm late Friday and early Saturday cut_into holiday crowds , but the resort 300 miles north of Los Angeles still played host to 29 # 000 skiers over the four-day weekend . Getting a lot of play was Mammoth ' s new high-speed quad chairlift that replaced the old No . 16 . In the Southland , Snow Summit , Bear Mountain , Snow Valley , Mountain High and Mt . Baldy are operating daily , with Ski Sunrise set to go Friday . &quot; Conditions are terrific , like mid-January , &quot; Snow Summit spokeswoman Bonnie Tregaskis said . &quot; The cold temperatures have been great for snowmaking , to go_with the natural snow , and have produced really squeaky packed powder. &quot; Snow Summit ' s new high-speed quad chairlift , the All Mountain Xpress , is already rolling , boosting skiers 1 # 200 vertical feet from the base area to the top of the mountain , and its new half-pipe provides snowboard riders twice the length of the old one . Both Snow Summit , which opened on Nov . 11 , and its Big Bear neighbor , Bear Mountain , have up_to 36 inches of snow . Bear Mountain , which started its season on Nov . 4 , opened Geronimo Trail , its double-black-diamond run_on Bear Peak , Tuesday , and according to spokeswoman Julie Grant , the new Terrain Garden is quickly becoming popular_with both riders and skiers who dabble_in freestyle acrobatics . Snow Valley , which has been going since Nov . 12 and now has a 30-inch base , spent $ 1.5 million over the summer to cover Slide Peak , its most advanced area , with snowmaking gear . &quot; Then , would n ' t you know it , we got all this natural snow too , &quot; spokeswoman Margi LaPorte said . Over near Wrightwood , Mountain High ' s west_side has been operational since Nov . 11 with a base of up_to 24 inches , and spokeswoman Tracy Henry said , &quot; We have many_more runs open than usual for so early in the season . We ' re making snow on the east_side and hope to have it ready in a_few days , as well. &quot; * Lake Tahoe ski resorts have also been humming since early this month , with snow depths ranging generally from 36 to 84 inches , and Utah isn ' t far behind . There ' s a 56-inch base at Park City , where Switzerland ' s 30-year-old Vreni Schneider scored her 52nd World Cup victory in Sunday ' s slalom after finishing third behind teammate Heidi Zeller-Baehler in a giant slalom the day before . The women are scheduled to compete in a downhill and super-G this weekend at Vail , Colo. , followed by a giant slalom at Breckenridge , Colo. , Monday . They will then travel_to Lake Louise , Canada , for another downhill and super-G on Dec . 10-11 before going_to Europe . The season-opening competitions for both men and women at Saas Fe , Switzerland , were canceled because of a lack of snow , as were men ' s events last weekend at Sestriere , Italy , and this weekend at Val d ' Isere , France . Three men ' s races in Italy on Dec . 10-11-13 are also threatened . Meanwhile , World Cup organizers are hoping that the higher altitude at Tignes , France , will let them hold a giant slalom and slalom Saturday and Sunday . Major , whose U.S. women ' s team placed only one racer in the top 30 last weekend -- Heidi Voelker ' s 27th Sunday -- is eager to give his male skiers some additional home-snow advantage before their scheduled stops at Whistler , Canada , and Aspen , Colo. , three months from now . &quot; We have had discussions on possible schedule ( changes ) , &quot; he said , &quot; but there is nothing set . We hope to work together with the Canadian Ski Assn . in addition to ( adding ) U.S. sites. &quot;</TEXT>
