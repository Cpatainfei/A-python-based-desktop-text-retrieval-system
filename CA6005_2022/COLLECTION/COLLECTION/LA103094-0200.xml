   <HEADLINE> STANDS ON LOCAL ISSUES COULD DECIDE 24TH DISTRICT RACE ; CONSTITUENCY DOES NOT REALLY FEEL CONNECTED TO WHAT IS MAKING THE NEWS IN THE NATION ' S CAPITAL . VOTERS ' CONCERNS ARE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT AFFECT THEM DIRECTLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; All politics is local , &quot; Thomas P . ( Tip ) O ' Neill , the late Speaker of the House of Representatives , opined . And , in its enigmatic way , it ' s one of the very few political axioms that actually work_out to be true . Its effect is especially tough on candidates running_for offices that are not local . In 1978 , and for every election since , candidates for Congress have been asked where they stand on Proposition 13 -- the state ' s property tax-cutting initiative . It defined for voters those candidates who supported a tax_break versus those who didn ' t . The pesky details didn ' t matter . The entire California Democrat establishment opposed Proposition 13 . It hurt incumbents in 1978 . Now-Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren defeated an incumbent congressman that year largely on the strength of Proposition 13 , after having lost to him two years before . Similarly , congressional candidates have been asked_for eight years if they supported or opposed Rose Bird ' s confirmation in 1986 . Proposition 13 and Rose Bird had nothing to do with congressional actions . They were , however , defining issues for California voters . Another potentially defining issue appears on next month ' s ballot . Congressional races are filled with candidate appearances at which the majority of the questions concern issues over which Congress has no jurisdiction -- real_estate development , local crime , traffic hazards . The candidate who is primed to talk_about foreign trade and nuclear proliferation is often caught off_guard . In the early 1980s when George_Bush was vice_president , his staff would contact the staffs of congressional offices in the areas he was to visit . They would ask , &quot; What are the local issues ? &quot; Bush ' s people did not want him trapped by a question regarding a local sewer bond issue . I believe Tip O ' Neill meant &quot; local &quot; to mean those issues voters &quot; back home &quot; read about in their local newspapers , not what appears in the Washington Post . When I wrote two months ago about the 24th Congressional District race between incumbent Anthony Beilenson and challenger Richard Sybert , Congress was still in session . The local news was filled with stories about health_care reform , various international crises and , of course , the O.J. Simpson trial . * The only one of those stories still in the paper with any regularity is Simpson , and even it ' s lost a lot of its excitement and immediacy . The trial itself will not get under way until after the election . Nationally , the only consistent story now is how poorly the pundits think Democrats will fare at the polls . Internationally , unless there is large-scale violence , Haiti is a yawner . And , until he tries something stupid , Saddam Hussein is old news . If &quot; all politics is local , &quot; national voting trends don ' t affect local races . Bob Dole could become Senate majority_leader . Less likely -- but possible -- Newt Gingrich could become House Speaker . That kind of shift holds little interest to voters in Reseda , Woodland Hills or Westlake Village . They do not perceive Washington insider issues as having an effect on them . Illegal aliens standing on street_corners or carjackers lurking at the ATM are far more potent images . Dick Riordan ' s 1993 campaign brochure featuring a scruffy looking homeless man on the cover welcoming voters to &quot; Mike Woo ' s Los Angeles &quot; won Riordan more votes than his term limit initiative . So what ' s capturing the voters ' attention in the 24th District ? Crime , underground versus monorail for Metrorail , various real_estate developments and , most significantly , Proposition 187 -- the state immigration initiative . As the two candidates square_off for more forums in this final campaign week , these are the topics voters are likely to ask about , not international trade agreements or lobbying reform . What have the candidates said about these non-federal issues ? After the last article I wrote dealing with the history of elections in Beilenson ' s district , my mailman lugged a pound of issue papers to my door from challenger Sybert . An enclosed book had three paragraphs on schools , decidedly not a congressional front-burner issue . A packet of op-ed pieces penned by Sybert included one on crime . His campaign brochure includes a mention of growth management . His comparison brochure points_out that he opposed Rose Bird . He even mentions that he is supported by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Organization -- code words for supporting Proposition 13 . While crime and taxes are always effective standbys , the lightning_rod in this election is clearly Proposition 187 . This could provide the nexus between the national trend against Democrats and the local issue dominating the race . Sybert supports 187 . Beilenson opposes it . As this issue takes_up more and more space in newspapers and more time on television_news , it moves toward the top of the issues list in voters ' consciousness . Despite high-level opposition , including that of the Mexican government , the U.S. President and 70 # 000 marchers waving Mexican flags in Downtown Los Angeles , polls reveal that support for Proposition 187 remains strong among most voter groups . This , then , becomes a defining issue and creates a litmus test for candidates . The races on the top of the ticket have argued over little else for the past week . * Sybert can capitalize on Proposition 187 , putting Beilenson on the defensive . If the margins in favor of this proposal in the most recent Times poll hold_up through election_day , it could be the issue that denies Beilenson his 10th term . Of course , a backlash could develop against the initiative between now and Election_Day . In 1978 an initiative to ban homosexuals from teaching positions failed after initial support in polls . Voters , apparently , felt the penalties were too Draconian and the definitions of who was or who wasn ' t were too mushy . So , we come_back to political axioms . The other one that almost always holds true has been around for more_than 2 # 000 years . The Roman poet Horace wrote carpe diem -- seize the day . The candidate in the 24th District who can effectively communicate he has firmly seized it will be the winner when dawn breaks Nov . 9 .</TEXT>
