   <HEADLINE> UNIONS DO A U-TURN ON IMMIGRANT WORKER ISSUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s labor_unions have a history of stomping on Latino and Asian immigrants , blaming them along with exploitative employers for driving down American wages . In the 1970s , even the revered labor_leader Cesar Chavez called illegal immigrants from Mexico a &quot; severe problem , &quot; and he routinely reported undocumented farm_workers to federal authorities . Yet today , the state ' s top labor_leaders are among the most forceful opponents of Proposition 187 , the ballot measure intended to crack_down on illegal immigrants by denying them many public_services . What prompted organized labor to stop shunning undocumented workers and instead join immigrant rights activists in fighting the measure , even back when defeating it seemed nearly hopeless ? The reasons reflect a mix of idealism and self-interest and represent both the current political climate along with a gradual evolution in the California labor_movement . All told , blaming illegal immigrants for today ' s economic problems &quot; is not the answer , &quot; said David Sickler , regional director of the AFL-CIO district encompassing California , Hawaii and Nevada . An emerging generation of California labor_leaders envisions poorly paid foreign-born workers -- regardless of their immigration status -- as becoming a booming new base of support for U.S. unions . They are heartened by major union organizing victories in recent years involving immigrant drywallers and janitors , among other workers . As such , they are more or less following the path taken by Chavez , the late president of the United Farm_Workers union , who eventually reversed his position on undocumented Mexican workers and came_to regard them as part of the UFW ' s natural constituency . But other factors also figure in organized labor ' s decision to fight Proposition 187 , a step that has brought_together the state ' s most conservative and liberal union leaders . If the measure passes and survives court challenges , such unionized workers as teachers and nurses could inherit the additional burden of enforcing immigration laws -- if cuts_in federal funds stemming from the initiative don ' t eliminate their jobs . Meanwhile , more traditional unionists are comfortable opposing Proposition 187 because it is so closely associated with Gov . Pete Wilson , a politician they regard_as blatantly anti-union . Perhaps the least likely members of the labor coalition are the state ' s building trades_unions , which are opposing Proposition 187 even as they continue calling_for tougher penalties for employing illegal immigrants . Tim Cremins , a lobbyist with the state Building and Construction Trades Council , explained that the measure would do nothing to keep job-seeking illegal immigrants from coming_to California . Cremins acknowledged that many construction workers in California are angry about jobs in the industry being taken by illegal immigrants , but he said the frustration &quot; shouldn ' t be taken_out on innocent people and children &quot; who would be denied non-emergency medical_care and public education . To be sure , the pronouncements of labor_leaders won ' t dictate how the rank_and_file vote . A Los Angeles Times Poll completed last week shows union_members favoring Proposition 187 by a 47 % -43 % margin . Perhaps the most encouraging news from the poll for labor_leaders was that the margin in favor had shrunk sharply from a Times Poll taken earlier in October . In addition , the gap among union_members was narrower than among all likely voters , who favored the measure 51 % to 41 % in the latest poll . While some observers call union leaders courageous for opposing the initiative , others say labor officials aren ' t truly risking antagonizing their members . &quot; A tougher issue for us was gun_control , &quot; said Cremins , referring to labor ' s campaign for Proposition 15 , an unsuccessful state ballot measure in 1982 that would have restricted handgun sales . Over the last two or three decades , many rank-and-file union_members have come_to expect labor_leaders to take positions more liberal than their own and feel no need to vote along union lines . that ' s the case with Waymann C . Carlson , a professor of education at Southern California College in Costa Mesa and a member of an affiliate of the California Teachers Assn . He plans to vote for Proposition 187 because he believes it is wrong for illegal immigrants to receive public_services . Leaders of the CTA , Carlson said , &quot; represent a lot of positions that I don ' t hold . . . . I find myself at_odds with them on political grounds more often than I ' m with them. &quot; For labor_leaders seeking to strengthen the flagging U.S. labor_movement , finding common_ground with the nation ' s growing immigrant communities is a natural strategy . Union leaders &quot; all understand that this is the work_force out there , and these people aren ' t going_back to Mexico , Latin_America or wherever if this thing passes , &quot; said the AFL-CIO ' s Sickler . Winning the membership of illegal immigrant workers themselves -- not just the legal immigrants and others who support their interests -- is a major goal . &quot; If people are working_on a job , it ' s not up_to us to determine what their status is . But it is up_to us to see that they ' re getting a decent wage , if there ' s anything we can do about it , &quot; Sickler said . Sickler maintains that the California labor_movement ' s support of immigrant rights issues has been developing over the last two decades and is reflected in the number of Latinos and Asian Americans rising through the union leadership ranks . Among others , he cited Maria Elena Durazo , president of the largely Latino immigrant Local 11 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union . She is the daughter of Mexican immigrants . Durazo , 41 , still bitterly recalls how her local -- under another administration in the early 1980s -- spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal_fees to fight members who wanted union meetings and newsletters to be translated into Spanish . Today the local conducts business in both Spanish and English , though membership meetings are conducted mainly in Spanish because of the preferences of the rank_and_file . The local also accepts both legal and illegal immigrants as members . Durazo said the aim is to prevent employers from driving down wages by exploiting undocumented workers . &quot; We ' re not going_to play into those games of pitting workers against each other , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
