   <HEADLINE> WASHINGTON OUTLOOK : IMBALANCE OF POWER DEFINES STRUGGLE OVER HEALTH_CARE ; CLINTON NEEDS HELP OF BROAD-BASED MOVEMENTS LIKE LABOR , CIVIL RIGHTS TO COUNTER CONSERVATIVE GAINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Jimmy_Carter had passed labor law reform in 1978 , Bill_Clinton might have a better chance of passing health_care reform in 1994 . Not many in the Clinton_Administration understand that connection , or its implication for their agenda . But if Carter had broken the conservative filibuster that blocked labor law reform 16 years ago last month , the union movement would represent a larger share of the work_force today . With more workers , the unions would have more clout to invest in the fight for Clinton ' s health_care reform when it faces the inevitable conservative filibuster later this year in Congress . &quot; If you had , for instance , a labor_movement representing 30 % to 35 % of the ( private sector ) labor_force instead of 12 % , that kind of base would be a much more potent force in the health_care debate , as well as so many other things the Administration wants to do , &quot; said one ranking Administration official sympathetic to this viewpoint . As both candidate and President , Clinton has rightly sought to demonstrate his independence from labor and other Democratic constituency groups . But those well-publicized disputes with labor over the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , or with civil_rights organizations over the proposed Racial Justice Act , obscure a larger truth . On most issues , especially bread-and-butter economic concerns , those groups push in the same direction as a Democratic President . On Capitol_Hill , he needs them as a counterweight to business and the ideological lobbies hostile to activist government . The left ' s weakness leaves Clinton in an exposed position . On almost all issues -- from health_care to domestic spending -- Clinton has been first over the_hill , leading the charge for government to take_on new responsibilities . But it reverses the pattern of history for the President to take the point . In previous eras of government activism , the driving force has been not the President but broad-based social movements whose insistent demands forced Washington to respond . Today there ' s nothing comparable_to the progressive and Populist movements at the turn_of_the_century that furrowed the ground for the pure food and drug acts and the progressive income_tax ; the incipient labor_movement and share-the-wealth grass-roots uprisings led by Huey P . Long and Francis V . Townsend that helped inspire the Social_Security Act in 1935 , or the civil_rights and consumer movements that powered through the anti-discrimination and environmental laws that cascaded out of Congress from 1964 through 1972 . &quot; The question after Clinton ' s election was what kind of new force was going_to emerge to push the elected officials and the President , and that hasn ' t happened at any level , &quot; one union official says . &quot; The right is_on the ascendancy , the business_community is_on the ascendancy , but the progressive community is not. &quot; That imbalance has defined the lobbying struggle over health_care . So far the decisive thrusts have been the health_insurance industry ' s &quot; Harry and Louise &quot; TV ads and the National Federation of Independent Business ' ferocious mobilization against employer mandates . On paper , the forces behind universal health_care coverage are formidable : the 47 organizations allied in the Health_Care Reform Project , an umbrella lobbying group that claims 65 million members . Last week , the AFL-CIO , the American Assn . of Retired Persons and the American Medical Assn . joined for a new push behind universal insurance coverage . But they have a lot of ground to make_up . As in any faltering campaign , that ' s provoked a lot of finger-pointing . The groups blame the White_House for an unsteady legislative and communication strategy ; some labor officials insist it ' s difficult to motivate the rank-and-file behind a President who crossed them on NAFTA and didn ' t exert much energy when the anti-strikebreaker bill quietly died earlier this month in the Senate . The White_House , and many reform proponents on Capitol_Hill , slap the groups for focusing too_much on_their_own parochial interests and not enough on generating support for an overall package . That narrowness of vision points to the left ' s larger problem . Since the early 1970s , the left ' s capacity to mobilize a mass movement has withered ; today , civil_rights groups , consumer organizations and organized labor function more as Washington pressure_groups than as true conduits to the grass roots . They ' ve become more adept at finessing the regulatory process and filing lawsuits than reaching a broad public audience . &quot; What ' s happened to these interest_groups is what happened to academics : They started to speak only to themselves , &quot; one senior White_House official says . Those groups won ' t fully solve their problems until they rethink their methods and agendas . But some in the Administration hope the imbalance in the health_care fight prompts Clinton to think_about what government can do to help renew the groups aligned with Democrats . Franklin D . Roosevelt offers the most successful precedent in this century for that kind of strategic thinking : By signing the National Labor Relations Act that established workers ' right to collective_bargaining , he jump-started the labor_movement , which then anchored the Democratic majority for the next 30 years . Ronald Reagan displayed a similar sense by irrigating Republican territories in the South and West with rivers of defense spending . There ' s not as much Clinton can do to directly bolster Democratic-leaning groups like consumer organizations or civil_rights groups . At most , says one White_House official , reform of voter registration and campaign finance laws can indirectly boost such groups by diminishing the influence of money in elections , and increasing the importance of grass-roots organizing . For those Democrats interested in an institution-building strategy , the real question is whether Clinton can ( or should ) try to resuscitate labor . There are many reasons for labor ' s long slide over the past 40 years , including its own internal ossification , but one key factor has been the inability of the labor laws to guarantee a fair fight in organizing campaigns : Since the early 1950s , the number of unfair labor practice charges annually filed against employers has increased sixfold , while the percentage of union victories in certification elections has dropped from about 70 % to just under 50 % . Later this year , an Administration-appointed commission led by former Labor_Secretary John T . Dunlop is expected to propose labor law reforms that would toughen enforcement against businesses that use illegal practices -- such_as firing workers -- to discourage organizing . Those recommendations will force Clinton to confront the basic issue : Would Democrats and the average Americans they aim to represent be better_off with a stronger labor_movement ? Former Democratic presidential candidates Hubert H . Humphrey or Walter F . Mondale would have answered that question without hesitation . But some around Clinton are uncertain of organized labor ' s place in a &quot; New Democrat &quot; Party , or for that matter a new workplace of flexible production and joint worker-management committees . Labor , civil_rights and consumer groups harbor comparable doubts about whether Clinton is the best the left can hope for in the Oval Office . Each side in this argument has legitimate grievances with the other . But the lopsided fight over health_care suggests that in a fundamentally conservative climate , the first priority for Clinton and the Democratic base should be finding ways to more effectively bolster each other . The Washington Outlook column appears in this space every_other Monday . Activism ' s Hall_of_Fame During the three previous periods of government activism in this century -- the Progressive Era in the 1990s and the 1910s , the New Deal in the ' 30s and the Great Society in the 1960s -- pressure for Washington to take_on new responsibilities came from broad-based social movements . THREE LEADERS IN THOSE MOVEMENTS William Jennings Bryan : The eloquent Nebraska populist who ran three times for President as a Democrat around the turn_of_the_century . John L . Lewis : Founder of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the nation ' s most-powerful labor_leader in the Depression . Martin_Luther_King Jr. : Led the civil_rights movement that inspired the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts of the mid-1960s .</TEXT>
