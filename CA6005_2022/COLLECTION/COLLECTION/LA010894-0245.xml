   <HEADLINE> SANTA ANITA ; CARDMANIA WILL GET A CHALLENGE IN SAN CARLOS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In two of the last three years , victory in the San Carlos Handicap has signaled success in the Santa Anita Handicap . Farma Way began a four-race Santa Anita winning streak in 1991 with a victory in the seven-furlong San Carlos and culminated the run in the $ 1-million Big ' Cap . Last year , Sir Beaufort completed the same parlay . Trainer David Bernstein would love to continue that trend with The Wicked North . The 5-year-old son of Far North will begin his year against Breeders ' Cup Sprint champion Cardmania and five others in the $ 109 # 900 San Carlos today . If all goes well late this afternoon , owner Philip Hersh ' s horse will be pointed toward Santa Anita ' s richest race . Before the Big ' Cap , there would be a start in either the San Pasqual Handicap at 1 1 / 16 miles on Jan . 22 or the San Antonio Handicap at 1 1 / 8 miles on Feb . 13 . Everything points to a big effort by The Wicked North in the San Carlos . He hasn ' t run since finishing second to Memo in the Smile Handicap on Nov . 6 and has a history of running well after a layoff . The Kentucky-bred has also trained well , capped by a five-furlong workout in 57 1 / 5 on Monday . &quot; He ' s coming_up ( to the San Carlos ) exceptionally well , &quot; Bernstein said . &quot; He needed some time_off after ( the Smile ) because he ' d run two weeks before in the Washington , D.C. , International . With the shipping and everything , he lost some weight . &quot; He ' s put the weight back on and he was feeling really good ( Monday ) . &quot; A winner of five of his 11 starts , The Wicked North ' s only off-the-board finish in his last 10 races was in the D.C. International . He finished seventh of eight in the mile race over a yielding turf course . &quot; It had rained heavily and the course was extremely soft and deep , &quot; Bernstein said . &quot; We ' ve run him twice on off tracks ( he was a distant third behind Bertrando in the slop in the San Fernando ) , and we won ' t do_it again. &quot; The Wicked North has handled nearly everything else he has been asked to do . A winner against 1992 Breeders ' Cup Sprint winner Thirty Slews in the Bing Crosby Handicap last Aug . 1 at Del Mar , The Wicked North will try to do the same to Cardmania , the 7-5 favorite . &quot; Obviously , he won the Breeders ' Cup , so he ' ll be tough , &quot; Bernstein said . &quot; The way I look_at the race , Davy Be Good_will be in front , ( The Wicked North ) will be just off the pace , then we ' ll try to hold_off Cardmania . I would think that would be the scenario. &quot; Winless in his first 10 races of 1993 , Cardmania ended his slump with a 2 1 / 2-length victory in the Ancient Title Handicap , 20 days before he rallied to beat Meafara by a neck in the Breeders ' Cup . If the 8-year-old Cox ' s Ridge gelding does make_it three consecutive victories today , he will become the first 1993 Breeders ' Cup champion to win since that day . Brocco was beaten by Valiant Nature in the Hollywood Futurity and the now-retired Kotashaan was defeated in the Japan Cup . Cardmania , who has only two recorded workouts since Nov . 6 , is winless in five tries at seven furlongs , with two seconds and a third . &quot; He ' s going_to run very well , &quot; trainer Derek Meredith said . &quot; He ' s fit and he ' s training well. &quot; With the scratch of Arrowtown , the other San Carlos starters are Exemplary Leader , who won a turf sprint on opening day ; Portoferraio , who won only one of 14 last year ; Davy Be Good , Charts and Monde Bleu . * The career of Music Merci , a multiple-stakes winner , might be over . Being prepared Tuesday for a possible start in the San Carlos , the 8-year-old gelding suffered pulled ligaments in his right front ankle while working five furlongs . &quot; He ' s comfortable , but his future is indefinite , &quot; trainer Bill Spawr said . Beset by injuries and ailments throughout his career , Music Merci finished sixth in his last race , the Breeders ' Cup Sprint . He has won 12 of 35 and earned $ 1 # 500 , 710 . His stakes victories include the Del Mar Futurity , Illinois Derby , San Rafael Stakes , Malibu Stakes and the Palos Verdes Handicap . * Market Booster , who was eliminated at the start of the Yellow Ribbon Stakes in her American debut , is the high weight at 120 pounds for the $ 111 # 800 San Gorgonio Handicap on Sunday . Now trained by Wayne Lukas , the 5-year-old Green Dancer mare won five of 17 in Europe and has trained well for her first start since finishing ninth in the Yellow Ribbon on Nov . 14 . Chris McCarron will ride . The rest of the entrants for the 1 1 / 8-mile race are Skimble , third behind Flawlessly and Toussaud in the Matriarch ; Gumpher , Dior ' s Angel , Lyin To The Moon , Hero ' s Love , Miss Turkana , Suivi , Miatuschka and Shooting The Moon . Horse_Racing Notes Trainer Wayne Lukas says there continue to be encouraging signs_in the condition of his son , Jeff . &quot; He ' s very definitely still in a coma and it ' s a very , gradual long process , &quot; he said . &quot; But he ' s trying to come_out of it a little bit . He lapses in and out , moving his hands and opening his eyes , but he ' s making_good progress. &quot; Jeff Lukas has been in a coma since being run_down by Tabasco Cat in the Santa Anita stable area on Dec . 15 . Eddie Delahoussaye will begin a five-day suspension Sunday after having been disqualified on Top Of The Sky in Wednesday ' s seventh race . . . . Ron McAnally ended a 22-race slump beginning the meeting when Sun Finger won the fifth race on Friday . . . . Trainer Bob Baffert was fined $ 300 for a medication violation .</TEXT>
