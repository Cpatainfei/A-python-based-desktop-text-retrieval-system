   <HEADLINE> TIRED OF HYPE , JACKSON CHALLENGES LEWIS TONIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some people want to turn the Lennox Lewis-Phil Jackson World Boxing Council heavyweight title fight into another &quot; Rocky IV. &quot; The fighters simply want to get_it_on . While the managers and trainers of Lewis , the defending champion , and Jackson proclaim tonight ' s bout a Britain vs . United States grudge match , the boxers try to ignore the blarney . Fighting for a championship is enough for them . &quot; Words can ' t hurt you , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; It ' s like sticks and stones . It all will happen in the ring , throwing punches. &quot; Lewis , who feels slighted in this country , where Evander Holyfield and , now , Michael Moorer generally have been considered the true heavyweight champion , also leaves the mudslinging to others . &quot; A lot of people are talking_about Michael Moorer and other pretenders , &quot; said the 28-year-old Londoner , who was given the WBC belt when Riddick Bowe , then the undisputed champion , dumped it into a garbage_can in a dispute over a mandatory defense against Lewis . &quot; My focus is Phil Jackson . This is a man to be taken seriously ; he has more knockouts than I have fights . It ' s up_to me to prove myself as the true champion. &quot; On Thursday , Lewis ( 24-0 , 20 knockouts ) weighed in at 235 pounds for the bout that will be refereed by Arthur Mercante of New York . Jackson ( 30-1 , 27 knockouts ) , who at six feet is five inches shorter than Lewis , weighed 217 .</TEXT>
