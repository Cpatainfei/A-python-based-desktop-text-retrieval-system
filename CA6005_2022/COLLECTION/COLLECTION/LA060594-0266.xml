   <HEADLINE> TOPPLING THE MADISON AVENUE GIANTS ; SMALLER , MORE CREATIVE AD_AGENCIES , COMBINED WITH A SMART AUDIENCE , THREATEN THE BIG GUYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than two years ago , Rick Ender , an award-winning creative director with a small advertising_agency in Atlanta , was hired by Madison Avenue ' s largest ad_agency , McCann-Erickson . His mission : To create commercials for what may be the world ' s most famous brand , Coca-Cola . &quot; It was a chance to do something really big , &quot; says the soft-spoken Ender . Or so it seemed at the time . In the months that followed , Ender realized he ' d stepped into advertising hell . Coca-Cola had set_up an agonizing internal competition that pitted McCann-Erickson , its faithful U.S. marketing partner of 40 years , against Michael Ovitz , head of the high-powered Hollywood talent firm Creative Artists Agency . To make matters worse , CAA was clearly winning the battle by the time Ender joined McCann . Worse still , Ender could see why McCann was losing but could do nothing about it . &quot; It was like a maze at McCann-Erickson , &quot; he says . &quot; A lot of bureaucracy , a lot of infighting . The best ideas weren ' t getting through. &quot; Those problems became apparent to the world in February , when Coca-Cola held a press_conference in New York to unveil its slate of Coke Classic commercials for 1994 . After it was over , McCann-Erickson executives must have felt_like the kid in the schoolyard pickup game who is chosen dead-last . Coke executives played 30 commercials for the crowd ; 27 were made by CAA , two by the small Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott -- and just one by McCann-Erickson . By that time , Ender was already gone , having resigned a_couple_of months earlier . He is now running his own small ad_agency back in Atlanta . &quot; I wanted to return to the reason I went_into this business , which was to make_good advertising , &quot; he says . Would he ever consider going_to work for one of the big New York agencies again ? &quot; No , &quot; Ender says emphatically . &quot; Never again. &quot; These days , there are more_than a_few New York advertising people who might want to join Ender in heading for the_hills . Turmoil has become a way_of_life on Madison Avenue . The ad business has lost more_than 13 # 500 jobs in the past three years , clients such_as Coke have been defecting from Madison Avenue , and anxiety has been running high at the large , top-name agencies -- the companies that , for 40 years , helped fuel the economy and shape the popular culture . &quot; The big agencies are becoming dinosaurs , &quot; says Donny Deutsch , head of the lean-and-mean New York upstart agency Deutsch Inc. , which has swiped accounts from the_likes_of Ogilvy &amp; Mather and talent from McCann-Erickson . The threats come from all sides , from clients demanding better results from their advertising ; from imaginative , smaller competitors such_as Deutsch , CAA and regional ad_agencies , all hungry for a piece of the $ 138-billion U.S. advertising pie ; from today ' s television viewer , who appears to be more immune to conventional commercials than ever before , and from new technology , which promises to reinvent the very process of advertising . Madison Avenue ' s troubles began during the economic recession of the late 1980s , immediately following a wave of merger mania that had fattened_up the business . Clients began to trim ad spending and many turned_to cost-effective marketing alternatives , such_as coupons and direct mail . By the early ' 90s , advertising had lost 25 % of its market share to other forms of promotion . &quot; The whole relationship between clients and agencies changed -- marketers began to look_for many different ways to promote , other_than just commercials , &quot; says Philip Guarascio , general_manager of marketing and advertising at General Motors Corp . A blizzard of pink_slips began at the big ad houses in 1990 , and the slump worsened in 1991 , the first year in two decades that U.S. ad spending decreased from the previous year . The effects could be felt beyond New York , at ad_agencies throughout the country ; L.A. ad_agencies have been &quot; in a state of panic the last couple of years , &quot; says Anita Santiago , on the board of directors of the Western States Advertising_Agencies Association Inc. ( though she notes that there ' s &quot; more optimism this year &quot; among L.A. agencies , which may be attributable to a strong first_quarter among the Japanese car_makers that dominate the local ad business. ) And it wasn ' t just ad_agencies that suffered : A ripple effect could be felt throughout the media world as magazines , newspapers and television networks all lost advertising ( about 40 magazines went_out of business during the first two years of the ad slump ) . Though media revenues nationwide also have stabilized and even improved a little in the past year , the pressure on agencies has been unrelenting . Clients have trimmed commission fees to agencies from the longtime standard of 15 % to , in some cases , 10 % or less . And up and down Madison Avenue , those same penny-pinching clients have put their accounts up for review . While Coke was drifting toward Hollywood last year , IBM , Burger King , MasterCard and Volkswagen switched from large to small agencies . A number of other clients , including auto_makers BMW and Isuzu and the computer company NEC , have abandoned New York advertising to work with regional ad_agencies in Boston and San Francisco . &quot; More defections from the big agencies will follow , &quot; predicts industry consultant Richard Roth , who advised Burger King on its account switch . &quot; Client companies are fighting harder than ever for market share , and they need big ideas. &quot; And , with rare exceptions , the big ideas haven ' t been coming from big agencies . Instead , they ' ve been coming from unexpected places . For the past few years the advertising culture has been shaped more by a small agency in Portland , Wieden &amp; Kennedy , urging consumers to &quot; Just Do It &quot; than by any of the multinational , New York-based leviathans . And the top national ad award shows now are dominated by agencies from San Francisco , Minneapolis and Richmond , Va . Companies &quot; basically and fundamentally no longer accept on faith the value of conventional advertising placed in conventional media , &quot; Allen Rosenshine , chairman and CEO of BBDO Worldwide , told the annual meeting of the American Association of Advertising_Agencies last month . The Madison Avenue powerhouses have &quot; finally begun to acknowledge that this isn ' t a recession we ' re in , and that we ' re not going_to go_back to the good old days , &quot; says Keith Reinhard , chairman and CEO of DDB Needham Worldwide , who has seen his agency ' s spacious New York office become a ghost_town as the staff dropped from 1 # 000 to less than 500 . &quot; What ' s become clear , &quot; he says , &quot; is that the problems of big agencies are systemic , and must be dealt with. &quot; Last year , in what some saw as a sign of desperation , several major agencies began to &quot; re-engineer &quot; and restructure themselves , with an emphasis on downsizing . This year , the trend is for slumping agencies to replace top_executives ( in one frantic week in April , three powerhouses , Ogilvy &amp; Mather , Ayer and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi , all named new CEOs or presidents at their New York offices ) . But Deutsch and others in advertising believe that such thrashing about won ' t remedy a fundamental problem : While the big guys were expanding into global giants , he says , they lost touch with their core audience here in America . The late ' 80s and early ' 90s TV viewer -- armed with remote_control , VCR , 50 channels and decades ' worth of media savvy -- became too smart , too quick and too elusive for slow-moving , conventional advertisers . The tumult of the past four years may be nothing compared to what ' s coming . By the time advertising ' s rollicking ' 90s are over , you may_not recognize the commercials on your TV , which are likely to be more interactive , more diverse and more targeted . Lots of people -- including small , creative agencies such_as Deutsch , Hollywood agents and producers , infomercial specialists and video-game mavens -- will be challenging the New York heavyweights such_as McCann-Erickson , whose chief weapon , and weakness , is its own immensity . THE HIGH-RISE , MID-MANHATTAN OFFICES OF MCCANN-ERICKSON , AN agency that creates more_than $ 6.7 billion worth of commercials each year , is a place in which slogans abound . Posted on the walls are nearly 80-year-old inspirational writings by founder Harrison K . McCann about the higher purposes of advertising ( &quot; To create energy out of facts and words . . . to stir desire and impel action &quot; ) . In the creative department , there are small , hand-held mirrors with the words &quot; Creativity is my responsibility &quot; printed on the glass at the bottom of each . And there ' s the agency motto , plastered everywhere you look : &quot; Truth Well Told , &quot; it declares , serving as evidence that advertisers are capable of deceiving themselves , too . John Dooner , the 45-year-old , fast-rising executive who has been president of McCann since 1992 and who will add the title of CEO this summer , also believes_in the power of slogans . Sitting in his plush office , the pinstripe-suited Dooner is asked about his agenda for leading the world ' s top agency into a period that promises to test McCann ' s mettle . He pauses for a moment , then reaches for a small , pre-printed card upon which he has documented his guiding principles . He begins to read from the card , uttering corporate-speak phrases about &quot; the power and passion to be the best. &quot; If Dooner seems to lack spontaneity , he is , in that regard , not entirely out_of_place at McCann-Erickson , an agency that some advertising people call &quot; the factory. &quot; Dooner is charming except in the face of criticism . Then , he tends toward bluntness with a touch of derision . &quot; To talk_about the big agencies being in_trouble is sexy , it makes a good_story , but it ' s bull , &quot; he says , noting that McCann has steadily added_to its accounts , outperforming most of Madison Avenue in the 1990s . ( Last year , it netted $ 450 million in new business , and in seven of the past eight years , it has been ranked among the top five ad_agencies in the world in terms of new U.S. business. ) Still , what of the layoffs at the big agencies and the constant client defections ? &quot; People think advertising is alone with these problems , &quot; he snaps . &quot; It ' s happening everywhere . IBM is laying_off thousands of people ! &quot; And what about Coca-Cola going_to Hollywood for ads ? Dooner begins to answer , then stops himself . No one at McCann-Erickson is supposed to talk_about Coca-Cola and CAA , though in truth , some people in the industry have been talking_about little else . To understand how much Coke ' s romance with CAA hurts McCann , you have to consider history . During a period of five decades , McCann helped build Coke into one of the world ' s premier brands , and conversely , Coke helped build McCann into the top agency . The collaboration occasionally produced advertising magic . Some Coke commercials live_on in viewers ' memories 20 to 30 years later : the chorus on the hilltop , singing &quot; I ' d Like to Teach the World to Sing , &quot; and the fearsome football_player Mean Joe Greene , who hands_over his game jersey to a child . The old slogans , including &quot; Things Go Better With Coca-Cola &quot; and &quot; It ' s the Real_Thing , &quot; were no less memorable . The problem , from McCann and Coke ' s standpoint , is that it is only the 20-year-old commercials that come_to_mind ; try to recall a Coke commercial from the past five years -- pre-Polar Bear , that is -- and chances are you ' ll draw_a_blank . It isn ' t just that the ads have become bland ; more to_the_point , the world around McCann has changed . For years , McCann and other big agencies turned_out &quot; mass-produced , mass-marketed , one-size-fits-all commercials , &quot; says Don E . Schultz , professor of integrated marketing communications at Northwestern University . &quot; But what we ' ve recently discovered is that today ' s consumer is turned_off by that and is saying , ' I ' m not homogeneous , I ' m not like the guy down the street. ' &quot; As viewer attitudes have changed , so , too , have the media , which became more fragmented by cable . &quot; It became harder for commercials to have an impact through sheer repetition , &quot; says Schultz . Or , as Peter Sealey , former global marketing chief at Coca-Cola , puts it : &quot; The days of forcing people to sit through obnoxious ' Ring-Around-the-Collar ' commercials are over. &quot; Sealey , who has since left Coca-Cola to become head of Interactive Network Inc. , a new interactive cable TV broadcast network , was at the center of the soft-drink company ' s decision to radically change its advertising two years ago . Coke had grown weary of &quot; the blandness coming_out of the advertising factories , year after year , &quot; he says . &quot; Every summer , the agency would present me with a commercial of somebody squirting someone else with a hose. &quot; And , says Sealey , McCann-Erickson clung to the traditional practice of creating broad messages for 18-to-34-year-olds , &quot; as if you could run the same ad on MTV as on CBS. &quot; Having previously worked as a president of marketing and distribution at Columbia Pictures , Sealey , along with former Coke president Donald Keough , believed that Hollywood was more in touch with changes in the popular culture than Madison Avenue , and that the Hollywood production system -- which relied_on independent artists rather than in-house talent -- was more conducive to creativity . And so , in early fall of 1991 , Coke signed_up CAA as a global marketing consultant . McCann-Erickson knew that war had been declared and began working feverishly on a new campaign for Coke , with ideas and suggestions being sent to New York from McCann offices around the world . But few ideas survived the agency ' s hierarchical approval process , according to inside sources . Meanwhile on the West Coast , there were only two people working_on Coke full time at CAA -- Len Fink , a former adman from Chiat / Day , and Shelly Hochron , a former senior_vice_president of production at Tri-Star Pictures . Hochron says ideas were being generated daily through &quot; a lot of brainstorming with little or no formal research. &quot; In October of 1992 , on a day that may well have changed advertising forever , the CAA team headed east and the McCann crew headed west for a showdown in a Coca-Cola conference_room in Atlanta . McCann arrived with a handful of ideas that would serve as jumping-off_points for multicommercial campaigns . Agency executives sat and watched as CAA , led by Ovitz , presented its ideas -- more_than 30 of them , for individualized commercials . Says one McCann executive who was there : &quot; I was blown away by the diversity of CAA ' s work . We were coming from the old_school of advertising repetition , which is the way Coke had always done things . And here CAA was , breaking the mold . It was very daring of them . Of course , they had nothing to lose -- unlike us. &quot; Surprisingly , the CAA ads did not resort_to using movie_stars from Ovitz ' s stable ; that would have been standard ad industry point-and-pitch fare . Instead , Hochron says , &quot; our intent was to look completely different -- to be more graphically arresting or unusual than anything else on TV. &quot; To achieve that , CAA wanted to use stylistic film directors and state-of-the-art visual techniques , such_as computer-generated animation . &quot; As soon as we saw what CAA was presenting , we felt it was fresh and compelling , &quot; Sealey says . As the CAA presentation was ending -- before McCann had shown a single idea to Coke -- one McCann executive at the table , John Bergin , slipped a note to another sitting next to him . It read : &quot; We are dead. &quot; But the other executive responded , &quot; No , we ' re not. &quot; It turned_out that Bergin was right . Not only did CAA win the shootout ( 24 CAA ads were approved , compared to two of McCann ' s ) , but its work also seemed to score a hit with the public -- particularly one commercial featuring an animated , herky-jerky polar_bear , which simply looked_like nothing else on TV . Though Sealey was ousted last fall after Coke ' s president retired , any hopes that McCann may have had for reinstatement were dashed when Sergio Zyman , Sealey ' s replacement , selected another full slate of CAA ads earlier this year , some featuring the polar_bear . He announced that the first batch helped increase Coke ' s market share for the first time in years and tapped several regional agencies , including Portland ' s Wieden &amp; Kennedy , Venice ' s Chiat / Day and Minneapolis ' Fallon McElligott to work_on Coke ads . The unspoken message from Coke : If we want fresh ideas , we ' ll have to look beyond Madison Avenue . While it might seem odd that a tiny group of outsiders could sucker punch a global marketing heavyweight like McCann , it demonstrates that good ideas can come from anywhere . An agency ' s success is ultimately dependent_on tiny creative sparks , on the ability of an art_director and a copywriter , sitting in a room together , to find an original , striking way to convey an otherwise banal message . But at McCann and many other big agencies , the ideas that emerge from that room must pass_through a half-dozen or more layers of approval within the agency ' s hierarchy . &quot; Ideas don ' t rise to the top in an environment that massive , &quot; says Ender , who notes that his best schemes for Coke at McCann never saw the light of day . Those ideas that do manage to pass from one layer to the next &quot; get altered and watered_down at each stop ; what you end_up with lacks the freshness of the original idea , &quot; says Bill Oberlander , an award-winning art_director at McCann who is now at the smaller kirshenbaum &amp; bond in New York . McCann ' s top creative director , Marcio Moreira , is keenly aware of the plague of bureaucracy and says he is attempting to reduce the number of &quot; operating levels &quot; at McCann . Its chief , meanwhile , seems less sympathetic . Dooner notes that creative people are paid great sums_of_money -- as much as $ 300 # 000 a year -- to join McCann-Erickson and to perform in the big_leagues . &quot; This is a business we ' re in , and our whole purpose is to be big , &quot; Dooner says . &quot; If you want to be an artist , move to SoHo. &quot; Though Dooner acknowledges that the agency needs more creativity and says he plans to &quot; acquire &quot; more talent to that end , he also contends that there may be too_much creative flash in the kind of advertising that wins awards and strives hard to entertain . &quot; Advertising ' s fundamental purpose is to sell , &quot; he says , adding that &quot; we tend to lose sight of that as viewers and critics of it . Advertising has to provide reasons to purchase. &quot; McCann ' s own commercials put forth those selling propositions in a workmanlike fashion . For L ' Oreal hair coloring , actress Cybill Shepherd gazes into the camera and talks earnestly about the advantages of having beautiful hair ; for Alka-Seltzer , there ' s a bouncy jingle about getting_through a tough day ( &quot; Get Yourself Some Alka-Seltzer / And You ' ll Feel Better Fast ! &quot; ) . The production values are flawless , the jingles are even a little catchy . Ten years ago , McCann ' s brand of functional advertising -- supported by a big media budget and a lot of repetition -- was more_than adequate . But that was before channel-surfing and remote-control mute buttons came_along and put advertisers under_the_thumb_of the average couch potato . Today , says Northwestern ' s Schultz , advertisers must find ways to attract a viewer &quot; who is no longer captive , &quot; and that necessitates taking creative risks -- an uncommon practice at agencies such_as McCann , but a way_of_life at Deutsch . A FEW MONTHS AGO , DONNY DEUTSCH WAS SITTING IN HIS DOWNTOWN New York office , with its indoor basketball_hoops and miniature pinball_machine , when members of his creative team brought him an idea for Ikea furniture stores , a client . The plan was to show a live-in couple shopping for furniture . Nothing unusual there -- except that this couple would be composed of two men . Deutsch thought_about it for a moment ; no one , to his knowledge , had done a gay-lifestyle network TV commercial for a mainstream company . That made_it all_the more appealing . &quot; It just felt right in my gut , &quot; he says . Subsequently , there were no review meetings , no research sessions ; Deutsch took the idea straight to the client , who approved it . As the commercial , which showed the two men joking with one another about the act of buying furniture and its implications for long-term personal_relationships , began airing in April , it generated a large splash of publicity . Ikea ' s investment in the ad was multiplied many times over by free exposure in the media . Clients are usually surprised when this happens , but not Ikea -- it ' s used to the way Donny Deutsch works . If there ' s any ad_agency in New York that could be said to have been designed for the early 1990s -- a time when consumers are tuning out sales pitches and responding only to that which seems startling and authentic -- it may be Deutsch , run_by the irrepressible , 36-year-old Donny Deutsch . While much of New York advertising has been starving for attention and clients , Deutsch has had no shortage of either . In the past two years , Prudential Securities , Lenscrafters opticians , Tanqueray gin , Hardee ' s fast-food chains and a half-dozen other clients -- totaling $ 200 million in new business and bringing the overall billings of Deutsch ' s agency to $ 300 million -- have joined Deutsch . They did so primarily because the agency ' s commercials &quot; break_through and reach people on a gut level , &quot; says Deborah Callahan , Tanqueray ' s vice_president , product group director . that ' s not to say the gut feeling you get from a Deutsch ad will necessarily be pleasant . In fact , some of the agency ' s commercials border_on the offensive . One , for Pontiac cars , took a swipe at growing Japanese ownership in America with a snide reference_to New York ' s Rockefeller Center as &quot; Mitsubishi Center. &quot; Other Deutsch ads have poked_fun at American icons such_as Disney World and Nike sneakers ( &quot; Your mother wears Nike , &quot; cried one Deutsch ad for a competing shoe , British Knights , in an attempt to plant the kiss of sneaker death -- uncoolness -- on the top brand ) . Stylistically , Deutsch ' s advertising is practically the antithesis of that produced by McCann-Erickson . Where McCann ' s ads are smooth and polished , Deutsch ' s are rough around the edges -- usually shot on a low budget , starring quirky &quot; real people &quot; instead of professional actors . In place of jingles and sales pitches , there is seemingly spontaneous dialogue and action , so that some ads resemble a documentary more_than a commercial . Sly humor is usually a central element , and the commercials ' subjects are often the recipients of Deutsch ' s darts . The company helped introduce the concept of Ikea , a self-serve furniture store with few salespeople or deliverers , by filming_clips of other stores ' salespeople , who spouted inane pitches , and their deliverymen , who took seemingly endless breaks . &quot; Who needs these guys ? &quot; the commercials asked viewers . Deutsch ' s &quot; reality-style &quot; advertising is seen by some in the business as a gimmick , but Deutsch contends that most consumers today grew_up bombarded by TV commercials and &quot; can ' t be fooled by the old 30-second song-and-dance. &quot; They want their TV &quot; raw and real , &quot; he says , as evidenced by the success of &quot; Roseanne , &quot; &quot; Seinfeld &quot; and &quot; Court TV. &quot; Like those programs , his advertising strives to &quot; hold_up a mirror , &quot; he says . Yet the mirror Deutsch holds_up reflects what he wants you to see . In fact , it could be argued that Deutsch ' s advertising , which simulates reality better than conventional commercials , is , in fact , a more subtle form of dishonesty . The agency scours malls and playgrounds for quirky &quot; real people , &quot; then coaches them for maximum authenticity . People are sometimes recorded speaking off-the-cuff for extended periods_of_time , then their comments are edited down to make a commercial that only seems spontaneous . It ' s cynical advertising for a cynical generation of TV viewers . And Deutsch isn ' t the only one doing_it . Nike ' s agency , Wieden &amp; Kennedy , mastered the art of faux honesty several years ago ; it trashed the sales pitch and began speaking &quot; candidly &quot; to viewers , acknowledging with a wink that Nike shoes don ' t really enable you to jump like endorser Michael Jordan . More recently , New York ' s kirshenbaum &amp; bond has also taken a &quot; realistic &quot; approach in its tongue-in-cheek , documentary-style ads for Snapple soft_drinks , featuring offbeat Snapple customers . &quot; These ads are an admission to viewers that most advertising has no credibility , &quot; says Anthony Vagnoni , editor of Creativity , a spinoff by Advertising Age . &quot; They ' re attempting to stand apart , to ring true amid all those commercials that seem so false. &quot; ( According to a recent survey in Adweek magazine , consumers are more jaded about ads than ever , with only 34 % of respondents saying they trust ads ; among the 18-24 set , only 23 % trust ads ) . Moreover , Vagnoni says , such commercials are attempting to engage in a new &quot; smart dialogue &quot; with cynical viewers . What sets_apart the advertising of Deutsch and other rising-star agencies ( including kirshenbaum &amp; bond , Wieden &amp; Kennedy and San Francisco ' s Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners ) is not so_much a particular style as an approach -- one that soft-sells and relies_on wit and ingenuity . The tactic is clearly working for Deutsch Inc. , which has more_than tripled in size since Donny , who began his career as a disillusioned account_executive at Ogilvy &amp; Mather , took the reins at his father ' s small , 20-year-old agency . The outspoken Deutsch is not well-loved by his peers , who have dubbed him &quot; Madonny. &quot; With his touches of artifice ( born and bred on the streets of Queens , he is never seen without his cowboy_boots ) , his tendency to boast ( &quot; we ' re the only agency in the business that truly balances creativity and sound strategy , &quot; he claims ) , and his insatiable appetite for attention ( when told he ' d be in this story , Deutsch immediately asked : &quot; Is it a cover story ? &quot; ) , Deutsch ' s personality sometimes combines the worst elements of advertising . Beneath the bluster , he has what one former employee describes as &quot; a terrific , natural instinct for picking ideas &quot; that resonate with the public . And having never had the luxury of Madison Avenue ' s big-budget campaigns , Deutsch has learned how to make the most of minimal access to consumers . His enticing commercials , for now at least , represent the better mousetrap that Madison Avenue seems to need . For all_of those cutting-edge tendencies , however , the agency of the moment may_not necessarily be the agency of the future . Deutsch must contend not only with its own growth pains ( internal pressures led Deutsch ' s business partner , Steve Dworin , to resign earlier this year ) , but also with changes in advertising for which even his agency seems ill-prepared . For instance , when the loquacious Donny is asked about interactive advertising , a miracle occurs : He is at_a_loss for words . &quot; THINK OF A MAN ON A FLYING TRAPEZE , &quot; SAYS DDB NEEDHAM ' S REINHARD . &quot; Right now , the ad business is between trapezes . It ' s scary , because we don ' t even know what the world of advertising is going_to look_like in a_few years. &quot; We have a_few clues , however . This year , Time Warner will begin an interactive television test in Orlando , Fla. , while a similar interactive TV test program is being launched by AT &amp; T and Viacom in Castro Valley , Calif . Viewers in these test markets will be equipped with an interactive TV channel through which they can order entertainment , information , services -- and advertising . Why would anyone request advertising ? For a payoff . Companies on these channels will offer incentives to entice you to watch their long-form commercials . They may provide you with discounted or free merchandise , or they may offer a different kind of swap : If you watch our ad , we ' ll let you watch a TV_program that we own . Once you agree to watch an interactive ad from , say a car_company , here ' s what you might see : The ad opens with a showroom full of cars . Using a point-and-click device , you point to one of the cars ; a short video clip comes_on , showing the car in action . Then the ad begins to ask you questions . Do you want to know more about the car ' s gas mileage ? Would you like to hear from a_few satisfied customers ? Just push a button and the appropriate clip pops_up . At the end of the process , a brochure or a rebate coupon spews out of the printer beside your TV ( with lower-priced products , you ' ll be able to place an order if you like ) . Time Warner expects to roll_out its network nationwide in about five years . That may be optimistic , considering that there have been some start-up delays , but there ' s little doubt that interactive TV is , as Chrysler marketing director Jim Julow says , &quot; on its way , and coming_in a hurry. &quot; Already , the first generation of interactive ads can be seen on some home computer_screens , with on-line networks such_as Prodigy running ads that enable users to click on their computer_screen for detailed information from advertisers . As computers and TVs converge in the new media world , this simple interaction will become more visually stimulating and more sophisticated . It also will , says Bruce Judson , Time Inc. ' s general_manager of multimedia products and services , &quot; irrevocably change the relationship between marketers and consumers. &quot; The reason is simple . For perhaps the first time in ad history , the viewer will be in control , deciding which ads they want to see , then navigating through them . Advertisers , in turn , will have to create ads differently . &quot; Instead of trying to bombard you with a slogan , we ' ll have to figure_out what kind of information you really want and how to present that information in stages , to lead you through the process , &quot; says Peter Farago of New York ' s Farago Advertising , which will be making ads for a client in the Time Warner interactive test . Ideally , if old commercials were like bad salesmen screaming a canned pitch at you , pushing the same product on everybody , new ads may be more like good salesmen who listen and respond to individual needs . Marketers are excited about the prospect of interactive ads because they promise to bring more accountability to advertising . They will be_better able to see -- from your responses and your orders -- which pitches and promotions succeed . In some cases , they may even quiz you to see if you remember a particular slogan , rewarding you with prizes . It seems the only people who aren ' t eager for interactive advertising are the large ad_agencies , to whom it represents &quot; yet another threat to the established way of doing things , &quot; says Farago , formerly of J . Walter Thompson . To its credit , McCann-Erickson has begun taking the lead , along with Ogilvy &amp; Mather , in bringing interactive technology to Madison Avenue . About six months ago , McCann formed an interactive division , and in April named a top creative director , Marshall Karp , to help develop interactive ads . ( McCann has also sponsored a number of interactive TV field tests. ) But other major agencies have yet to take these first_steps . &quot; With their profit_margins so slim , I don ' t think agencies believe they can afford to take the lead_on interactivity , &quot; says advertising consultant Fred Lemont , of New York ' s Grammercy Marketing Corp . &quot; But it ' s also partly denial : In the past , agencies underestimated the impact of VCRs and cable , too . They want to stay in the simple world of three networks. &quot; Martin Nisenholtz , who runs Ogilvy &amp; Mather ' s decade-old interactive marketing group on Madison Avenue , says most agencies &quot; are taking an ostrich-like , hands-off position about new media technology . They ' re not even coming_to the table . Meanwhile , a lot of small , entrepreneurial companies outside the agency community are looking_for ways to get a piece of this business. &quot; Indeed , the new_world of advertising may be open_to all kinds of ambitious outsiders . Aubrey Balkind , of the New York ad_agency Frankfurt Balkind Partners , points_out that the design of interactive ads could offer opportunities for video-game creators , who are used to working in a quick-response medium . Meanwhile , creators of entertainment programming may have an edge , too , because &quot; the distinctions between advertising and programming will continue to blur , &quot; Balkind says . Is that a Chrysler-sponsored show you ' re watching , or is it an infomercial , or just a long-form commercial ? It ' ll get harder and harder to tell the difference , experts say . In an interactive , hundred-channel world , it will also be increasingly critical to target ads to narrow demographic groups . &quot; Where a client once needed three commercials , they ' ll now need 30 , &quot; says Balkind . And they ' ll want to backstop those commercials with specific sophisticated promotions such_as &quot; peer-group-influencer programs , &quot; wherein a company pays people to go_to a trendy place and talk up a particular product . &quot; Marketing is going_to become more and more complex , more specialized , &quot; says GM ' s Guarascio . In such a complex , specialized world , what is the role of the ad_agency ? that ' s the hundred-billion-dollar question being asked on Madison Avenue . Dooner thinks he has_the_best chance of succeeding in this changing world , because his company ' s vast resources and far-flung empire ( McCann-Erickson has offices in 99 countries ) can provide a global Wal-Mart for marketers in the midst of the chaos . Dooner repeats the word global like a mantra . &quot; The future of advertising is all headed toward multinational and global , &quot; he says , leaning over at one point to confide , &quot; The U.S. is just the tick on the dog ' s ass. &quot; And it is true that so far , at least , most of the multinational brands have stuck_with big agencies , if only because &quot; it ' s a place to park all_of their global business and not worry about it , &quot; says consultant Roth . &quot; It ' s too_much of a headache to have to deal with different agencies in different countries. &quot; Big agencies provide other benefits , too . Since they buy advertising space in great bulk , they can negotiate for lower rates from the media . But those advantages notwithstanding , creativity in advertising -- the Achilles ' heel for many of the big agencies -- could become increasingly important to the multinational clients , particularly if big-brand awareness continues to erode here at_home . In the past few years , more consumers have opted for discounted , private-label brands . To reverse that trend , &quot; companies like General Foods will have to come_around to creative agencies eventually , &quot; Deutsch says . A number of big agencies seem to share that view . In the past year , DDB Needham , Lintas and other big agencies have broken_off pieces of themselves to form small , creative spinoff agencies -- initiating a kind of merger mania in reverse . It ' s possible Dooner and Deutsch may both be wrong . GM ' s Guarascio foresees a future in which agencies of all sizes -- and maybe even interlopers such_as CAA or interactive technology specialists -- might simultaneously serve the same client . &quot; The big agencies have an opportunity to become the general contractor , &quot; he says . &quot; As we turn_to various specialists , who ' s going_to manage all_of that ? The big agency -- if it can change its mind set_about ownership. &quot; Guarascio says the large ad houses must stop trying to do what they don ' t do_well . &quot; They can ' t out-special the specialist , &quot; he says . Ironically , Guarascio ' s theory seems to suggest that Dooner operate more like a Mike Ovitz , finding the best outside talent for each particular task at_hand . That might necessitate McCann and other big agencies parceling_out various parts of the advertising process . For example , the few big agencies that do manage to consistently produce highly creative advertising , such_as New York ' s BBDO Advertising , might relinquish research or other services . Such a metamorphosis , if it ever does come_to advertising , would doubtless bring more layoffs and general Angst to Madison Avenue . But on the bright_side , it might mean that an agency such_as McCann-Erickson could someday return to a Rick Ender , in his small , creative shop in Atlanta , and ask him to do what he does best , just to make a good ad . Says Ender , echoing a Coke jingle from bygone days , &quot; that ' s the way it should be. &quot;</TEXT>
