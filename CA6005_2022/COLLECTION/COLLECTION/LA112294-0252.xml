   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ENACTS FINAL POLITICAL REFORM LAWS ; ASIA : THE LEGISLATION CREATES 300 SINGLE-SEAT PARLIAMENT DISTRICTS . CHANGES AIMED AT PRODUCING A TWO-PARTY SYSTEM , CUTTING CORRUPTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Concluding a six-year struggle under seven prime_ministers , Japan ' s Parliament on Monday voted into law the final pieces of political reforms designed to produce a two-party system , campaigns fought on policy issues rather than pork-barrel handouts and periodic changes of government . Socialist Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama , however , said the vote marked &quot; just the start of political reform. &quot; The form of &quot; a saint has emerged but it has no soul yet . We must transform ( the laws ) into a force that will restore the people ' s confidence ( in politics ) , &quot; he said . Three bills drawing boundaries for 300 single-seat lower house districts , stiffening penalties for vote buying and fixing qualifications of parties eligible to share $ 309 million in government campaign subsidies passed the upper house in a nearly unanimous vote . The subsidies , equal_to $ 2.50 for each voter , will be given to parties for the first time in_proportion_to their holdings in Parliament , in the hope of reducing corruption stemming from reliance upon donations from special_interest groups . Coupled with reforms passed in March under former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa , the new laws , which go_into effect Dec . 25 , will end a 70-year-old system of multi-seat districts with an average of four representatives , some of whom polled less than 20 % of the total vote . Two hundred other seats will be filled through a proportional_representation system , in which voters cast a second ballot for the party of their choice . Spurred by a 1988-89 stocks-for-favors scandal that tainted all_of the leaders of the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party , efforts to carry_out reform were thwarted repeatedly until an intraparty rebellion deprived Japan ' s perennial rulers of their 38-year grasp on power and brought a reform coalition under Hosokawa to power in August , 1993 . Even then , rebels within the ranks of Hosokawa ' s supporters once again defeated reforms in an upper house vote_in January . A last-minute compromise , however , won Liberal Democrat support and brought_about enactment in March . Bills passed Monday filled_in the details of those laws . When the new electoral_system will be put to a test remains unknown . Former Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata called_for elections early next year , but Murayama said he was not thinking_of dissolving the lower house , whose term runs_through July , 1997 . Under the new system , the next election is certain to create an upheaval . NHK , the semi-governmental radio and TV network , reported that politicians belonging_to the Liberal Democrat , Socialist and Harbinger parties in Murayama ' s coalition already are battling each other in unofficial campaigning in 131 of the 300 new single-seat districts . Forty-eight of those battles pit Liberal Democrats against Liberal Democrats . Members of eight parties that supported the former coalition governments of Hosokawa and Hata -- who have pledged to form a single unified opposition group Dec . 10 -- are doubled_up against each other in 44 districts , NHK said . As a result of the intense competition , major aims of the reforms -- to slash electioneering costs and to force one-on-one battles focusing_on party policy -- appeared unlikely to be realized . Commentators predicted that at least two or three elections would be needed to reduce the current field of more_than a dozen parties to two major groups , each capable of running a government -- if indeed a weeding-out proves possible . Already , 40 rebels in the ranks of Murayama ' s own Socialists have declared their intention to set themselves apart from the Liberal Democrats and the Hosokawa-Hata group -- both of which are conservative blocks -- by establishing a third &quot; liberal force. &quot; Such a rebellion would deprive the Murayama coalition of a majority in the lower house . A walkout of that scope , however , was unlikely . In July , Murayama abandoned more_than four decades of Socialist pacifist ideology , declaring Japan ' s armed forces constitutional and supporting the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty . Since then , both the ruling coalition and the opposition have been struggling to find new policies with which to distinguish themselves in appealing_to voters .</TEXT>
