   <TEXT> Former President Richard Nixon had tea with Russia ' s dismissed former vice_president , Alexander V . Rutskoi , on Monday and urged the leader of last October ' s bloody rebellion in Moscow on to better things . &quot; Good_luck to you and good_luck to your boys , &quot; Nixon told Rutskoi , who was jailed for inciting a crowd to attack a Moscow television_station in October , triggering fighting that killed at least 147 people . Rutskoi and other leaders of the rebellion were released from prison nine days ago after Russia ' s new conservative Parliament granted them an amnesty . President Boris N . Yeltsin tried -- but failed -- to keep them from being set_free . Yeltsin is expected to see Nixon later this week . Nixon , who arrived in Moscow this week on his 10th visit here , is seeking a meeting with Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , the Russian ultranationalist leader . A spokesman for Nixon said the former President spoke with President Clinton last week about his intention to arrange a meeting with Zhirinovsky , whose party placed first in Russia ' s parliamentary elections in December . Clinton refused to meet with Zhirinovsky during his visit here in January , and senior U.S. officials have been instructed to stay clear of the extremist , who has espoused aggressively nationalistic views . Nixon and Rutskoi posed for photographs in Rutskoi ' s home , and Nixon said afterward that they had discussed relations between their countries . Earlier , Nixon met with lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky at the Russian Parliament . No details of their meeting were available .</TEXT>
