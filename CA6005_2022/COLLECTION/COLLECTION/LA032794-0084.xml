   <HEADLINE> SLOW BOAT THROUGH CHINA ; CRUISING UPSTREAM IN THE THREE GORGES REGION OF THE FABLED YANGTZE_RIVER , PAST MISTY SCENERY THAT MAY BE DOOMED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If this river ran past nothing but 3 # 900 miles of low , lumpy hills and muddy banks , it would still be an unsurpassed wonder . It stretches farther than any others but the Nile and the Amazon , and lies so wide in some stretches that Marco Polo lost credibility when he reported to the Europeans that a man could stand on one shore and not see the opposing bank . On or near the Yangtze ' s edges , more_than 350 million people reside -- a third of China ' s population and , roughly , one in every 15 human_beings on the planet . The river ' s tortured , silt-brown path is strewn with sampans , barges and ferries carrying coal , fruit , rocks , cows and people in very nearly unthinkable volumes . It ' s the world ' s longest Main_Street . In the slow_lanes , amid litter , swim rare dolphins . On the shoulders perch ancient pagodas . At one end lies the East_China_Sea ; at the other , Tibet . But the Yangtze ' s banks do not stay low and lumpy for long . Follow the river upstream from its wide , commerce-choked mouth near Shanghai , and it rises from broad plains to terraced hills dotted with straw-hatted peasants whose farms tilt at what seem like 45-degree angles . Then come dense , grimy towns and a rusting , overloaded ferry . The sound of chisels breaking rock on shore rings across the water . Then , in the Yangtze ' s middle reaches , a mist descends . When it thins , the river has evolved again and the brown currents now mediate a staring match between stone-faced canyon walls . A thousand feet high . Two thousand , with ancient inscriptions etched in the rock and 2 # 000-year-old coffins wedged into caves 1 # 000 feet up . Throughout a 125-mile stretch known as Three Gorges , the Yangtze gathers gaping Westerners in ant-like congregations on the Astroturf decks of their cruise_ships . Here , however , is where the trouble starts . Over the next two decades , if China ' s leaders have their way , a 600-foot-high dam will rise amid the Three Gorges . The river ' s currents , newly harnessed , are to generate more hydro-electric power than any dam in history , reducing the dependence on inefficient coal-burning that has cursed much of China with abysmal air quality . For more_than 350 miles above the dam , water_levels will rise as much as 300 feet , forcing an estimated 1.2 million villagers to relocate , putting countless ancient villages and landmarks under water . These plans have set_off a round of international debate over environmental risk , energy policy and the right of industrialized nations such_as the United States to meddle in China ' s affairs . The pleasant irony here for Chinese tourism officials is that while those arguments resound and the earthmovers begin their scraping , a trickle of Western tourism on the Yangtze is growing_into something like a torrent : Show us thirsty Americans a jeopardized natural wonder and a deadline , and we ' ll come running . Twenty years ago , the story goes , there was one fancy cruise_ship here , and Chairman Mao Tse Tungwas its only customer . By last year , 19 cruise_ships were catering to international travelers , most of the ships operating from early spring to late fall , carrying passengers on journeys of three to five days through the Three Gorges between Wuhan and Chongqing . This year , Chinese officials say , there are 35 . By most accounts , the conditions aboard even the most luxurious of these cruise vessels are suited more to adventurers than comfort-seekers . But the dam deadline seems to have done more for tourism than any ad_campaign could have , and these days the Yangtze stands alongside Beijing , Shanghai , Xian and Guilin as among the top stops on Chinese itineraries . I booked onto one of the last departures of the fall 1993 season , a four-night October excursion that would run westward against the river ' s current . ( Downstream voyages usually take a day less and cost a bit more. ) I flew to Tokyo , then to Hong Kong , and then to the industrial city of Wuhan , about 700 miles upriver from Shanghai , where my prearranged guide never materialized and I spent my first two hours staring through a taxi window at the back_end of a blue dump_truck . For miles we crawled past gray , huddled buildings and gray , huddled people . That night in the bar of the Yangtze Hotel , two British engineers asked my mission and then advised me to expect , as I made my way upriver , the occasional floating human corpse . Thus briefed , I rose early the next morning , inched by cab to the waterfront and climbed aboard the Yangtze Paradise . The first pleasure of a westbound Yangtze cruise is that no matter what else might happen , you ' re out of Wuhan . The next pleasure , for me , was realizing I was the first passenger aboard , free to snoop . While crew_members mopped and scrubbed the halls of the 285-foot-long ship -- then tossed the trash overboard into the river their customers had come_to admire -- I wandered . Though just 2 1 / 2 years old , the ship looked_at least 10 . My single cabin was a tidy cubicle with a 180-degree view of the river , a private balcony , a rust-stained and wrinkled carpet , a tiny desk , a toilet and shower . The swimming_pool on the top deck was dry , and remained so for the next five days . A few paces to the fore , someone had laid_out a mini-golf course , which also remained idle . It fell to the cruise director , an earnest , adept , multilingual 25-year-old named Ben Chen , to reconcile 63 American passengers , and 67 others from points all around Asia , to these circumstances . He did quite well , considering . The ship ' s dining_room offered Western breakfasts to those of us who wanted them , but otherwise stuck_to a satisfying range of Chinese fare : fried shrimp , sweet-and-sour pork , mushrooms , cucumbers , various greens , dumplings , cabbage , rolls . In the bar , a karaoke video machine had been installed . In the playroom stood a massive billiards table , balls subject_to rearrangement with every strong swell of the river . The river : Barges and sampans , sliding past low on the water . No corpses . Apartment_buildings and industrial sites towering and groaning on the banks . The dense order of green row crops . And haze , enduring even through the warm midday hours . Later , when clouds crowded in , the sky seemed murky as the silty water below . Even for a fresh pair of eyes , the boatmen in straw_hats and the yellow-green pallor of barge-top orange shipments all resolved into workaday melancholy . An hour on the Yangtze here , and a stranger can take it for granted . But it ' s all a matter of luck -- the same stranger might then glance to shore and glimpse the outline of two men with a water_buffalo and acres to plow before they sleep , a 1 # 000-year-old profile . &quot; It ' s more_than just the river , &quot; said veteran China tour guide Johanna Koeleman-Walk a_few minutes later on the observation deck . &quot; This is really the only way most tourists can get_out to see the countryside. &quot; * Day two . In a chill wind on the top deck , Ben Chen led a dozen hardy Americans in a beginners ' round of tai chi chuan . Three-and-a-half hours later , we docked at Shashi , a bustling , muddy , textile-producing town of 400 # 000 , which is immediately neighbored by a 2 # 100-year-old canal and the smaller historic town of Jingzhou . In Shashi ' s regional museum , we filed through dimly lit rooms and peered at ancient jade carvings , pre-Christian enamel work , a 2 # 300-year-old example of silk brocade work and a remarkably well-preserved corpse , now pickled in formaldehyde , believe to have been buried in 167 BC . We prowled beneath the tiled_roofs of a calligraphy museum . We climbed the Jingzhou City Wall , which historians believe was built about 700 BC . And we evaded &quot; the artistic waxworks &quot; -- a new tourist attraction that announced itself with a boombox blaring Asian rock . China ' s changes have already reached far beyond its principal cities . We also ate lunch , with varying degrees of satisfaction , at local restaurants . Dining_in ignorance , I was perfectly happy with my pork , vegetables , rolls and rice . Fellow_traveler Terry Halberg , who works for the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture in Washington , D.C. , peeked into the kitchen and returned to his table reluctant to eat anything but the steaming soup . He resolved to do no more kitchen inspections for the rest of the cruise , and was fine . ( Others among the American cruisers proved less adaptable . When dining out_in the province of Sichuan , home of one of the most famously spicy cuisines on the planet , several Americans loudly complained that their dishes were entirely too hot . The Chinese were too polite to throw them in the river. ) By 10 p.m. on the second night , almost all_the Americans were asleep in their cabins , and a tour group from Taiwan had taken_over the karaoke machine in the lounge . One of the ship ' s employees stepped_up to croon a note-perfect version of Frank Sinatra ' s &quot; My Way. &quot; Several couples danced the cha-cha . Outside , the crew played spotlights along the water ' s edge , rough contours began to rise , and a new riverscape took_shape . * In the dark , misty and early hours of Day Three , steep slopes began to rise on either side of the ship , some rock-faced , others sculpted into terraced crops . Then , directly ahead , our spotlights fixed on a wall of concrete . This was the first lock of the Gezhouba Dam , completed about five years ago as a sort of smaller-scale dress_rehearsal for the Three Gorges dam . Local authorities say the Gezhouba project forced relocation of 200 # 000 local residents and has raised water_levels 70 feet in some areas , providing power , smoothing navigation in formerly perilous passages of the river and stabilizing river flows . An hour or two after our arrival there , having waited our turn among a dozen large and small vessels and then edged our way through the locks into the higher_water , we came_to the beginning of the river ' s marquee attractions : Xiling Gorge , 47 miles long , 1 # 000 or so feet deep near its eastern end , and until the opening of Gezhouba Dam , the gorge most feared by boatmen . While we glided beneath the rocky green-and-gray slopes and the morning light slowly gained strength , a hawk tracked us from above . The scene was reminiscent_of Yosemite , robed in mist , robbed of its waterfalls , the symmetry of Half Dome scrambled , the valley half-flooded . At a bend in the river , the wooden skeleton of an unlucky old ship lay lodged and splintered between sharp rocks . Amid all that , the site of the new dam project a_few miles upstream seemed downright piddling . On an island called Zhongbao , heavy equipment had dragged the ground bare , and a neighboring town teemed with workers facing a profoundly odd job : If they do their work properly , their town will disappear forever beneath about 300 feet of water . Chinese leaders , who formally embraced the project in 1992 , say thousands of rural residents have been relocated already . The government forecasts that the dam ' s power potential could mean 40 million fewer tons of coal to burn each year . But realistically , the future of the project is no easier to see than the misty peaks of gorges on a gray day . Cost estimates reach as high as $ 30 billion . Financing from the World_Bank , thought by some to be vital for the project , is far from assured . The death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping , said to be 89 and ailing , could radically change the nation ' s political landscape , as could the country ' s hurtling economic expansion and liberalization . * At Badong , beyond Xiling Gorge , we debarked , scrambled onto buses , then found ourselves prisoners in the chase scene of an IMAX movie . Outside the windows of our careening bus lay 2 # 500-foot slopes , terraced and planted in rich green crops from top to bottom . A stone house here , a curl of smoke from a chimney there . Three children up the road , straggling home from their country school . The dirt road , 30 miles long , had only been cut two years before . It led through one-lane passages , across deep puddles , around blind corners and down steep hills . Sitting_up front , I watched the driver kill the ignition on the downhill stretches , presumably to save gas . I never asked ; I didn ' t want to distract him . At the end of the road came a 400-step descent to Shennong Stream , a deep , narrow Yangtze tributary that , until the building of the road , was the principal commuter artery among the hamlets of the area . It remains a commuter artery , but it ' s also a stop for fortunate foreigners on the Yangtze . Down I stepped , while those uninterested in negotiating the 400 steps paid $ 6 or so to be carried in thrones by pairs of local young_men . At the bottom , the boatmen of Shennong stood smoking in the shallows . Each of the sampans held 17 travelers and was propelled by four or five boatmen who pushed , pulled and poled the vessel across stones in shallow water , delicately guiding us between narrow gorges , through emerald pools , past delicately balanced boulders . Soon the only sound was rushing water , panting boatmen and racing motor-driven camera mechanisms . The boatmen brandished steel-tipped bamboo poles , wore Speedo-style briefs and wrung_out their shirts and sweaters during calm passages . The sampan voyage covered eight miles and about three hours and brought even the laziest throne occupant into an intimacy with the landscape that was impossible from the ship . By the time the Shennong emptied into the Yangtze and we returned to ship , light was fading . Most cruises for foreigners now offer either the Shennong side trip or a small_boat trip_up &quot; Lesser Three Gorges &quot; of the Daning River a_few miles west , and the occasion is often a highlight . On the morning after our small-craft excursion , 74-year-old Paul Bergquist of Saddle River , N.J. , a traveler who has seen Alaska , Europe , Australia , Africa and South_America , pronounced the sampan journey &quot; one of the best days of my life. &quot; * The second gorge on the upriver route is Wu , also known as Witches Gorge . We reached it early on Day 4 , and stood squinting on deck , trying to distinguish among the dozen peaks that tower over its 25-mile length . Goddess Peak . Ascending Dragon . Wise_Man Springs . Congregated Immortals . Reaching more_than 2 # 000 feet above us , some amounted to faint lines in the mist . The last gorge , Qutang , slipped past later that day , the narrowest of the three and the shortest , at about five miles long . &quot; Look one direction , and you ' re in Bryce , &quot; said Rod Zook , an amateur photographer from Seattle . &quot; Look another , you ' re in Yosemite . Another , you ' re in the Grand Canyon. &quot; The gorges were certainly spectacular enough for me , and they seemed to be enough for those who stood alongside me craning their necks , juggling their still and video cameras and gently cursing the same dim , misty light that gave the scenes such gravity . But these gorges , I gather , don ' t do_it for everybody . From the Lonely Planet guidebook : &quot; Don ' t expect to be dwarfed by mile-high cliffs ! A lot of people find the trip quite boring , possibly because of over-anticipation. &quot; Another newspaper correspondent , who took the same ship five months before I did , found the Three Gorges region &quot; certainly scenic , but not so spectacular that I would advise someone to travel halfway around the world to see it. &quot; Maybe the problem here is people . For all its epic dimensions , the Yangtze_River is not one of those natural wonders , like the Grand_Canyon , that seem impervious to human presence . Country hovels and filthy cities intrude at its edges . Farmers traipse up the slopes . Cruise_ships ply and pollute the water . For strictly aesthetic appeal , a traveler is probably better off about 500 miles to the south , among the curvaceous peaks along the Li River near Guilin . You could say , entirely accurately , that the middle Yangtze is an impure , melancholy place . You could also say it ' s the place where , right now , the planet ' s most populous nation is confronting , for better or worse , its premier natural_resource . Decide which of those observations you ' d make first , and perhaps you ' ve decided whether the Yangtze is for you . By the time we ' d cleared the last of the gorges , Qutang , the cruise had covered more_than 600 miles and we had entered Sichuan province . In Wanxian , a city of 300 # 000 , about half of whom are to be relocated as part of the dam project , we ate a local dinner and browsed through an evening marketplace . In Fengdu , fabled as a &quot; ghost city &quot; and disquietingly self-conscious of itself as a tourist stop , some visitors boarded a tramway , viewed torture instruments in aged temples and peered down from a scenic bridge between peaks . Others sampled the city ' s free market , a free-for-all of geese , chickens , eels , produce , bright colors , pungent odors , grinning butchers and haggling farmers . Eventually we came_to Chongqing , our final port , and it emphatically finished the job of delivering us from landscape to cityscape . Greater Chongqing straddles the river and houses about 15 million people amid traffic , grit and closely built , cloud-covered hills . We debarked in late evening , five days and 840-odd miles after we ' d begun , and were immediately absorbed by local traffic and delivered to a lavish , five-year-old Holiday Inn for our last night . Nearby , a massive concrete bridge , opened_to much fanfare in 1980 , spans the river . My last look_at the Yangtze , through the window of an airport-bound van , was from atop that bridge . The river moved slowly , obscured by mist , clogged by idle boats , conquered by the city . But that ' s not the way I intend to remember it .
