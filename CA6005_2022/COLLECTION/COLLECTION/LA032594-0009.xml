   <TEXT> * Mayor Richard Riordan ' s plan to convert Olympic and Pico to one-way &quot; super-boulevards &quot; ( March 11 ) is excellent and will significantly reduce east-west traffic bottlenecks in the Los Angeles Basin . The various environmentalists and &quot; NIMBYs &quot; arrayed against the plan are well-intentioned , but miss the mark.Their continued resistance to improved traffic flow throughout the city will not so_much encourage Southern Californians to use public transportation as induce them to move to Phoenix , Denver , Portland and Seattle . Unfortunately those who leave will take their businesses ( and critical jobs ) with them . Environmentalists and traffic planners are right to push for conservation and a cleaner environment . But their tools should be car-pool lanes and more stringent emission standards rather than opposition to the mayor ' s quite sensible suggestions for better traffic flow . TAD SMITH Los Angeles * The creation of one-way , seven-lane &quot; super-boulevards &quot; in Los Angeles to create &quot; more efficient ways to transport people &quot; seems to be a good idea . How about some &quot; bicycle boulevards &quot; too -- multi-mile residential streets ( not commercial thoroughfares ) dedicated to bicycles , and possibly also mopeds . Let ' s take a lead from our bicycle-aficionado Mayor Riordan , who said in that story , &quot; we need to be more innovative. &quot; GREGORY WRIGHT Sherman Oaks</TEXT>
