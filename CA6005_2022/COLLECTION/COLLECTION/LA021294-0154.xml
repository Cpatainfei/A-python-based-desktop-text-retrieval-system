   <HEADLINE> FILMFORUM TACKLES THE ' BEAST ' ; MOVIES : THE ORGANIZATION IS IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS PIECE OF PROGRAMMING IT ' S EVER ATTEMPTED . THE CITYWIDE FESTIVAL INCLUDES ABOUT 150 EXPERIMENTAL FILMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The thing you have to remember about experimental film is that its roots are in the static visual arts rather than the movies . A rigorously conceptual practice that concerns itself with such things as the mechanics of perception , the believability of images and the dismantling of cinematic cliches , experimental films care not a whit about linear narrative , heroes and villains and box-office prowess . They are , in short , diametrically opposed to all_the Hollywood industry holds_dear . So , don ' t show_up at &quot; Scratching the Belly of the Beast : Cutting Edge Media in Los Angeles , 1922-94 , &quot; with a bag of popcorn prepared to click_off your mind -- this history of experimental film in Southern California requires some effort by the viewer . Given that , it ' s not surprising that the 19-year-old Filmforum , the L.A. showcase for experimental film that organized the event , is for many filmgoers a well-kept secret . Founded in 1975 by Terry Cannon , Filmforum relocated in 1984 from its first home_in Pasadena to the downtown Wallenboyd Center , where it operated until 1987 , when it began presenting films at LACE . Filmforum has been without a permanent home since 1992 , and for the past year and a half most of its programming has been presented at Hollywood Moguls , a cafe on Hudson Street in Hollywood with a 99-seat theater . This May , Filmforum reunites with LACE when both will resurface in new digs at the Newberry Building on Hollywood Boulevard . The fact that Filmforum has thrived as an idea rather than an actual place for almost two years , makes_it doubly impressive that it is currently in the midst of the most ambitious piece of programming it ' s ever attempted . A seven-week , citywide festival presented in conjunction with the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities , the Los Angeles Public_Library ' s Central Library , the Los Angeles Municipal Gallery , MOCA , the UCLA Film and Television Archive , and Beyond Baroque , &quot; Scratching the Belly of the Beast &quot; will include a series of roundtable discussions and several special events . The soul of the festival , however , is the 150 films that will be screened . Organized by Filmforum ' s director Jon Stout , the festival kicked_off last Thursday with the premiere of the fourth film by Gregg Araki . From there , the series spins_out into an elaborately structured affair that includes programs conceived by nine guest curators , four evenings celebrating local organizations that have kept experimental film alive here for the past 70 years , shows devoted to groundbreaking explorations in animation , and seminal video works done_by visual artists such_as William Wegman , Paul McCarthy and Chris Burden . In surveying this series , the question arises as_to whether there ' s anything distinctly regional about experimental film in L.A. Taking a cursory glance at this far-flung array of films , the answer would be no ; each filmmaker included has developed a singular style unique unto itself . When one digs deeper , however , recurring motifs begin to appear . At the top of that list is the fact that experimental film in L.A. is obsessed with mainstream movies to a far greater degree than the experimental film of New York or the Bay Area . This concern is particularly apparent in Monday ' s program , curated by film scholar David James . Titled &quot; The Distinction of Idioms : Non-Industrial Film in Los Angeles , &quot; the program includes Robert Florey and Slavko Vorkapich ' s German Expressionist influenced 1928 essay on the perils of Tinseltown , &quot; Life and Death of 9413 -- A Hollywood Extra , &quot; along with important works by seminal L.A. filmmakers Chick Strand and Morgan Fisher that deconstruct the cinematic experience . Also included is Maya Deren ' s &quot; Meshes of the Afternoon &quot; ( 1943 ) , a groundbreaking work that filters Hollywood cliches , specifically those of film noir and women ' s movies of the ' 40s , through a feminist lens . A second recurring regional tick surfaces in Wednesday ' s program , &quot; Independent Animation in the Los Angeles Area , &quot; curated by Maureen Furniss . Paralleling a venerated tradition in local visual art , animated films hereabouts indicate an enduring love for eye candy . Is this to suggest we ' re just a dumb blond city ? Not exactly , but the look of things has always counted for a lot in L.A. The local penchant for richly optical art can be traced from Stanton McDonald-Wright ' s Synchromist paintings of the ' 20s and ' 30s , to the Lyrical Abstraction of artists like Sam Francis , to the Finish Fetish school that blossomed in L.A. in the ' 60s , up_on through the Light and Space art of the ' 70s . Similarly , there ' s a tradition here of filmmakers who ' ve made unabashedly lush &quot; paintings &quot; on film . More often than not , these cinematic paintings are scored to music , and included in Wednesday ' s programs are several visual symphonies by celebrated animator Oskar Fishinger , as well as works by brothers John and James Whitney , who pioneered the use of computers in films synthesizing abstract design and music . &quot; Why do they always have to play with mice ? &quot; James Whitney once asked_in reflecting on the limits of animated films , and the point of the work in this program is to transcend that cliche . The program on Feb . 21 , &quot; Looking Over an Underground &quot; is one of the most fascinating bills in the series , including such treasures as artist Wallace Berman ' s &quot; Untitled 1957-65. &quot; Since his death in 1977 , Berman ' s influence on the art of L.A. has become increasingly apparent , and opportunities to see this , the only film he made , are rare . A short collage of Pop imagery , Berman ' s modest film is a remarkably beautiful evocation of the audaciously sexual youth culture of the ' 60s . Also on the program , curated by filmmaker Thom Andersen , is &quot; Marcello , I ' m So Bored , &quot; a hilarious short that director John Milius made in 1966 with John Strawbridge . Other programs of note include &quot; Radiating Visions : A Tribute to the Creative Film Society , &quot; curated by Angie Pike and slated for March 5 . A film distribution service founded in 1957 , CFS handled everything from William Hale ' s &quot; The Towers , &quot; a short documentary on L.A. folk artist Simon Rodia , to Art Clokey ' s &quot; Gumbasia , &quot; an exercise in stop-action animation that served as the prototype for his subsequent series &quot; Gumby. &quot; Curator Claire Aguilar ' s program of March 28 , &quot; Personal Visions : Mapping Territories in Southern California , &quot; is highlighted by an excerpt from &quot; The Works , &quot; a collaborative film by L.A. historians Reyner Banham and Mike Davis , and &quot; Bump City , &quot; a short made by Pat O ' Neill in 1964 . O ' Neill is acknowledged as one of the most influential experimental filmmakers to emerge from L.A. , and his 1988 film &quot; Water and Power &quot; is considered his masterpiece . The series wraps_up on March 31 with a screening of that film , which is a highly abstracted examination of the relationship between nature and the industrial civilization of Southern California . Screening with &quot; Water and Power &quot; is Charles Burnett ' s exquisitely realized 1977 debut feature , &quot; Killer of Sheep. &quot; Best known for the critically acclaimed &quot; To Sleep With Anger , &quot; Burnett paints a haunting portrait of the life of an alienated slaughterhouse worker living_in South-Central ; this beautifully scored film is a defining work_on late 20th-Century life in L.A. The festival will throw a party for itself March 30 when it presents &quot; Salome &quot; and &quot; The Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome , &quot; two films by legendary bad boy of the underground Kenneth Anger ( Anger ' s &quot; Puce Moment &quot; and &quot; Kustom Kar Kommandos &quot; are included in other programs ) . The director will be in_attendance , as will &quot; Inauguration &quot; stars Cameron and Samson DeBrier . A disciple of Aleistair Crowley , Anger hammered_out a Dionysian approach to filmmaking best described as a demented hybrid of Cecil B . DeMille and Pasolini . Bringing homosexual themes to the screen with candor and wit long before that was considered acceptable , Anger ' s films combine elements of high camp and mythology to explore various American outlaw subcultures . Today , Anger ' s films may strike some as just this side of silly , but they were nothing short of revolutionary in their day . It ' s often been the case that innovations hammered_out by experimental filmmakers have been appropriated by the mainstream film_industry and transformed into popular cliches . So before you dismiss one of these films , check the date when it was made ; that may make_it clear why it ' s regarded_as an important piece of history . * Guest-curated programs will be presented at Hollywood Moguls on Monday nights . A series of feature_films made by local experimental filmmakers will screen Tuesdays at the Los Angeles Public_Library ' s Central Library . The Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities will present a series of roundtable discussions Wednesday evenings at Hollywood Moguls . Roundtable discussions and screenings at the Central Library are free ; admission to other events varies . Information : ( 213 ) 663-9568 .</TEXT>
