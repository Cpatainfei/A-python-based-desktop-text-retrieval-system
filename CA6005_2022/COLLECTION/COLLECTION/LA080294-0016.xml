   <TEXT> Two principal misperceptions dominate the current bare-knuckle political debate over immigration . One is that immigrants take jobs and reduce the wages of natives . The other is that immigrants are a drain on the public coffers , using more in_services than they pay in taxes . Both suggest that immigrants -- legal or illegal -- are changing our nation for the worse . And both are inaccurate . Since such impacts are measurable , what explains the prevalence of these misconceptions ? Part of the explanation lies_in the sheer complexity of the issue . While the overall economic impacts of immigration are positive , they can vary by level of government , the strength of individual labor_markets and the types of immigrant on which we focus . But this complex reality has been lost in a debate that all too often demands a simple good or bad bottom_line . Labor-market effects . When viewed in terms of the nation as_a_whole , the studies that use the best data and methods find that immigration has little to no overall effect on the labor-market opportunities of natives . But when the lens is focused_on individual labor_markets in times of growth and decline , a different , richer picture emerges . In times of growth , immigration actually increases natives ' economic opportunities in_labor markets where immigrants are concentrated , because their spending and investing has a ripple effect . ( In 1989 immigrants earned and recycled through the economy $ 285 billion. ) In times of economic decline or stagnation , immigration reduces the opportunities of low-skilled workers . Moreover , the one group that is consistently hard-hit by immigration is other recent immigrants . Distinctions between regional labor_markets and periods of the economic cycle are important because job production in the U.S. economy collapsed between 1989 and 1992 . So it is not surprising that worries about competition surged and remain with us still , despite the recent upturn in new jobs . Public-sector impact . This , too , depends_on the lens through which the issue is viewed . When all immigrants who arrived since 1970 are examined , it appears that immigrants generate a net public-sector surplus of $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion annually . But when a distinction is made among immigrants by legal_status , most of this surplus is found to come from legal immigrants . Illegal immigrants , who are poorer and less educated , generate a netpublic-sector deficit of roughly $ 2 billion . These findings are sharply at_odds with other recent studies that find that immigrants create a huge annual deficit . What accounts_for the differing results between those studies and ours ? The analyses that purport to find such high costs are flawed in several important ways : They underestimate immigrant incomes and , as a result , the taxes that immigrants pay ; they omit or understate major types of taxes such_as Social_Security and unemployment insurance ; they systematically inflate costs , for example , by overstating the rate at which immigrant children attend schools ; they inflate the size of the undocumented population , exceeding the government ' s own estimates by 50 % ; they ignore the job-creation effects of immigrants ; they overstate the extent to which native workers are displaced , and they inflate the welfare costs associated with displacement , assuming , for example , that displaced natives never return to work . But if immigrants generate a $ 25- to $ 30-billion net annual surplus , as our research indicates , why is the debate over immigration so furious in some sectors ? In the first place , federal spending on programs that are targeted to immigrants or to the communities in which they settle has been dramatically reduced as immigration levels have risen . Federal refugee spending fell from $ 7 # 000 per refugee in the mid-1980s to $ 2 # 000 in the early 1990s . While federal spending on bilingual education fell by 50 % through the 1980s , there was an 80 % growth in the population of schoolchildren with limited English proficiency . More important , while immigrants generate a net fiscal surplus , the bulk of the taxes they pay are federal , while the obligations for providing them services remains with local and state_governments . Hence , in some communities , immigrants generate a net deficit at the local level . The scale of recent immigration , its concentration in several states and in urban_areas and its pace ( half of the current immigrant population was not in the United States 10 years ago ) raise serious questions about the fairness of federal fiscal_policy . But before a new federal reimbursement policy for state and local_governments is proposed , it is necessary to find a principled approach to the redistribution of federal tax dollars . Such an approach requires an understanding of the differences between the costs imposed by immigrants and by natives . It also requires taking_into_account the fact that different immigrant groups -- legal , refugee , illegal -- have very different fiscal impacts . What is the federal_government ' s responsibility in terms of policy ? For instance , should the federal_government be held fully accountable for the public costs that flow_from the behavior of employers who profit by hiring the undocumented with impunity ? Sorting_out these complex issues with factual information rather than misperceptions is a key first_step toward lowering the decibel level in the angry debate over immigration .
