   <HEADLINE> DENNY ' S RESTAURANTS SETTLE BIAS SUITS FOR $ 54 MILLION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S._government officials and civil_rights advocates , hailing a &quot; new partnership &quot; dedicated to weeding_out racism in commercial establishments , announced a record $ 54.4-million discrimination settlement with the Denny ' s restaurant_chain Tuesday . The settlement , which earmarks $ 28 million for victims of discrimination at California Denny ' s restaurants , closes the book on two class-action lawsuits that became a modern version of the lunch-counter protests of the civil_rights movement ' s early days . &quot; With the help and cooperation of private counsel , the Justice_Department and Denny ' s have entered into the largest , most-sweeping nationwide settlement of a public accommodations case in history , &quot; said Deval L . Patrick , assistant attorney_general for civil_rights . The firm was accused in the lawsuits of fostering a discriminatory corporate culture and refusing to serve blacks at some of its 1 # 400 Denny ' s restaurants across the country . Denny ' s would not say how many cases of alleged discrimination in Southern California would be affected by the settlement . &quot; There are 3 # 000 claims in California and 4 # 300 in the nation , and we ' re not_able to break them out , &quot; spokeswoman Karen Randall said . But Jerry Steering , a lawyer who represents five clients who alleged discrimination at Denny ' s restaurants in Costa Mesa , Orange and Yorba Linda in 1992 and 1993 , described the agreement as &quot; good news for my clients because it represents another option for them. &quot; Steering said his clients have the option of continuing to pursue their lawsuit in U.S. District Court in San Diego -- or accept $ 35 # 000 each from the settlement fund . &quot; I don ' t know what they ' ll decide to do , &quot; Steering said . &quot; I will say that the quality of our cases is such_that they can probably get a lot more money if we go_to trial. &quot; The five customers alleged that Denny ' s either refused to serve them or demanded that they pay_for meals in_advance , even though white customers were not being asked to do so . San Diego resident Leon Youngblood alleged that a Denny ' s restaurant on 17th Street in Costa Mesa made him wait for a table while white customers were quickly seated . Youngblood called the Costa Mesa Police_Department to lodge a complaint . The Justice_Department settlement , which must be approved in U.S. district courts in San Jose and Baltimore , ends a painful chapter for Flagstar Cos . of Spartanburg , S.C. , which owns the chain . Some black customers , for example , said that they were asked to prepay for meals or to pay cover_charges before they were seated . One former restaurant manager said he was told by superiors to close his restaurant if &quot; too many &quot; black customers approached . Under terms of the arrangement , Flagstar did not admit wrongdoing . Nevertheless , Justice_Department officials said , the settlement represents a landmark in civil_rights enforcement : the largest agreement ever negotiated in a case involving discrimination at restaurants , hotels or other public accommodations . The agreement resolves separate lawsuits filed last year in California and Maryland . The California plaintiffs include Rachel Thompson of Vallejo , a 15-year-old black girl who went_to Denny ' s in late 1992 to celebrate her 13th birthday but was refused the restaurant ' s customary free birthday meal . The Maryland lawsuit was filed by six U.S. Secret_Service officers who stopped at a Denny ' s in Annapolis in May , 1993 , amid preparations for a speech by President Clinton at the U.S. Naval Academy . The black agents said that they sat for nearly an hour without being served , even as they watched white colleagues served several times . Their lawsuit was expanded to include claimants in 48 other states . Under the settlement , Flagstar will pay $ 28 million in damages to California customers , plus $ 6.8 million in attorney fees . The chain will pay $ 17.7 million to customers in Maryland and other states , along with $ 1.9 million in legal_fees . Customers who feel they were treated unfairly at Denny ' s can request claim_forms and apply for a portion of the damages by calling the company toll-free at ( 800 ) 836-0055 . The claims will be screened by an independent claims administrator and the Washington Lawyer ' s Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs , which filed the Maryland lawsuit . Damages will be prorated among victims whose claims are approved . Besides paying damages , Flagstar will be required to retain an independent civil_rights monitor to ensure the company ' s compliance with the settlement . In addition , it agreed to feature blacks as customers and employees in advertisements , train its employees in racial sensitivity and allow representatives of a civil_rights group to make random spot checks for bias at Denny ' s outlets . Flagstar officials said that the company already has begun satisfying many of the agreement ' s requirements . Attorneys for plaintiffs in the class-action suits said that the settlement could become a precedent for future discrimination cases . Patrick , noting that the Justice_Department is pursuing 20 other cases involving alleged discrimination at public accommodations , issued a pointed warning to any companies that still practice racial discrimination : &quot; We are watching. &quot; The settlement &quot; symbolizes what I think is a return of the finest moments of the civil_rights struggles , in which the Department_of_Justice locked arms with civil_rights lawyers and the private bar to win relief for victims of discrimination , &quot; said John P . Relman , an attorney for the Washington Lawyer ' s Committee . &quot; We hope and believe that this is the beginning of a new partnership . . . . We want the Justice_Department by our side. &quot; Flagstar still faces a handful of individual discrimination lawsuits . A spokesman said that the company hopes to settle those cases separately . Appearing at a separate news_conference Tuesday , Flagstar Chief_Executive_Officer Jerome J . Richardson insisted that the chain , which has $ 3.8 billion in annual sales , never had a policy of discriminating against blacks . But , he conceded , &quot; clearly , these plaintiffs did not feel that way , and I regret that. &quot; Richardson , who owns the National Football_League ' s new Carolina Panthers franchise , said he was concerned last summer that the allegations of racial bias would hamper his bid for a team . But he said he was even more worried about damage to his personal reputation and that of the company . Times staff writer Greg Johnson in Orange County contributed to this story .</TEXT>
