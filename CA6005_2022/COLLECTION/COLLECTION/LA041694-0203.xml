   <HEADLINE> RELIGION / JOHN DART ; MANY VALLEY CATHOLICS WELCOME VATICAN DECISION ON ALTAR GIRLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The presence of women reading Scripture and occasionally distributing Communion at Roman_Catholic Masses may have muted any displeasure by the tradition-minded over the Vatican decision this week to permit altar girls . &quot; If you allow women to give_out Communion , then altar girls are nothing , &quot; noted Father Robert McNamara , pastor of St . John Eudes in Chatsworth . The announcement was welcomed by Bishop Armando X . Ochoa , who oversees the 48-parish San Fernando Pastoral Region in the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese . &quot; When you have a mother who happens to be a lector ( who reads Scripture ) at the Mass or a eucharistic minister ( who distributes Communion to parishioners or shut-ins ) and you do not allow her daughter to be an altar server , it was a very difficult pastoral situation , &quot; the bishop said . In recent years , many U.S. parishes , including an estimated 20 of 48 parishes in the San Fernando , Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys , permitted altar girls , usually aged 8 to 14 , to assist the priest while he is celebrating Mass , lighting candles and presenting him with bread and wine to be consecrated . The practice had grown since 1983 , when a revision in church laws did not explicitly forbid girls to join boys as altar servers . American bishops , governing parishes which jumped at the chance , asked the Vatican to clarify the issue about a year ago . At that time , new parish requests for altar girls were put_on hold . &quot; As I went_around visiting parishes , invariably the question came_up from girls , ' Why can ' t we be altar servers ? ' &quot; Ochoa said . The Los Angeles archdiocese will issue guidelines to the parishes next week , said spokesman Father Gregory Coiro . The muted traditionalist Catholic objections to altar girls stem partly from concerns that advocates of priesthood for women would win another small victory . Conservative Catholics have worried that Vatican-approved altar girls &quot; would create a comfort level with women exercising some kind of liturgical role , &quot; said Gabriel Meyer , associate editor of the Encino-based National Catholic Register . &quot; I ' m disappointed but not surprised by the Vatican decision , &quot; said Jack Kocienski of Camarillo , president of the conservative California Coalition of Concerned Catholics . &quot; It may give some women the false hope that they could become priests. &quot; But as Kocienski and church officials noted , the papal-approved announcement Wednesday described the change as an interpretation of existing church law and has no effect on the doctrinal prohibition against women priests . Another traditionalist objection comes from church history . Altar servers now perform duties in a Mass that were once done_by an acolyte , an ordained position that was considered a boy ' s first_step toward priesthood . But the modern altar server -- boy or girl -- is not ordained . Yet the symbolism remains for some older_Catholics . &quot; I think it ' s a misuse of girls to have them assist at Mass because this has been the traditional means of young_men to enter seminary , but we are living_in a feminist culture and women want to do everything that men do , &quot; said Charles Belting of Northridge . He described himself as an obedient Catholic even as he expressed misgivings in an interview . &quot; I follow whatever the Holy_Father approves , &quot; said Belting . The Vatican ' s Congregation for Divine Worship and Sacraments , in outlining the change , said that altar servers represent &quot; a noble tradition &quot; that has led to priests and must continue to be supported . But editor Tod Tamberg of the archdiocese ' s weekly newspaper said more was at stake than inspiring future priests . The altar role not only fosters thoughts of priesthood in boys but also imparts to children a reverence for the sacred that most ex-altar boys would affirm lasts for a lifetime , he said in an editorial this week . &quot; Teaching our children -- boys and girls -- to reverence the Sacred in our church and in our lives is something all_of us can agree fits the definition of a pastoral need , &quot; he wrote . Msgr . Francis J . Weber , archdiocesan archivist based at the San Fernando Mission , said church traditions die_hard . &quot; Some traditions should die , some should be maintained . But traditions should always serve the time you ' re in , &quot; Weber added . * Altar girls &quot; have been vastly accepted &quot; by Burbank ' s St . Francis Xavier Catholic_Church since they were introduced three or four years ago , said Holy Cross Father William J . Neidhardt , the senior pastor . &quot; I ' m very happy ( Vatican approval ) finally came through. &quot; Father Edward J . Kaminski , an associate pastor at St . Francis , added that there is a practical benefit too : &quot; The girls have been more enthusiastic than the boys and more reliable. &quot; In that vein , Granada Hills ' St . Euphrasia parish , which has not had altar girls , is looking_forward to training them . &quot; We have had an extremely difficult time getting guys to serve , &quot; said Father Raymond A . Saplis of St . Euphrasia . &quot; I think once we get the girls in , there will be competition for recognition between the boys and girls. &quot;</TEXT>
