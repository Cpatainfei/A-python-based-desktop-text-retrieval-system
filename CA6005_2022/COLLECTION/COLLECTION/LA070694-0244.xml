   <HEADLINE> RISE OF RELIGIOUS GROUPS DIVIDES CONSERVATIVE TOWN ; TOLERANCE : INFLUX MAKES COLORADO SPRINGS NATION ' S EVANGELICAL CAPITAL . SOME SEE THREAT TO CITY ' S TRADITIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At Rampart High_School , things have changed so_much that 17-year-old Jennifer Fry said it &quot; doesn ' t seem like a public_school any more. &quot; Students drive cars with religious bumper stickers and wear T-shirts emblazoned with depictions of bloody fetuses and religious slogans . One student sobbed in the hallways because a friend had not accepted Jesus_Christ . &quot; In class , it doesn ' t matter what we ' re discussing , the ' God thing ' is dragged_in a lot , &quot; said Fry , an intern at a weekly newspaper that writes critically of the growing religious influences here . &quot; If we ' re talking_about an earthquake in Malaysia , someone will say it ' s a sign of the Rapture . I call it plate tectonics. &quot; From its beginnings in the mid-1800s as a resort and mining center nestled on the eastern flank of Pikes Peak , Colorado Springs has been a bedrock of conservative values . It is home to Ft . Carson Army_Base , the Air_Force_Academy and the North_American Air_Defense Command . But some longtime residents of this town -- which prides itself on a tradition of live-and-let-live libertarianism -- say they are unnerved by a recent influx of fundamentalist Christian organizations that have made this community of 306 # 000 people the evangelical capital of the United States . Now home to 50 national Christian religious groups -- half of which arrived during the past decade -- Colorado Springs has become a place where a police_officer gave a religious pamphlet to a developmentally disabled apartment resident who was disturbing the peace and where children were invited to a carnival , only to be baptized without their parents ' knowledge . Colorado Springs is also the community that spawned the highly controversial Amendment 2 , a 1992 statewide initiative barring anti-discrimination laws aimed at protecting homosexuals . Amendment 2 was ruled unconstitutional in state district court and is now on appeal_to the state Supreme Court . Several leaders of the new religious groups say the concerns are unfounded . They came here , they say , because of bargain land and housing prices , spectacular mountain vistas and a community already known for its solid conservative views . Now they say they want to nest peacefully as good neighbors while continuing their evangelical and charity work across the country and around the world . If anyone suffers from discrimination or intolerance , they say , it is they and their children who are forced to live_in a secular society and attend &quot; Godless schools. &quot; However , many of the same people who tangled over Amendment 2 now are entrenched in bitter ideological disputes over what should be accepted as authentic knowledge in schools and practical values in the community . Such tug-of-wars are taking_place in hundreds of communities across the nation . Typically , evangelical Christians say they are trying to live_by absolutes derived from Scripture , while liberals say they are merely espousing tolerance for cultural and religious differences and subscribing_to the scientific_method . But many of the clashes here over moral , ethical and religious issues are among staunch conservatives who also consider themselves Christians . These disputes are impacting daily life in City_Hall and in neighborhoods and schools throughout the community . &quot; What ' s happening here is very unfortunate ; it ' s a strange town to live_in right now , &quot; said attorney Greg Walta , a fundamentalist Christian who has lived here since 1968 . He said some of the conservative religious newcomers &quot; stereotype &quot; people who do not believe as they do , a trend he describes as &quot; destructive to our schools and our community. &quot; In local schools , some teachers say they now choose their words carefully . One high_school instructor said she prefaces her comments from the lectern with &quot; this is only my personal opinion , &quot; to avoid antagonizing pupils who cite biblical passages to dispute her lessons . The newly arrived Christian leaders are not trying to compete with existing religious groups or stack school_boards or the City_Council , said Paul Hetrick , vice_president of Focus_on the Family , a nationally prominent group that relocated from Pomona to Colorado Springs in 1991 . &quot; We are designed to support the ministry of churches rather than compete with them , &quot; said Hetrick , whose organization is by far the largest religious group in Colorado Springs , with about 1 # 200 employees and an income of $ 94 million last year . As a ministry aimed at bolstering family values via the airwaves and publications , he added , &quot; we are not conversant in local school issues other_than looking_at newspapers when we get home from work. &quot; But some_other leaders and members of other fundamentalist groups here say they believe that there can be no middle ground . &quot; What ' s going_on in Colorado Springs is a battle over religious principles , &quot; said Kevin Tebedo , a native of Colorado Springs and spokesman for the group Colorado for Family Values , which sponsored Amendment 2 . &quot; The two sides cannot come_together , &quot; he said , because at its root , &quot; Judeo-Christianity is very intolerant. &quot; &quot; Jesus said : ' I am the way , the truth , and the life , and no man comes_to the Father but by me. ' You don ' t get there through Buddha , Allah , Mary_Baker_Eddy , Charles_Darwin or Joseph_Smith , &quot; Tebedo added . &quot; If you ' ve rejected Jesus_Christ as your savior , you ' re going to hell. &quot; Some townsfolk call that a confrontational brand of Christianity and a growing threat to the city ' s cultural diversity , schools , civil_liberties and image . The influx gathered momentum in 1989 when , in the depths of the state ' s last recession , the city ' s economic development arm began scrambling to attract new businesses and nonprofit groups to help diversify the local economy . One staffer of the Economic Development Corp . turned_to her network of personal contacts among Christian groups . That targeting strategy , which produced a bonanza , was halted this year because &quot; we clearly now have a critical mass of those ( religious ) organizations , as well as telemarketing and defense contract firms that we didn ' t have before , &quot; said Rocky Scott , president of the Economic Development Corp . While the agency will continue to help relocate religious organizations if asked , it is now emphasizing high-technology firms because the city badly needs independence from declining military spending that supports 50 % of its jobs , Scott said . The religious groups that are here , he added , deserve praise for the 3 # 000 positions and estimated $ 300 million they generate annually . But some longtime residents note that these religious organizations are tax-exempt and that the jobs they have brought will not make_up for further defense cutbacks that may target Ft . Carson , which accounts_for 20 % of local jobs . Still others point to acrimony on the city ' s Human Relations Commission as evidence of an unintended consequence of the influx -- heightened political tensions in a city already polarized by passage of Amendment 2 . On June 13 , the 15-member commission , which has been in existence for nearly three decades , was suspended for six months by the City_Council , in part because the panel had reached a bitter impasse over proposals to meet with community groups that advocate civil_rights for homosexuals . City officials are currently reviewing the commission ' s purpose . Until now , that mission seemed clear-cut : work toward the elimination of prejudice , intolerance and intergroup tensions , and promote goodwill , community awareness , mutual_understanding and respect . Not anymore , according to Human Relations Commissioner Vincent D ' Acchioli , who moved from Los Angeles to Colorado Springs in 1991 to help Every Home for Christ set_up shop . D ' Acchioli objected bitterly to any commissioner appearing to sanction gay groups by talking to them . D ' Acchioli , who compares the local gay rights group Ground Zero to the Ku Klux Klan , says he vehemently believes that homosexuals and those who celebrate diversity are undermining traditional American values grounded in Judeo-Christian tradition . &quot; The ' celebrate diversity ' crowd is a tragedy to me -- it ' s like celebrating our differences , &quot; D ' Acchioli said . &quot; My idea is to get_away from that garbage. &quot; &quot; Colorado Springs is a battleground for heated issues such_as abortion and homosexuality , &quot; D ' Acchioli added . &quot; When one side or the other will not settle for total surrender -- and that ' s what you have here -- there can be no compromise. &quot; Angry over such strident views , and the sway conservative religious groups seemed to have over community affairs , a diverse group of residents banded_together three years ago to form the Citizens Project . The group , which includes conservative Christians and liberals , publishes a monthly newsletter called Freedom Watch , which monitors the activities of conservative religious groups and individuals . For example , the incident last summer involving the police_officer who handed_out a religious pamphlet alarmed Citizens Project members and others who saw it as an unwarranted intrusion of church in police matters . After the incident , police officials said it was against department policy for the officer to have given a religious pamphlet to the man , who had been talking loudly on a downtown apartment telephone after 10 p.m. Police officials said &quot; appropriate action &quot; was taken , but they declined to say whether the officer , one of about 30 members of Police_Officers for Christ here , was disciplined . In an effort to promote alternative viewpoints , Citizens Project also hosts &quot; dialogue dinners &quot; -- informal gatherings of residents who discuss a range of personal views on issues ranging from abortion to school curriculum . &quot; We believe the problem ( in Colorado Springs ) is a small but incredibly vocal minority bolstered by the critical mass of conservative religious organizations , &quot; said Mike Shaver , co-director of Citizens Project and an avowed Christian . &quot; The dialogue dinners aim to build consensus , to look_for areas where a majority of people can agree. &quot; A separate effort to find common_ground between the opposing factions involves local clergy in a 2-year-old , broad-based &quot; community concerns group &quot; representing every shade of opinion -- from conservative evangelical to liberal . Leaders of that group include Rabbi Harold Hirsch of Temple Shalom and James C . Dobson , president of Focus_on the Family , which has hosted unity meetings of its own . &quot; Our goal , &quot; Hirsch said , &quot; is to move toward mutual_understanding rather than mutual recrimination. &quot; School officials want the same thing in_troubled District 20 , where the hottest topics of the moment are sex education , the origin of the human_race and contentious Christian students in school . The influx of religious groups has been dramatic in the district , a booming sector of northern Colorado Springs enveloping Rampart High_School and the Christian Missionary Alliance , Every Home for Christ and Focus_on the Family . There , parents were alarmed to learn earlier this month that four biology teachers at Rampart High_School skipped two textbook chapters on evolution . Some parents blamed the problem on pressure from fundamentalist Christians . High_school officials denied that , saying the chapters were omitted because of their length and because they were redundant . That dispute has been resolved , said Donna Nicholson , the district ' s new associate superintendent . &quot; Evolution will be taught here , &quot; said Nicholson , who arrived four months ago from Longview , Tex. , where she had to iron_out similar disputes . Nicholson said the real problem is a lack of written policies about how to address curriculum content . She has asked a school district lawyer to review policies with an eye toward correcting inconsistencies in the curriculum and clarifying the role of religion in school . Rori Whelan , 43 , who claims that her two daughters have been &quot; victims of harassment by Christian bullies at school , &quot; says she plans to move to another side of town if the situation does not improve soon . &quot; On the playground , my 9-year-old daughter told some kids that she did not believe_in Adam and Eve , &quot; Whelan said . &quot; They made_fun of her , told her that she was stupid and didn ' t believe_in God. &quot; She said her other daughter attended a sex education class at a middle_school here two years ago in which a religious video was shown without permission of school district officials . &quot; This is a public_school , for goodness sake , &quot; Whelan said . &quot; I don ' t believe it is a place for people to inflict their beliefs on others . And certainly my kids should not be made to feel_like second-class citizens because they don ' t preach Jesus in the hallway. &quot; The Rev . Ted Haggard , senior pastor of the 4 # 800-member New Life Church , blames the uproar in District 20 and across town on &quot; liberals &quot; who are suddenly having to deal with issues that make them uncomfortable , but must be reckoned with nonetheless . &quot; I ' ve seen Christians all_over this nation , and man , these Christians ( in Colorado Springs ) are not hostile , angry people , &quot; said Haggard , who established his 10-year-old church after the &quot; Holy_Spirit spoke_to me and said he had chosen this city for a special purpose. &quot; &quot; When a society switches to relativism , those who believe_in absolutes stick_out like a sore thumb , &quot; he said . &quot; Colorado Springs is a gasp of hope that what was good in the Bible is still good. &quot; But Pastor George Otto of the Broadmoor Community Church , part of the United Church of Christ , worries that some religious groups are trying to &quot; produce a construct of folk who are relatively alike. &quot; &quot; These people are not going_to be in the saddle forever , &quot; Otto said . &quot; Ultimately , they will either moderate their positions , or this is just a phase_in the life of American religion. &quot;</TEXT>
