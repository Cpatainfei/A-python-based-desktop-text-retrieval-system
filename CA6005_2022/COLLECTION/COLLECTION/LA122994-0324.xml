   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; PROFIT TAKING CLIPS ASCENT OF BLUE_CHIPS ; DOW FALLS 22.2</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Blue-chip stocks snapped a four-day advance Wednesday , hurt by year-end profit taking , a drop_in the dollar and some signs of stability in the Mexican market slowing the migration into American holdings . The stock price movements were exaggerated by thin holiday-week trading . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.20 to 3 # 839.49 after being run_up 94 points in the previous four sessions . The blue-chip index had gained more_than 175 points since it closed at 3 # 677.99 on Nov . 22 . The decline in the dollar was felt most in the bond market , where prices fell sharply in a sell-off that spilled into stocks . Given that situation , there were &quot; good reasons to take profits , &quot; said Bob Walberg , market_analyst at MMS International in Chicago . Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones nearly 3 to 2 on the New York Stock_Exchange , but volume was light . About 243 million shares changed hands on the Big Board , up from 211 million shares traded Tuesday . The dollar fell nearly 3 pfennigs to about 1.55 German marks on technical factors , and declined against the Japanese yen and other major currencies . The drop_in the dollar pushed the price of the 30-year bond down 27 / 32 point , or $ 8.44 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . The bond ' s yield , which moves_in the opposite direction , rose to 7.83 % from 7.76 % late Tuesday . Shorter term Treasury securities posted smaller losses , and most bills , the shortest term maturities , actually gained strength . Market_strategists said the drop_in long-term bond prices was sparked by fears that the dollar ' s decline would accelerate inflation . Rising prices tend to diminish the value of bonds and other securities that pay interest at fixed rates . The dollar also fell against the Mexican_peso after a strong run-up over the last week . Investors grew concerned that Mexico ' s financial crisis would begin to have an adverse effect on the dollar and U.S. securities . There were unconfirmed reports that Mexico would try to increase a $ 6-billion credit_line with the United States and use the borrowed money to buy pesos . Such a strategy would aim to bolster the beleaguered Mexican_peso , which went_into free fall last week after the Mexican government abandoned its policy of supporting it . Todd Clark , senior director in equity trading at Mabon Securities , said that with the partial recovery in the peso , investors weren ' t necessarily following last week ' s strategy of selling Mexican securities and buying U.S. issues . &quot; The theme for the last couple of weeks that has really propped_up the U.S. market is the repatriation of capital from Latin_America , &quot; he said . &quot; Now that we ' re seeing a little stability in Mexico , the impact of that has lessened a little bit. &quot; Among the trading highlights : * The Mexican stock_market recovered some ground , so that American shares of Mexican companies ended higher . Mexico ' s IPC index , the key measure of the Bolsa , ended the day 2.67 % higher . Telefonos de Mexico ' s American depositary receipts rose 3 3 / 4 to 41 1 / 2 on leading volume of 11.45 million shares on the New York Stock_Exchange . Grupo Televisa rose 2 5 / 8 to 32 1 / 2 . The Mexico Fund rose 2 1 / 4 to 22 1 / 4 . * Among the 30 Dow index components , International Paper fell 1 1 / 2 to 74 5 / 8 , IBM fell 1 1 / 4 to 73 and Caterpillar slid 1 to 54 1 / 4 . * Gold stocks bucked the market trend and rose , along with a $ 2.10-per-ounce rise in spot gold prices to $ 383.70. Santa Fe Pacific Gold rose 1 / 2 to 13 1 / 4 ; American Barrick added 7 / 8 to 22 5 / 8 ; Placer Dome advanced 1 1 / 8 to 22 . * Retail stocks extended Tuesday ' s slide following reports of lackluster Christmas sales . Toys R Us fell 3 to 30 1 / 8 after a delayed opening for an order imbalance , following reports that Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co . had lowered earnings estimates . A call to Wertheim Schroder was not returned . * AnnTaylor declined 2 1 / 4 to 31 7 / 8 . Montgomery Securities said AnnTaylor might not meet its fourth-quarter profit goals and a C.J. Lawrence analyst lowered earnings estimates for it and several other retailers . Elsewhere , foreign markets were mixed . London stocks finished a quiet post-Christmas session mostly higher . The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 closed 12.4 points higher at 3 # 095.8. In Frankfurt , German share prices pared most of their minor gains by the close of the bourse session as DAX futures prices slipped into losses , dealers said . The DAX index ended_up 2.86 points at 2 # 109.01. Tokyo stocks ended lower , with the Nikkei average off 45.83 points at 19 # 665.53. February deliveries of light , sweet crude_oil finished 15 cents a barrel higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange , at $ 17.79 .</TEXT>
