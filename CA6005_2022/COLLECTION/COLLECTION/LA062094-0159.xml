   <HEADLINE> KING ' S RANSOM ; COLLECTORS PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR ELVIS ARTIFACTS AT MAJOR LAS VEGAS AUCTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The King is dead , long live His Stuff ! A computer chip manufacturer paid $ 320 # 500 this weekend for Elvis Presley ' s stretch Mercedes-Benz limousine -- after having deposited $ 1 million with the auction_house in case the bidding went that high . Others paid $ 68 # 500 for Elvis ' royal_blue , silver-studded performance jumpsuit . And $ 2 # 070 for Elvis ' navy_blue denim swim trunks ( size 38 waist ) , and $ 1 # 035 for a stained , diagonally striped , white-gray-and-black tie that the King had worn and slopped on , and $ 34 # 500 for Elvis ' personal , Giannini acoustic_guitar . His pajama bottoms went_for $ 2 # 250 , his comb for $ 950 and his gold necklace , with trademark TCB ( Taking_Care of Business ) logo and lightning bolt , for $ 55 # 000 . But for just $ 425 , Pat and Michele Vodrey of Garden Grove successfully bid on exactly what they came for , and could afford : three Elvis 45s on the Sun label , including a prized , blue vinyl copy of &quot; Hound_Dog &quot; with &quot; I Want You , I Need You , I Love You &quot; on the flip side . &quot; We love Elvis ! &quot; Michele gushed as she paid the cashier . &quot; We ' re going to get_rid_of the family portrait and hang these right over the couch. &quot; And so it went Saturday and Sunday at the Las Vegas Hilton , an old Elvis haunt where the largest assemblage ever of the rock ' n ' roll icon ' s personal articles and career artifacts went_on the auction_block , teasing small fans and major collectors alike from throughout the world . Robert Hammond was dispatched from Boston by his wife , who was unable to travel . But as the editor of an Elvis Presley fan club newsletter , she wanted to get_in on the action . &quot; See everything ( in the auction catalogue ) marked with an X ? Those are all_the things she wants , &quot; Hammond said . &quot; My wife , she ' s an extreme fool. &quot; Despite concerns that he couldn ' t afford anything , by Sunday night Hammond had two items to take_home : a gold medal identification card once carried by an Elvis aide ( $ 600 ) , and a tiny piece of gold bedroom carpeting ( $ 300 ) . Though he was confident that his wife would view them as prizes , Hammond made clear where he stood . &quot; At that price , I think it comes_out to $ 15 # 000 per square_yard , &quot; he said . &quot; I feel_like a jackass. &quot; Linda Bergstrom , who came from Chicago , was the elated buyer of a gilt-metal inkstand-penholder that Elvis used as a pipe stand . Its value was estimated at $ 150 in the auction catalogue ; her winning bid was $ 1 # 400 . &quot; I ' ll keep it in my bedroom , &quot; she said . &quot; Aside from the bedroom_set , it ' ll be the most expensive thing in there . My husband ' s going_to freak , but he owes it to me. &quot; Michelle DeMoss came from Northridge , to restart an Elvis collection that was destroyed in the January earthquake . She got $ 2 # 500 from her insurance_company for the lost Elvis collectibles -- and used it to buy a 45 record autographed by Elvis ( $ 1 # 400 ) , a set of Elvis pencils and a pen ( $ 150 ) and a black ceramic ashtray ( $ 1 # 100 ) used in an upstairs office at Graceland , Elvis ' Memphis mansion . &quot; I ' ve got better stuff now than I did before the earthquake , &quot; DeMoss cooed . &quot; These are things he actually owned or autographed. &quot; Radio_station owner Dave Schnehrer flew out from Flint , Mich . to buy Elvis ' sunglasses . They cost him $ 3 # 100 . &quot; I think they were the ones Elvis was wearing in the last photograph ever taken of him , &quot; he said . &quot; I hope nobody sits on them. &quot; Author Patricia Jobe Pierce snatched_up two of Elvis ' rings for about $ 10 # 000 . The one with the tiger eye setting , she said , &quot; is his essence. &quot; After paying_for them , she immediately put them on her fingers . &quot; They fit ! &quot; she proclaimed . More_than 1 # 000 people bid on the collection , said Pamela Tapp , spokeswoman for Butterfield &amp; Butterfield , the Los Angeles auction_house that staged the event . About half of the participants attended the auction here , where Elvis performed between 1969 and 1976 before 2 1 / 2 million fans . Another 500 or so people -- many from overseas and reportedly including Ringo Starr -- bid through telephone banks operated in Los Angeles and San Francisco . The unloading of the Elvis collectibles was a bittersweet experience for Jimmy Velvet , the 1950s songwriter and singer who befriended Elvis in 1956 . Velvet opened his Elvis Presley Museum in 1978 , the year after the King died . Over the years Velvet had acquired about 800 Elvis collectibles from members of Presley ' s family and entourage . Since he has opened other celebrity-item museums , Velvet decided to keep his 200 favorite Elvis items and sell the rest . By Sunday evening , 560 items had sold , bringing Velvet $ 2 million and change in gross sales . The highest-ticket item : the 1969 Mercedes-Benz six-door Pullman limousine , which Presley rented once while on_tour , fell_in_love with and insisted on buying . His former road manager , Joe Esposito -- who attended the auction for old time ' s sake -- said Elvis paid about $ 40 # 000 for the vehicle , after promising the limo company that it could still use the Mercedes when he wasn ' t in town . But Elvis reneged_on his promise and kept the limo for himself , Esposito said . Car collector Edward Arnold , chairman and chief_executive_officer of Integrated Circuit Systems , came_to Las Vegas from Valley Forge , Pa. , intent_on buying the vehicle . And he did . No one topped his last bid of $ 290 # 000 -- on which another 15 % was added for the auction_house ' s piece of the action . &quot; It ' s a thrill , guys , I swear ! &quot; Arnold bubbled after the auction hammer was banged down . On the other side of the room , Jimmy Velvet could only wonder how much more money he could have made . &quot; I knew he had deposited a_million dollars to buy the car . He got_it for a steal . I could have had someone bid against him ( to drive the price up ) but that would n ' t have been right . I feel_like I lost $ 700 # 000. &quot; But Arnold found a way to spend his savings ; later he bought Elvis ' 1977 Cadillac Seville -- driven by Elvis the day before he died -- with a $ 90 # 000 bid . For every millionaire in the crowd , there was an Elvis impersonator -- or , more accurately , an impersonator of an Elvis impersonator . Johnny Wentzel -- wearing a macrame rope belt , white jumpsuit and bushy sideburns -- paced the auction floor , hoping to find an affordable Elvis jumpsuit . &quot; I make my own jumpsuits -- you can ' t tell the difference between mine and Elvis ' -- but I want one of his to use as a pattern , &quot; Wentzel said . &quot; There are 30 to 40 working Elvis impersonators in town , you know. &quot; And their waist sizes range from 30 inches to 40 inches , he added . While some Elvis collectors clearly came here to purchase specific items , others were caught_up in the moment . John Corbett , one of the stars of the popular television series &quot; Northern Exposure , &quot; showed_up at the auction out of curiosity and ended_up successfully bidding $ 36 # 000 for Elvis ' American Express card and $ 60 # 000 for Elvis ' birth record document . &quot; The spirit of Elvis must have jumped in me , &quot; Corbett said afterward . &quot; Until now , the only Elvis things I had was one of his Christmas albums and his ' Aloha from Hawaii ' -- via satellite -- tape . But I love Elvis. &quot; Corbett said he would n ' t leave home without Elvis ' American Express card .</TEXT>
