All in all , however , the Belgian press concluded that the conditions provided_for their team have been excellent . &quot; By all evidence , our best footballers . . . are residing in a superb hotel complex nestled into a bit of countryside in a place that is a quasi-paradise , &quot; according to Le Soir .</TEXT>
