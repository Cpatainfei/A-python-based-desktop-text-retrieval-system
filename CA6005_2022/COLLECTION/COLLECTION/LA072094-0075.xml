   <TEXT> Long-term bond yields fell_for a second consecutive session Tuesday , as market optimism intensified ahead of Federal_Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ' s congressional testimony . At the same time , the dollar rose despite news that the U.S. trade_deficit widened in May . Stocks fell_in lethargic trading . In the credit markets , the Treasury ' s key 30-year bond fell to 7.46 % from 7.50 % , while its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , rose 13 / 32 point , or $ 4.06 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Greenspan was to appear before a Senate panel today and Friday with updates on Fed economic and monetary policy , and bond traders planned to monitor his words closely for hints of interest_rate moves . Recent reports suggesting that the economy slowed in the first_half of this year have convinced many bond traders that the Fed will not raise short-term interest_rates before late August . That sentiment recently has given a boost to prices of fixed-income securities . Bond market players previously feared the Fed would raise rates soon . Higher rates on new securities erode the value of already-sold bonds and other securities that pay a fixed rate of return . &quot; The tone of the market has turned constructive . The market is now assuming that the next tightening , at the earliest , would come probably in August or early September , &quot; said Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp . in Minneapolis Short-term Treasury securities rose 1 / 8 point to 5 / 32 point and intermediate maturities rose 7 / 32 point to 13 / 32 point , the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported . Meanwhile , in the currency market , rumors of unrest in North_Korea provided a reason for technically motivated traders to exchange Japanese yen for dollars , currency dealers said . &quot; Rumors started the ball rolling , but people were already looking_to buy dollars for technical reasons , &quot; said Zlatko Glamuzina , chief dealer for the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia . Currency dealers described the dollar ' s performance as a temporary lull in a lengthy decline . Reports circulating in the markets that tensions in North_Korea had escalated triggered heavy sales of yen , causing the dollar to rise in_relation_to its Japanese counterpart . Although the Commerce_Department reported a widening of America ' s overall trade_deficit in May -- to $ 9.17 billion from $ 8.5 billion in April -- the U.S. deficit with Japan narrowed nearly 20 % , to $ 4.4 billion . Analysts were doubtful , however , that the deficit figure represented a turning point in America ' s long-standing trade imbalance with Japan . Still , currency dealers cheered the trade report , pushing_up the dollar in New York to 99.25 Japanese yen from 98.35 yen late Monday . The dollar also gained against the German mark . It ended at 1.568 marks , up from 1.547 marks late Monday . On Wall_Street , stocks retreated amid a flood of quarterly corporate earnings_reports . Banking and technology shares were hurt by concerns about profit reports from those industries . The blue-chip Dow Jones average fell 7.12 to 3 # 748.31 on the New York Stock_Exchange , where volume was 251.54 million shares , up from 226.46 million shares traded Monday . In the broader market , retreating issues outnumbered advancing ones 9 to 8 on the NYSE . Stocks traded_in a narrow range throughout the day as investors reacted to earnings_reports from some of the largest companies . GTE Corp , General Electric , Sprint and Amgen were among those posting better-than-expected earnings , and their stock prices rose accordingly . &quot; Earnings are coming_in just about right , and there have been some nice positive surprises , &quot; said Bill Allyn , managing director at Jefferies &amp; Co . Still , there was enough concern about earnings in certain sectors that investors ignored the drop_in interest_rates . Investors often bid stock prices higher when rates fall because that means corporations have to pay less for money . Although many companies showed good earnings , some reports contained nasty surprises that pushed_down share prices . Intel , for example , announced numbers late Monday that were in_line with expectations but said profit_margins shrank . Its stock fell 1 5 / 8 to 57 in Nasdaq trading . And at Citicorp , although earnings were strong , trading profits were significantly lower than in last year ' s second quarter . Most banks reporting have shown lower trading revenues . The Intel and Citicorp profit reports weighed_on the whole industry , and it didn ' t help that other companies , such_as Signet Banking , Merrill Lynch and Lotus Development , also posted sour results . Still , trading was lethargic . Analysts said many investors resisted dipping_into stocks before Greenspan ' s testimony Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee . Among the market highlights : * Chase Manhattan slipped 2 3 / 8 to 36 3 / 8 ; Citicorp dropped 1 1 / 4 to 40 3 / 4 ; Signet Banking Corp . fell 4 3 / 8 to 36 1 / 2 . * Biotechnology company Amgen Inc. rose 2 1 / 8 to 48 7 / 8 after its strong earnings prompted several Wall_Street brokerages to upgrade their ratings on the stock . * Lotus Development shrank 5 5 / 8 to 33 1 / 8 . The software company said product delays and pricing pressure hurt its second-quarter results . * Compaq , which is scheduled to announce earnings today , fell 1 1 / 4 to 33 1 / 4 in heavy trading . * Merrill Lynch retreated 7 / 8 to 36 1 / 4 after reporting second-quarter earnings of $ 1.18 a share , compared to $ 1.52 in the equivalent three months of last year . That was below market expectations of $ 1.36 a share for the period . * PepsiCo was unchanged at 30 1 / 2 . The company said second-quarter profit rose 5 % , a sub-par performance that reflected lagging profits from the company ' s restaurants and beverage business abroad . Stocks rose abroad . Frankfurt share prices rose sharply in the last few minutes of trading , as players covered short positions . The market mood was buoyed by hope for a Bundesbank rate cut on Thursday . The 30-share DAX average closed 30.60 points higher at 2 # 128.79. Tokyo ' s 225-share Nikkei average ended 57.52 points higher , at 20 # 775.16 ; London ' s Financial Times 100-share average rose 9.3 points to 3 # 091.3. The Mexico_City , the Bolsa index finished 18.96 points lower at 2 # 255.30. The Nasdaq index , which is heavily weighted with technology shares , was hit hardest among the market ' s best-known barometers . It fell 3.30 to 719.32. Among other major market indicators , the Standard &amp; Poor ' s index of 500 stocks fell 1.36 to 453.86 , while the NYSE ' s composite index lost 0.55 to 250.89. At the American_Stock_Exchange , the market_value index gained 1.31 to 433.90. Market Roundup , D8</TEXT>
