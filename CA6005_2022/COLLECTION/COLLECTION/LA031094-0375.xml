   <HEADLINE> PARKER ' S PLACE : PUTTING A VALUE ON LIVES -- OURS AND THEIRS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last week , a false spring issued across the county at a time when , traditionally , rain is pouring . For us humans , this meant summer clothing , sun on our skin and the usual increased activity out of doors . The beaches and bike trails were hopping , the tennis_courts busy . Interested looks and smiles passed between people of similar age and opposite gender , hormones simmering in the warmth . Premature as it was , this little faux came as a welcome reminder that winter -- mild as it has been thus far -- will soon be coming_to a close . My domestic_animals sensed the change , too . The big dogs took_to lumbering after rabbits , barking with recharged enthusiasm at the UPS man , a patient fellow named Michael who does his best to ignore their bluff . Eddie , the indoor dog , developed a new talent that my brother identified as &quot; method begging , &quot; in which the dog recalls the traumas of his puppyhood in_order to bring more pathos to his begging expression . Everybody had a new angle . The wild animals of our region also enjoyed the weather . At night , the coyotes of Laguna Canyon sang with a volume and energy unheard in recent months . Mockingbirds , sparrows and bushtits cavorted loudly , even though it will be several weeks before they get_down to the actual business of mating and making nests . Mosquitoes hatched out -- big ones droning through the twilight sky . The fence_lizards came_out in_force , both the adults with years of life behind them and last fall ' s hatchlings , which are now almost doubled in size . Lizards are the only animals I know that can find sun faster than a tourist . They napped on fence_rails , shot across asphalt to nab the newly active ants , dangled , darted and delighted in the woodpile . In the mandevilla vine by my porch , a small web about the size of a playing card supported several hundred tiny hatchling spiders I could barely see , let alone identify . At first , I thought they were seeds . When I blew on the web , the seeds grew almost invisible legs to scurry up and down the silk to safety , though only moving about an inch . Then their legs folded back and they looked_like seeds again . Within a day , the black ants had found the web and were gingerly negotiating its glossy byways , carrying_away meals by the mandibleful . Confronted by this resurgence of the living , the observer couldn ' t help but feel an uplifting of spirit . For the better part of the first day , I went_about my business capaciously reassured that life is good , life is sacred , life is holy . I wanted to gather all these things into my arms , carry them inside , seat them around my table and put_on the feed bag for them . I wanted to listen to the smallest problems of the field_mouse , to counsel , if I could , the two hummingbirds who had been dueling ferociously over access rights to the lavender blossoms . I wanted everybody to love everybody else . Noonish , my brother Matt lifted a sheet of plywood from the woodpile , to uncover a 40-inch red rattlesnake curled_up beneath it . After locking the dogs safely away , we flipped_over the wood and beheld the serpent . She ( only a guess ) was coiled up in almost perfect symmetry , roughly the diameter of a dinner_plate . She didn ' t move . Her eyes were open , because snakes don ' t have eyelids to close . Matt and I gazed down at the thing and wondered what to do with it . &quot; Nine rattles , &quot; I noted . &quot; Pretty capable looking , &quot; said Matt . &quot; We could make a belt_out of it , but it seems like a waste of life. &quot; &quot; They don ' t taste very good either . Sort of like a really old catfish. &quot; &quot; All those ribs. &quot; &quot; Probably been here all winter . Just made_it up_to the top for the sun . It ' s too sluggish to even rattle. &quot; &quot; I worry more about the dogs than about us . They ' re dumb enough to walk right into this thing. &quot; We used a snake hook to raise and lower the reptile into an empty trash_can . She barely uncoiled during the airlift . She hit the plastic bottom with a thud , then offered a desultory rattle of about two seconds . Her rattles sounded waterlogged . &quot; Well , &quot; said Matt , &quot; first we had a rattlesnake in the woodpile . Now we ' ve got a rattlesnake in a trash can. &quot; &quot; we ' ll have to think_about this one. &quot; There ' s nothing like the discovery of something dangerous in your village -- a rattler , a rogue lion or leopard , a cobra , a scorpion -- to make one think a little harder about life and what it is worth , and what it is not worth . It was clear to me that killing the snake for self-defense wasn ' t an altogether truthful concept because rattlesnake bites are , for humans , at least , rarely fatal . However , leaving it in the woodpile to revitalize in the coming spring seemed both foolhardy and irresponsible to my dogs and visitors ( some with_children ) who come_up here almost weekly . I spent the early afternoon contemplating the ethics of humankind as we interact with the other species on this planet , wondering if we , as a race , have been egregious in assuming without much thought -- until recent times -- that nature ' s bounty is simply there for us to utilize , displace or liquidate as we see fit . Certainly most of us agree that it is both ethical and necessary for human_beings to eat some plants and some animals in_order to sustain our lives ( animal rights activists would disagree , claiming that a living animal should not be killed and eaten , but a living plant should be ) . So , ruling_out the rattlesnake as food , what is my ethical obligation to her , as a genuine threat to the health and welfare of myself and the people , dogs , cats , horses , etc. , around me ? Even under minimal scrutiny , the &quot; life is sacred &quot; argument doesn ' t cut much ice in our day-to-day world . Few of us balk at swatting a mosquito taking a blood_meal from our flesh , or mourn the termites we exterminate . Only a fool would protest eradicating cancerous cells or the AIDS virus -- both of which are very much alive . We have accorded some lives a lower standing than others , cancelable on demand . Thus , we find ourselves in the position of judging -- almost strictly on the basis of self-interest -- what life should be taken_for protection or for food , what life qualifies to be left alone , preserved , even worshiped . It is difficult to put a value on life , but we , as humans , if we think_about it , are asked to do_it every day . Happily , there was a workable compromise with_regard_to the rattlesnake , in a way there might not be with a man-eating tiger or a rogue grizzly_bear . We simply dumped the sleepy reptile into a six-pack cooler , took her to the other side of the mountain and let her go_on a hillside where , we hope , she will bother no human and no human will bother her . Of course , the snake will eat her meals of mammals and lizards and defend herself against predators , with none of the foregoing introspection . She has a cleaner sight line than we do . Watching her slide beneath the prickly_pear , I was thankful that there is room in this county -- at least for now -- for both of us to eke_out a living .</TEXT>
