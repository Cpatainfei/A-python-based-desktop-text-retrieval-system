   <HEADLINE> DMZ NOT ALL THAT PEACEFUL FOR S . KOREA VILLAGE ; ASIA : NORTH_KOREAN JEEPS AND OTHER MILITARY GEAR ARE AN UNNERVING PRESENCE FOR FARM FAMILIES LIVING ALONG THE HEAVILY ARMED BORDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ku Chun Woo ' s eyes harden as the North_Korean Army patrol jeep , bristling with radio gear , rattles_off into the late afternoon sun . &quot; This is my hometown , &quot; said Ku , standing near his flooded rice field 100 yards inside South_Korea . &quot; My ancestors lived here . I was born here . I have no interest in leaving. &quot; The jeep and other military gear are an unwelcome and unnerving presence for Ku and about 240 other South_Korean farmers and their families who dwell here , within hectoring distance of the most heavily armed border in the world . Ku will soon head toward his house , where his wife and two daughters , ages 6 and 4 , are waiting to begin dinner . Any last-minute family errands in the village will have to be finished quickly . All residents are required to be in their homes by sundown . At 11 p.m. they will bolt their doors and windows to keep_out intruders from North_Korea who might try to sneak across the border and kidnap them -- and later claim they defected . It ' s another day inside the post-Korean War curiosity that Americans call Freedom Village . In many ways , Taesong-dong is a typical Korean hamlet . It has a school , shops , a pharmacy , rows of neat brick-and-frame homes and some picket_fences . But even more_than their countrymen elsewhere on the Korean_Peninsula , residents of Taesong-dong live , literally , under the shadows of guns . South_Korean soldiers stand_guard as they work in their fields . &quot; Sometimes North_Korean soldiers come_to the line and try to talk to the villagers , try to get them to defect , &quot; said one of the military guards , Cpl . Ahn Byung-hoon , through a translator . &quot; It gets especially spooky at night or in fog or rain . You ' re not sure what ' s out there. &quot; Taesong-dong is a metaphor , in part calculatedly so , of life in South_Korea . The 1953 armistice that ended the shooting in the Korean_War resulted in the existence of three villages inside the demilitarized zone ( DMZ ) , the 2.5-mile-wide buffer that cuts a 150-mile swath across the peninsula and divides North and South roughly at the 38th Parallel . One of the three is Panmunjom , a village destroyed by tank fire during the war . It was designated as the site of the truce talks , which continue sporadically to this day . The village straddles the military demarcation_line that runs_down the middle of the DMZ , marking the border . In addition , both nations reserved the right to set_up one &quot; working &quot; village inside their sector of the DMZ . They chose sites directly opposite each other . The village on the north_side , a_few yards from Taesong-dong , is called Kijong-dong , or Peace Village . Southerners call it Propaganda Village : Every day , Taesong-dong residents are subjected_to long propaganda harangues boomed over the border through three-story loudspeakers , urging them to cross voluntarily into the workers ' paradise of North_Korea . No one has yet accepted the invitation . Sometimes the competition for the hearts and minds of Koreans on opposite sides of the line sinks to seemingly childish proportions , though probably not inconsistently in an area where for years negotiators have sat across a green baize table and hurled insults at each other . A few years ago , South_Korean authorities built a 330-foot tower in Taesong-dong from which to fly their national_flag . A few weeks later , the North_Koreans put_up a 525-foot tower in Kijong-dong . The flag that flies from it is 98 feet long . It requires a 25-knot breeze to unfurl and a large truck to haul it off for cleaning . As the South_Koreans like to point_out , Taesong-dong is inhabited around the clock by working farmers . Kijong-dong , in contrast , appears to be vacant most of the time . Not all_the games played inside the DMZ are peaceful . The current mayor of Taesong-dong carries a nasty bayonet scar on his chest from an attempted kidnaping about 15 years ago . When he resisted , he said , North_Korean troops stabbed him and left him for dead . Like virtually all Koreans , farmer Ku longs for eventual reunification of his country -- a vision common on both sides of the border . Before his death in July , North_Korean leader Kim Il Sung had targeted 1995 for reunification -- albeit under his own terms . How Kim ' s successor will deal with this commitment remains unclear . In the South , ardor for quick reunification has cooled , as the realization has settled in that reunification would be costly . South_Koreans have closely scrutinized the reunification of East_Germany and West Germany -- the resulting economic drain on the prosperous West . Most are now convinced that a similar effort in Korea would be even harder on their pocketbooks , because the disparity between the two regions is greater than in Germany . The South ' s economy is more_than 10 times bigger than the North ' s , where even basics such_as food are in short supply , defectors say . Per-capita income in the South is more_than five times higher than in the North . Most southerners now speak_of reunification in five to 10 years . Public_opinion_polls indicate that most South_Koreans doubt that North_Korea would launch an attack . Even in Seoul , the booming metropolis of 10.5 million just 35 miles south of the DMZ , within range of North_Korean artillery , residents find it hard to believe those guns would ever be used . &quot; We are all brothers , &quot; said E . B . Lee , a Seoul businessman who was born in the North but whose family fled south at the end of World_War_II . &quot; And , besides , they could never win. &quot; Closer to the demarcation_line , where residents have witnessed North_Korean attempts to infiltrate the South by various means , including rubber boats and tunnels , people aren ' t so sure . &quot; I ' ve seen their willingness to violate the terms of the truce , &quot; said Ku Chun Woo , watching an egret swoop in from the north and splash down in his rice field . &quot; Especially if they had nuclear_weapons , I think North_Korea would attack. &quot;</TEXT>
