   <HEADLINE> CIA SPY SUSPECT , WIFE REPORTEDLY TO PLEAD GUILTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Closing one of the biggest spy cases in American history , CIA official Aldrich H . Ames and his wife have agreed to plead guilty to espionage and federal tax_evasion in a settlement that would put Ames in prison for life but would recommend no more_than a five-year sentence for Rosario Ames , sources said Tuesday . Paving the way for their guilty pleas Thursday before U.S. District Judge Claude M . Hilton , a federal grand_jury in nearby Alexandria , Va. , will return a sealed indictment against the couple containing the two felony charges . Under a provision crucial to the government , Ames , 52 , has pledged &quot; full cooperation &quot; with federal investigators who have been attempting -- so far unsuccessfully -- to learn precisely which secrets he sold to the Soviet_Union and later to Russia during an eight-year spying career , the sources said . He also has agreed to describe any assistance he received from colleagues at the CIA who acted either knowingly or unwittingly . The government is prepared to recommend a term of life imprisonment without parole for Ames , the same maximum sentence he could have expected if convicted after a trial . Investigators have found no evidence that Rosario Ames , 41 , directly participated in passing secrets to U.S. adversaries , although they say she helped her husband make bank_deposits of large sums of cash and helped exchange messages with his Russian handlers . She has acknowledged difficulty coping_with her incarceration since the two were arrested Feb . 21 and expressed concern about the welfare of their 5-year-old son , Paul , who is being cared_for by a relative . Referring to Ames , a 31-year veteran of the agency , one source said : &quot; He ' s falling on his sword for the sake of his wife and son. &quot; Evidence introduced by the government during pretrial court hearings suggests , however , that the case against Ames is overwhelming . The FBI , which had him under surveillance for nine months before his arrest , said it intercepted telephone_calls between Ames and Russian agents . It also reported finding more_than 100 classified CIA cables on computer discs at his home , including many outside his area of authority . Officials said a nine-page letter later found in Ames ' study spelled_out the priorities set by his Soviet handlers several years ago . They said the handlers were especially interested in information about CIA penetrations of the Soviet KGB and its military intelligence service , the GRU . During much of the period in_question -- 1985 to 1991 -- Ames was chief of Soviet counterintelligence in the CIA ' s Soviet-East European Division . In addition , in a statement made shortly after her arrest , Rosario Ames acknowledged to FBI_agents that her husband had received millions of dollars from the Russians for his spy work . After conferring_with an attorney , she declined to say more . Justice_Department officials and chief defense_attorney Plato Cacheris refused Tuesday to respond to questions about the plea agreement . But officials had said previously that the government would benefit enormously from Ames ' cooperation -- something they would not obtain if he insisted on going_to trial . Without Ames ' help , CIA analysts have been unable to assess fully the espionage damage to CIA operations . They also have not determined how many sources of information used by the agency were compromised . Work_on the assessments was curtailed out of concern that any paperwork created before trial might be obtained by defense_attorneys and used in framing a defense , sources said . The tax_evasion charge to which the pair will plead guilty flows_from government allegations that Ames received at least $ 2.5 million in cash from the Russians -- none of which was ever reported to the IRS . The amount is more_than twice the amount Moscow has been known to give to any other American spy . Ames ' CIA superiors became suspicious after he paid $ 540 # 000 in cash for a new home_in suburban Virginia and bought a luxury automobile with a $ 25 # 000 down_payment . But he passed a polygraph test in 1991 after telling his superiors that his wife inherited money from her late father in Colombia . As part of the plea agreement , the government is expected to require the Ameses to give_up hundreds of thousands of dollars that they still hold_in foreign bank_accounts , along with penalties and interest for failing to declare it as income . In a related development , directors of the CIA , the FBI and the Justice_Department have agreed in &quot; broad principle &quot; to a plan that would alert the FBI sooner to counterintelligence problems inside the spy agency , officials said Tuesday . The plan , drawn_up by the National Security_Council staff in the White_House , is likely to be outlined in Administration testimony next month before the Senate and House Intelligence committees . White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Tuesday that the plan is being developed at &quot; the President ' s request in the wake of the Aldrich Ames arrest. &quot; Although the FBI was helping the CIA hunt for a mole inside the intelligence agency in 1991 , the bureau did not learn that Ames ' polygraph results were suspicious until two years later , said Sen . Dennis DeConcini ( D-Ariz. ) , chairman of the Intelligence Committee . A Justice_Department official said the changes probably would be accomplished by a combination of a presidential order and legislation giving investigators expanded access to financial information about people working in intelligence agencies . Under the plan , the FBI would be designated as the primary agency for overseeing counterintelligence investigations in all U.S. spying organizations , and a senior FBI official would head a new counterintelligence center .</TEXT>
