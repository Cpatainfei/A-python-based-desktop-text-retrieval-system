   <HEADLINE> BIG GAME IS FANS ' DREAM , SECURITY NIGHTMARE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 500 fans filled the Quonset hut-shaped gym at Dorsey High_School , forcing school officials to close the doors 40 minutes before the start of a Friday afternoon basketball_game between Dorsey and Crenshaw . &quot; No more room , &quot; a school policeman informed 300 other fans outside . Even Marques Johnson , former NBA star and father of Crenshaw forward Kris Johnson , had to talk his way past security . And he played basketball at Dorsey for a year before transferring to Crenshaw . Later that evening in East Los Angeles , about twice as_many fans turned_out to see Cathedral play_at Salesian in a game that matched two teams that had a combined record of five wins and 30 losses . The doors had to be closed an hour before the 7:30 tip-off . Why ? It ' s the Big Game . Rivalries can be a time when a team with the worst of records can be motivated to play its best . They unite communities , attract crowds and rekindle friendships between former competitors . But they can be a scheduling and security nightmare . Last year Cathedral and Salesian played an important Santa Fe League football game to empty stands at Piux X High in Downey . The game was moved to a neutral site and played_on a Thursday because of administrators ' concerns about possible violence . * &quot; The situation was getting hot , really hot , &quot; said Jerry Scott , Salesian football_coach . &quot; Guns were involved ( in incidents leading_up to the game ) . that ' s why the administration stepped_in before anyone got hurt . If one student got hurt , it would have been a death_warrant for that school. &quot; Cathedral , located between Elysian Park and Chinatown , and Salesian , which is in Boyle Heights , have been rivals since the mid- ' 80s , when the two Roman_Catholic all-boys schools became members of the Santa Fe League . Both attracted students from the same elementary_schools . The rivalry became so intense last year that school officials banned fans from sporting contests between the two schools for two years . &quot; The whole reason for playing a closed football game was to play a safe game with no incidents , so no players or students would get hurt , &quot; Scott said . &quot; The problem is with the young alumni , guys who graduated two or three years ago who don ' t want to let_go_of those high_school years. &quot; Officials from both schools kept last year ' s game site secret from news media , students and fans . Only coaches , players and officials attended the game , which Cathedral won , 13-3 . The ban was to last until next January , but media and community pressure forced the schools to admit fans to the games , Scott said . Salesian , which has separate bleachers for opposing fans , played host to both basketball_games this season . Increased security and a bigger faculty presence kept the games incident-free . &quot; Some of the rivalries are very healthy and have gone_on for so_long that parents and their children often attend the same high_school , and the tradition is carried_on from one generation to another , &quot; said Barbara Fiege , City athletic commissioner . &quot; The forefront is the Garfield-Roosevelt ( football game ) . It ' s a family-oriented game where people are not afraid to bring their little kids. &quot; * That matchup has become the area ' s biggest football game and a model for other rivalries . In the 58th meeting between the two last year , the game , now called the East Los Angeles Classic , drew an overflow crowd of 25 # 000 to East Los Angeles College ' s Weingart Stadium . Officials hope to move the Classic to the Rose Bowl next season to accommodate a bigger crowd . What makes games between rivals exciting yet dangerous ? &quot; Kids competing against each other from the same neighborhood , &quot; said Robert Garrett , Crenshaw football_coach . &quot; They played Little_League together , they went_to the same junior_high . That is what makes a game a rivalry. &quot; Crenshaw-Dorsey games are among the City ' s most exciting and competitive , whether football , basketball or track . &quot; I don ' t ever have to emphasize the importance of the Crenshaw game , &quot; said Paul Knox , Dorsey football_coach . &quot; They see these players daily and they know who will be talking and boasting if they are victorious. &quot; &quot; We only have problems with outsiders and the non-participants , &quot; Garrett said . &quot; The kids never have been a problem on the field. &quot; Gunfire erupted during the closing minutes of a 1991 football game between the two schools ; two students were wounded by bullets that ricocheted across the field . Two years earlier , a game was interrupted by gunfire outside Jackie Robinson Stadium ; no injuries were reported . The Los Angeles Unified School District has $ 55 # 000 set_aside in its current athletic budget to pay_for additional security at such &quot; critical games , &quot; Fiege said . The fund covers all sports , but mainly is used for football and basketball_games . &quot; This year has been a very quiet year for the City in comparison to a_few others , &quot; she said . &quot; I think it ' s a credit to the individual schools and their administrators . There is more communication between schools , and administrators are taking_care of things before they happen. &quot; The best rivalries require teams of equal ability -- but that is not always the case . Said Randy Rodriguez , Lincoln football_coach : &quot; When one school actually loses a lot and the other team is having a winning season , it can get ugly . . . . &quot; The Tigers have had the upper_hand lately against cross-town rival Wilson in football , but are still trying to avenge the clobberings they endured in the ' 70s . The worst took_place in 1977 , when Wilson held a 63-0 halftime lead . The Tiger team , reduced to 20 players because of injuries , boarded a bus and left before the start of the second_half . &quot; We still get haunted by that , &quot; said Rodriguez , who was a Lincoln assistant in 1977 . &quot; We had a bunch of great kids on the team . I have that team picture in my office as a reminder . If we ever get beat that bad again , it ' s time to get out. &quot; And other rivalries are downright personal , like the Bell Gardens-Montebello basketball_games . The Lancers ' Charlie LaCommare has coached against younger brother Dennis 10 times in the last five years . Said Charlie : &quot; I ' ve never lost to him yet. &quot;</TEXT>
