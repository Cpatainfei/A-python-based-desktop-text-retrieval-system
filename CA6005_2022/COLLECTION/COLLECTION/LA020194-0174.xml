   <HEADLINE> HIGH_COURT DENIES PAYOUT OF LIFE_INSURANCE IN OVERDOSE ; LAW : STATE JURISTS SAY FAMILY CANNOT COLLECT ON A PORTION OF COVERAGE BECAUSE MAN COULD HAVE EXPECTED PROBLEMS FROM COCAINE USE . RULING DRAWS FINE LINE FOR DEATHS BY ' ACCIDENTAL MEANS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The California Supreme Court held Monday that the Orange County survivors of a man who voluntarily ingested cocaine and died of an overdose cannot collect life_insurance benefits intended to cover deaths by &quot; accidental means. &quot; In a 5-2 decision , the court said that the death was not caused by &quot; accidental means &quot; because the deceased could have reasonably anticipated that death or great bodily injury would occur from ingesting a hazardous , illegal drug . The ruling leaves California in the minority of states that distinguish insurance coverage for accidental death from that for death caused by &quot; accidental means. &quot; Under the latter definition , a fatality that results from an intentional action that could lead to death -- such_as participating in a particularly dangerous sport -- would not be covered , according to one of the attorneys in the case . &quot; Courts around the country have abolished the distinction because it is a distinction without meaning , &quot; said Santa Ana attorney Richard A . Cohn . &quot; To uphold the distinction simply allows the Supreme Court to choose when and where it wants to draw_the_line . . . . &quot; The case was brought by the Santa Ana mother and sister of Michael P . Weil , who died at 32 of a cocaine overdose . Weil , an engineer in the semiconductor industry , was in San Francisco on business in 1985 and was staying_at one of the city ' s most elegant hotels when he ingested enough cocaine to kill himself . Federal Kemper Life_Assurance Company paid his mother and sister , Lola Brown Weil and Michelle Weil of Santa Ana , $ 100 # 000 as beneficiaries of the life_insurance policy but refused to allow them to collect another $ 100 # 000 under an accidental death rider in the policy . A trial_court and a Court of Appeal ruled against the insurance_company , which appealed the case to the state ' s high_court . &quot; . . . It is clear , &quot; said Justice Ronald George , writing for the majority , &quot; that California cases in a variety of factual settings have interpreted policies affording coverage for death effected through accidental means to preclude coverage for voluntary and intentional conduct that results in unintended death. &quot; Justices Stanley Mosk and Joyce Kennard , the most moderate members of the conservative court , dissented in a 106-page opinion that was twice as long as the majority decision . They argued that the survivors are entitled to collect under the policy because the overdose was accidental . &quot; In all cases in which the insured ' s act was more_than negligent but not tantamount_to suicide , &quot; Mosk wrote , &quot; the insured can reasonably expect to be covered. &quot; Mosk noted that cocaine-related deaths are only a recent phenomenon , and at the time of Weil ' s death , the drug was the recreational choice of young , upwardly mobile professionals such_as Weil . The evidence indicated Weil was only an occasional user and did not expect to be harmed by the drug , Mosk said . Only 3.6 % of all cocaine-related deaths in 1985 were caused by orally ingesting the drug , the method apparently used by Weil , the justice said . &quot; Far from believing that death would follow in all probability , &quot; Mosk wrote , &quot; the reasonable person would have believed it highly improbable that such modest recreational use would kill him. &quot; Cohn , the attorney for Weil ' s mother and sister , said the majority decision was one more in a long line of pro-insurance industry rulings by the state ' s high_court . &quot; It is just a tragedy to see the California Supreme Court narrowing the ability for victims and people who have been injured to recover for their losses , &quot; he said . &quot; At every turn , the California Supreme Court is going toward helping the insurance industry. &quot; But Daniel Maguire , the Los Angeles attorney who represented Kemper , said the ruling correctly &quot; furthers the public policy in California that we should not treat manifestly dangerous activity the same as an accident. &quot; &quot; If people engage in violent , dangerous , illegal and reckless behavior , &quot; Maguire said , &quot; there is not going_to be double indemnity under these types of policies. &quot; Neither the beneficiaries of the policy nor the insurance_company could be reached for comment . In another case decided Monday , the court held that a logging plan approved before the Northern spotted owl was declared a threatened species can still stand but will have to be amended to conform_to later rules intended to protect the animal . An attorney for an environmental group said the decision will affect a handful of logging plans in California .</TEXT>
