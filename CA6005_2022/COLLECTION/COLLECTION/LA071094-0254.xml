   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : QUARTERFINALS ; DUTCH ARE DOWN -- AND OUT OF TOUCH ; SOCCER : AS LONE NETHERLANDS PLAYER TO COMMENT , WITSCHGE LAMENTS BLOWN OFFSIDE CALL ; ADVOCAAT PREFERS TO PRAISE BOTH TEAMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They went_down fighting -- and for once , they weren ' t fighting each other . For the_Netherlands World Cup team , that was a considerable achievement . Not as great a feat as getting_to the final would have been , but exiting on a sad yet harmonious note will have to stand as Holland ' s crowning achievement in the 1994 tournament after its 3-2 quarterfinal loss to Brazil on Saturday at the Cotton Bowl . So distraught were the Dutch players afterward , only one player , left midfielder Rob Witschge , was composed enough to talk with reporters . The rest , according to Coach Dick Advocaat , were &quot; down and out. &quot; Witschge was certainly down . And he lamented that the Dutch were out of the tournament because of a missed offside call . Witschge contended that Bebeto ' s goal , scored in the 62nd minute to give Brazil a 2-0 lead , should have been nullified because another Brazilian forward , Romario , was offside . Despite the players ' vehement arguments and Advocaat ' s stony stare from the sideline , the goal stood . &quot; We are crushed , &quot; Witschge said . &quot; It ' s terrible to lose like this . It is one of the saddest moments of my soccer career. &quot; Advocaat politely and repeatedly refused to comment on the goal . &quot; It ' s on my tongue to say it was offside , but I ' m not saying that , &quot; he said . &quot; I haven ' t said anything about the refereeing in the World Cup and I would n ' t like to start now. &quot; He preferred instead to praise his opponent and his team . The Netherlands ' two goals were the most scored against Brazil in this tournament so far and it marked the first time any team had scored twice against the Brazilians in a World Cup game since the 1982 tournament in Italy . &quot; Brazil is world class , &quot; Advocaat said , &quot; and if you consider the way Holland played Brazil , I think that is a compliment to my team. &quot; Perhaps a compliment to Advocaat ' s coaching too . Advocaat , who was a steady but average midfielder in his playing days in Holland and the North_American Soccer League , had to fight to win his players ' respect . Some wanted former star Johan Cruyff to coach them , and midfielder Ruud Gullit had so little respect for Advocaat that Gullit refused to play for the team , returned , and then left again . Losing Gullit ' s playmaking was a blow , but Advocaat didn ' t concede . He tinkered with various lineups until he found a mix of energetic attacking and judicious defense , waiting patiently while striker Dennis Bergkamp found his stride and winger Peter van Vossen found his rhythm . Advocaat got his team a round deeper into the tournament than it advanced four years ago in Italy , but Brazil proved too formidable an obstacle for Advocaat to take one more step into the semifinals . &quot; I leave the World Cup with good feelings , &quot; said Advocaat , whose contract runs_through 1998 . &quot; The Dutch team played very well . . . . We can leave America with our heads high . I am very proud_of my boys. &quot; They gave him reason to be proud Saturday , as they did_in their victories over Saudi_Arabia , Morocco and Ireland and their 1-0 loss to Belgium . Although the Brazilian defense neutralized the speed of winger Marc Overmars and rarely allowed Bergkamp an uncontested inch of grass , the Dutch clawed back to erase a 2-0 Brazilian lead in the second_half and pulled even with less than 15 minutes to play . &quot; Brazil was handling the ball too_much . We didn ' t have too many chances , &quot; Advocaat said . Two minutes after Bebeto ' s goal , Bergkamp dodged Brazilian defender Marcio Santos to score the_Netherlands ' first goal and his third goal of the tournament . Their hope rekindled , the Dutch kept pressing and tied the score in the 76th minute when Aron Winter outjumped a crowd of defenders to head a corner_kick by Overmars into the net . &quot; We showed that if we have to , we can change the game ( around ) , like when we came from 2-nil to make_it 2-2 , &quot; Witschge said . &quot; We just wanted to go_on and create more possibilities to score goals. &quot; The only goal scored after that , though , was Branco ' s blast through the Dutch defensive wall . &quot; Giving_up that goal on the free_kick , that killed us , &quot; Witschge said .</TEXT>
