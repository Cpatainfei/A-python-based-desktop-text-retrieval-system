   <HEADLINE> BABY BELLS PREPARE FOR BIG CHANGES IN INDUSTRY ; COMMUNICATIONS : REGULATIONS AND INCREASING COMPETITION WILL FORCE THE STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE LOCAL MONOPOLIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A recent appeals court ruling may have spared local telephone monopolies quick extinction , but the Baby Bells that enjoy these monopolies will soon face the most extensive structural challenges since the telephone was invented more_than a century ago . On the regulatory front , federal_officials are finalizing rules that , beginning next year , will require carriers and business users to modify billions of dollars worth of phone equipment to handle new area_codes , service codes such_as 411 , long-distance company access codes and other numbers . Meanwhile , many local phone monopolies -- such_as Pacific Bell -- are under siege by rivals trying to circumvent the lucrative local phone franchise by using cable TV networks to deliver phone_calls . &quot; The telephone industry is facing more challenges now than it has in its entire history , &quot; said James Bradford Ramsey , general counsel for the National Assn . of Utility Commissioners , which represents local regulators . The Baby Bells will also have to deal with competition . Competition in local phone markets is being encouraged by a growing number of states that , in the absence of a clear federal policy , are adopting laws aimed at breaking_up the local phone monopoly . In response , the phone_companies are hunkering down and tightening their belts . The seven regional Bell operating companies , which have laid_off more_than 100 # 000 workers in the last four years , have announced plans to let an additional 60 # 000 go_by 1997 . And they are fighting hard at the state and federal levels for permission to enter the lucrative long-distance market . But holding_on to profits may become more daunting at a time when the Federal Communications Commission is proposing far-reaching and costly technical modifications of the existing phone network -- which is quickly running_out of phone_numbers and access codes . To alleviate the demand being fueled by an explosion of fax machines , cellular_phones and other high-tech communications devices , the FCC has proposed that more_than 600 new interchangeable area_codes -- with middle digits other_than &quot; 1 &quot; or &quot; &quot; -- be made available by early next year . The proposal will require modification of or replacement of private branch exchanges , or PBXs , that cannot process the new codes , as well as changes in the software that routes calls through the phone network . ( PBX equipment allows communications within a company and with the outside world. ) In addition , the access codes that some callers dial to select American Telephone &amp; Telegraph , MCI or other long-distance carriers , will be converted from five digits to six starting next year . The change will mean pay phones , hotel switchboards and other devices will have to be modified to handle the new codes . Finally , the FCC has proposed that the prefix &quot; 1 &quot; be used exclusively for calls with more_than seven digits , ending its use in some states for local inter-exchange calls . The agency also plans to increase the maximum length of an international telephone_number to 15 digits from 12 by 1997 . While the phone_companies make those adjustments , a federal appeals court in Washington introduced another wrinkle recently when it ruled that the FCC cannot force local phone_companies to give rivals space inside their own facilities to hook_up independent telephone networks . The FCC is considering appealing amid predictions that the decision will raise competitors ' costs and slow efforts to open_up the $ 100-billion local phone industry . But although shares of some local phone_company rivals took a beating on Wall_Street after the court ruling , analysts and industry officials expect the momentum toward more competitive local phone markets to continue . &quot; There ' s no question that when you move from a monopoly environment to a competitive one , there ' s going_to be some chaos and tumult , &quot; said Terrence L . Barnich , former chairman of the Illinois Public_Utility Commission , who heads his own Chicago consulting_firm , Paradigm Resources Group . The new era of local telephone competition began gathering steam last month when two telecommunications powerhouses announced plans to offer phone_service via cable_television . Time Warner Inc. , the nation ' s second-largest cable TV operator , disclosed plans in early May to use its cable TV network to offer phone_service in Rochester , N.Y. Days after that announcement , Southwestern Bell Corp . said that next year it will provide local phone_service in Montgomery County , Md. , through the Hauser Communications Inc. cable unit the company acquired last year . &quot; We believe that the introduction of telephone_service is the only revenue stream that can justify expansion of a cable ( TV ) system , &quot; said Michael Gilliam , president of SBC Media Ventures Inc. , the Southwestern Bell unit that is setting_up the new venture . He added that some analysts may think the telephone_service is a mature industry , but it still generates billions of dollars in profits a year . Still , SBC and other entrants will have to surmount daunting technological and financial hurdles . Gilliam said his company will have to install scores of switches and replace about 40 % of Hauser ' s existing coaxial wire network with high-capacity fiber-optic cable in_order to provide telephone_service .</TEXT>
