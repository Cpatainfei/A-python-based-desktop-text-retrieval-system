   <HEADLINE> REEL LIFE / FILM &amp; VIDEO FILE ; ART HOUSE TITLES HIT MARQUEE AT VENTURA THEATER ; THE MANN BUENAVENTURA HAS STARTED SHOWING SPECIALTY MOVIES , AND ALTHOUGH THE AUDIENCES AREN ' T LARGE , SO FAR RESPONSE HAS BEEN GOOD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It used to be hard to find movies with Australian drag queens or Chinese subtitles in Ventura County theaters . But for the past several months , the Mann Buenaventura has been experimenting with specialty films , commonly called &quot; art house pictures. &quot; The list includes &quot; The Adventures of Priscilla , &quot; a film about female impersonators in the Aussie outback ; &quot; Eat Drink Man Woman , &quot; a Taiwanese picture about a master chef and his three daughters , as well as &quot; Barcelona &quot; and &quot; Mi Vida Loca. &quot; Mann film buyer Denise Gurin said Ventura doesn ' t attract an art house crowd the way Pasadena or Santa Barbara does . Gurin says she has &quot; taken some criticism &quot; from her bosses for booking the non-commercial films but she gets &quot; revenge when the film does some business. &quot; Occasionally , an art film will become a commercial success , such_as &quot; The Crying Game &quot; and &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral. &quot; Generally , however , the small films don ' t pull_in large audiences , but that ' s not too important to Gurin . &quot; We ' re not making any money off of them , &quot; she said , &quot; but it affords lots of people a chance to watch films they otherwise don ' t see . I keep hearing from the manager that people are pleased. &quot; Gurin said that smaller films like &quot; Eat Drink &quot; and &quot; Priscilla &quot; appeal_to her so she tends to buy them for Mann theaters . She said she usually buys any pictures distributed by Miramax Films . Gurin said she is limited in the number of specialty films she can book because the number of prints is often low , or because her obligation to show commercial films means she might not generally have enough screens at a given time . * Screenwriter Katherine Ann Jones will answer questions at a picnic dinner following the presentation of her 1988 film &quot; The Christmas Wife &quot; this Sunday at the Ojai Playhouse . The film_stars Jason Robards as Tanner , a lonely widower who goes_to an agency to hire a woman to be his Christmas companion . After an off-putting visit to the tacky agency and its smarmy owner ( Don Francks ) , Tanner is paired up with Iris ( Julie Harris ) , a self-effacing , sad woman who makes a mystery of her background . The film was nominated for best picture and screenplay by Cable ' s Ace Awards . For Jones , an Ojai resident who is_on the faculty of the USC Cinema and Television School , the Q &amp; A will be a warm-up for a two-day seminar , Oct . 8 and 9 , on television and screen writing . The intensive workshop is from 9 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Saturday and Sunday in the Ojai Art Center , 113 S . Montgomery St . For the $ 150 fee , participants will get advice on how to choose a good_story for a film or TV_show , screenplay structure , plot and character development , constructing good dialogue and how to sell a screenplay . This Sunday ' s picnic dinner will be held at Boccali ' s restaurant , 3277 Santa Paula-Ojai Road . Dinner is $ 14 . The film screens at 4:30 p.m. at the Ojai Playhouse .
