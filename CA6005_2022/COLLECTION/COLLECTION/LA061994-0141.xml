   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; UNITED STATES HAS TO KISS ITS SWISSTER ; GROUP_A : WYNALDA ' S GOAL ON A FREE_KICK IS GOOD FOR 1-1 TIE , BUT AMERICANS AREN ' T HAPPY ABOUT FALL-BACK PERFORMANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four years ago , childhood friends Tab Ramos and John Harkes entered the Olympic Stadium in Rome and jogged out_to play Italy in the United States ' second game of the 1990 World Cup . The crowd of 73 # 659 jeered and snickered in delighted anticipation of this team of scrawny college kids being served_up to the mighty Italian team . Ramos and Harkes knocked the ball around in warm-ups , took_in the sea of Italian flags and the din of the fans , looked_at each other and laughed . &quot; What are we doing here ? &quot; they said . Four years of working to establish a presence on the international soccer scene has created a sense of belonging for the U.S. World Cup team that was expected to yield dividends on the field . The team ' s opening match against Switzerland here Saturday illustrated both the road taken and the distance yet to travel . While the 1-1 tie earned the United States its first point in the World Cup_finals since 1950 , it also exposed the growing American reluctance to move forward on a soccer field . Hoping for a victory and three points and settling for a tie and one point is the scenario confronting the U.S. team with only two more first-round games . Three points_out of three games could be enough to advance . Four more likely will be required . The urgency of their situation is clear from the team ' s widely expressed belief that , of their Group_A opponents , Switzerland was the most vulnerable . No doubt the_Swiss regarded the U.S. team similarly . In that respect , both teams were disappointed , although neither would confess to it . The Swiss were pleased that a defensive misalignment led to the goal by Georges Bregy . The U.S. team was delighted with the equalizer , a perfectly struck free_kick by Eric Wynalda . Things began so well . The crowd of 73 # 425 in the Silverdome -- site of the first indoor World Cup game -- was festive and decidedly pro-American . It might have been the first time the team has played in front of such a supportive crowd in the United States . The team came_out in its usual 4-4-2 alignment , with a_few changes : Harkes played_on the left_wing instead of central midfield and Cle Kooiman played_at right back instead of central defender . What became apparent from the start was the U.S. team ' s tendency to string_out and not offer support . The few times an American forward made any kind of penetrating run , there was no teammate there . &quot; We left a lot of gaps , we were too spread_out as a team , &quot; Harkes said . &quot; I think there is a lack of cohesion throughout the whole team . We just didn ' t play well today . We didn ' t squeeze up as a team . We didn ' t push the ball_up . We didn ' t support each other . We need to be a more compact side . There was too_much responsibility on one individual to perform a miracle. &quot; No miracles were forthcoming . Neither did the team adjust during the first_half . In many ways it was one of the U.S. team ' s oddest matches . The defense , its weak link , played exceptionally well . Its offense , where the heavy talent lies , was never in sync . The team as_a_whole was shifted too far back on the field , rendering U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic ' s build-from-the-back style problematic , and time consuming . With no_ball control in the midfield , the whole game got_out of whack . &quot; If the defense pushes_up 10 yards and the midfield pushes_up 10 yards , then we ' re closer to the front two ( players ) , &quot; Harkes said . &quot; That allows us to catch any second balls that are coming_down . If you watch today , Bregy , number six , was picking it up , and number seven ( Alain Sutter ) . We didn ' t have any pressure on them initially. &quot; Bregy ' s goal on a free_kick in the 39th minute was the result of a communication problem as the U.S. set_up its defensive wall . The players set_up six yards from the ball and the referee pushed them back to the regulation 10 yards . &quot; After that , we were way_out of line , &quot; U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola said . &quot; I just decided to hold my ground . I didn ' t want to get beat on the near post. &quot; Instead , he was beaten on the far post . But the U.S. team showed its resilience . Harkes made a slashing run and was fouled about 10 yards from the penalty area . Ramos , Harkes and Wynalda stood over the ball before the ensuing free_kick . Wynalda ' s 28-yard yard kick dipped in under the crossbar . Wynalda , who was suffering from an allergic_reaction and felt ill during the game , said it was the best shot he has ever made . &quot; It was a great goal , &quot; said Harkes , who received a yellow card in the second_half . &quot; I didn ' t think it was going_in . I started to run in , thinking it was going_to be a rebound . I thought it went_over the top , but when I saw the spiders in the corner ducked , it opened the cobwebs up. &quot; The U.S. made some changes in the second_half , but nothing was effective . Wynalda was replaced by Roy Wegerle and striker Ernie Stewart was replaced by Cobi Jones in an effort to put_in fresh legs and speed . It was the defense that preserved the tie , with the much-maligned Alexi Lalas containing Switzerland ' s dangerous forward , Stephane Chapuisat . To what end ? As World Cup host , the U.S. team bears a heavy burden and also carries the proclaimed goal of advancing past the first round . One point isn ' t bad , but it puts_on pressure for the games against Colombia and Romania . &quot; We ' re missing two points , &quot; Lalas said . &quot; We came here hoping to get three points . That was our goal . We thought it was pretty realistic. &quot; Milutinovic , who had leaped with joy from the U.S. bench at the moment of Wynalda ' s goal , walked briskly off the field at the end of the game . As is his custom , Milutinovic would neither discuss his players individually nor allow any negative connotations to linger . As he was hustled up a tunnel leading out of the Silverdome and into the blast of afternoon heat and light , Milutinovic turned and shouted , &quot; We are alive. &quot; * ERIC WYNALDA : After the embarrassment of an early red card against Czechoslovakia in the 1990 Cup_finals , he redeems himself with a beautiful goal on a free_kick . C8 * ANALYSIS : Neither the U.S. team -- with it ' s first World Cup point in 44 years -- nor Switzerland likes the result . C8</TEXT>
