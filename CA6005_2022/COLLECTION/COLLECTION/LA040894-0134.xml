   <HEADLINE> INSPECTIONS OF STEEL-FRAME OFFICES URGED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the toll of earthquake damage to steel-frame buildings mounts , the state has issued an unprecedented advisory urging owners of buildings that suffered cosmetic damage to conduct thorough inspections to check for cracks in supporting_columns . Steel-frame office_buildings have long been considered invulnerable to collapse , but the California Seismic Safety Commission issued its advisory this week because engineers have uncovered widespread evidence that steel beams and welds cracked in the Jan . 17 Northridge quake . Los Angeles city officials said that cracking has been found in the steel frames of at least 50 buildings , constituting at least 10 % of the low- to mid-rise structures built_in the area since 1970 . Most of the failures occurred in mid-rise buildings of less than 10 stories , but an 18-story twin tower in Warner Center and an unidentified 23-story high-rise elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley also had structural problems . The failures already have prompted city officials to require more rigorous welding procedures in new steel-frame buildings . On Thursday , city officials said they plan to announce within two weeks that owners of all steel-frame buildings near the quake ' s epicenter will be required to conduct inspections for hidden structural damage . Richard Holguin , assistant chief of the building bureau of the city ' s building and safety department , said officials are also considering whether to require citywide inspections of such buildings , which made_up half of all buildings constructed last year in Los Angeles . Meanwhile , the mounting damage tally has sparked concerns about the safety of the cloud-piercing towers in Downtown , Century City and elsewhere , even though engineers emphasize that no steel-frame buildings came_close to collapsing during the temblor . &quot; The world is watching , &quot; said L . Tom Tobin , executive_director of the California Seismic Commission . &quot; There is no question that this has been a wake-up call_for the engineering and construction community world wide. &quot; Steel-frame buildings , designed to bend with the enormous forces of an earthquake without breaking , have been considered among the safest to ride_out an earthquake . But the commission noted : &quot; Damage was reported to a significant number of steel structures shaken by the Northridge earthquake , raising concerns about the extent and implications of this damage. &quot; The advisory issued Wednesday said damage to some types of steel buildings has never before been observed . &quot; This is a new concern that can be serious , but should not be exaggerated , &quot; the commission said . Noting that &quot; damage can weaken a building ' s ability to resist future earthquakes , &quot; the commission urged building owners who observed damage to contact architects or engineers to investigate . City officials fear that because steel columns are covered by walls and thick fireproofing material , damage is not readily apparent to building owners or even to engineers , and that the number with cracked frames may escalate further . By late February , only a dozen buildings with steel-frame damage had been reported . So far , about 90 % of the steel-frame buildings where cracks have been reported to the city are in the Valley ; most of the others are_on the Westside . All are believed to have been built_in the last decade . Failures among these relatively new structures may have been the result of a different welding method used in recent years , said Los Angeles structural engineer Nabih Youssef , who is the head of a city blue-ribbon panel on seismic hazards . Ten percent of the joints in the Warner Center ' s 18-story twin towers cracked ; other buildings had breaks_in up_to 90 % of the welds that hold vertical columns and horizontal beams , Holguin said . &quot; Building owners should take this seriously , &quot; he added . &quot; There is a concern that buildings out there that don ' t appear to have damage do. &quot; Steel_industry officials emphasized that steel buildings are safe . &quot; These structures found a way to survive despite these problems , &quot; said Nestor Iwankiw , director_of_research at the American Institute of Steel Construction . Ray Remy , president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber_of_Commerce , said : &quot; I think any property_owner , particularly one hit hard by the earthquake , is_well advised to follow the advice of the committee. &quot; Remy said that having buildings inspected now improves chances that at least some of the costs will be defrayed by government programs . Engineers have suggested that low-quality steel , badly designed beam-to-column connections or poorly executed welds could have led to the cracks . About a dozen of the 50 buildings required temporary or partial evacuations for repairs ; the remainder are being fixed on weekends , Youssef said . Meanwhile , at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America in Pasadena , one expert estimated that some steel-frame buildings would collapse if a magnitude 7 earthquake struck directly underneath Downtown Los Angeles , which is a remote possibility . John F . Hall , associate_professor of civil_engineering at Caltech , estimated that such a quake on the deeply buried Elysian Park thrust_fault would collapse two 20-story steel-frame buildings , 30 four- to eight-story buildings and 150 smaller ones . &quot; A significant fraction &quot; of other steel-frame buildings , including some of the city ' s highest high-rises , would not collapse but would become &quot; dysfunctional , &quot; Hall estimated , some with &quot; noticeable story offsets , &quot; meaning that certain stories of the buildings would be bent out of vertical alignment , rendering them unusable . Hall and Robert Englekirk , chief_executive_officer of the structural engineering firm of Englekirk &amp; Sabol , cautioned that more study is needed before any precise upgrades can be prescribed for existing steel-frame buildings . Englekirk noted that the steel_industry is financing an unprecedented four-month study at the University of Texas to help determine what caused the cracks . Caltech seismologist Kerry Sieh said the interval between magnitude 7 quakes under Downtown Los Angeles is probably 1 # 000 to 2 # 000 years . But , he added , there are estimates that for the Los Angeles Basin as_a_whole , the interval between magnitude 7 earthquakes may be 100 to 300 years , and steel-frame high-rises are now common through much of the built-up areas within the basin . The magnitude of the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake has been put at 6.8 , only half as powerful as a 7.0. &quot; We don ' t want people to panic , &quot; Tobin said . &quot; But there is responsible action , and that is what we are pushing for . We believe strongly that ( owners of ) buildings with any reason to suspect something may be amiss seek competent advice. &quot; Times staff writer Richard Lee Colvin contributed to this article . * HUGE LOSSES : Insured damage from the Northridge earthquake is put at $ 4.5 billion , making the temblor the nation ' s second-costliest insurance disaster .
