   <HEADLINE> FIRST-EVER DEAL TO BUILD APPLE MAC ' CLONES ' ANNOUNCED ; COMPUTERS : VENTURE BY START-UP POWER COMPUTING IS BACKED BY OLIVETTI OF ITALY . MACINTOSH FANS HAIL NEWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ending a long and anxious wait for fans of the famed Apple Macintosh personal_computer , a California start-up with backing from Olivetti of Italy on Wednesday announced the first-ever agreement to build Macintosh &quot; clones. &quot; Power Computing Corp. , based southeast of San Francisco in Milpitas , said it will sell Macintosh machines under its own label and also make components and complete systems for other companies . The first clones are expected to be shipped in March , said Stephen Kahng , a well-known Silicon_Valley computer designer who is president and chief_executive of Power Computing . Kahng would not disclose prices , but the Mac clones are likely to be slightly cheaper than Macs from Apple Computer though still a bit more expensive than IBM-compatible PCs . Apple enthusiasts hailed the news , saying attractive clones at reasonable prices should help the Cupertino , Calif. , company in its effort to wrest market share from the industry ' s dominant players , Intel and Microsoft . Machines based on Intel microprocessors and running Microsoft operating systems and software have captured about 80 % of the worldwide PC market , compared to about 10 % for Apple . A March launch date would be several months sooner than expected . Don Strickland , Apple ' s vice_president of licensing , said in September that clones running the Macintosh operating system probably will not be available until the end of 1995 . Power Computing ' s aggressive launch plan bodes well for the overall Mac market , said Pieter Hartsook , editor of the Hartsook Letter , an Alameda newsletter that tracks Macintosh developments . He said his chief reservation is that 13-month-old Power Computing is an unknown with no brand identity , but he noted that that could also work to Apple ' s advantage . &quot; Kahng has a history ( in Silicon_Valley ) and no competing market , so the company can focus all_of its resources on building Mac clones , &quot; Hartsook said . Some expect Apple to eventually reach licensing deals with major industry players , possibly including Motorola and IBM , Apple ' s partners in the development of the new PowerPC microprocessor . But Apple , which resisted licensing of any sort for years , is trying to walk a thin line by allowing clones while still retaining the ability to sell its own hardware profitably . Kahng , 45 , said he was attracted to the Macintosh because of the speedy new PowerPC chip . &quot; We felt PowerPC is a new technology with very good potential , &quot; he said , adding , &quot; I am staking our existence &quot; on the Mac clones . Prototypes will be demonstrated at the MacWorld exposition starting next Wednesday in San Francisco . Kahng , who was born in Seoul , came_to the United States 25 years ago . He studied computer_science and electrical_engineering in Michigan , receiving a master ' s degree in science from the University of Michigan in computer engineering . He has since been involved in a variety of computer ventures . His former company , Up to Date Technology , designed the Leading Edge personal_computer for Daewoo Corp . of South_Korea . He was later a senior executive at Chips &amp; Technologies , which played a big role in the development of the IBM clone market . Olivetti , one the biggest computer firms in Europe , owns &quot; less than 50 % &quot; of Power Computing , Kahng said . He said he is in discussion with other potential corporate and venture_capital investors . Apple ' s Strickland said Power Computing would help speed additional clones to market by supplying components to other licensees . He added that Apple ' s and IBM ' s recently announced plan to develop a common hardware standard in 1996 that would run a variety of operating systems has sparked new interest in Mac OS licensing . Once that platform becomes available , Strickland noted , clone manufacturers would have to license only the Mac operating system software , not Apple ' s proprietary hardware . Since unveiling the Macintosh a decade ago , Apple has won a strong following among desktop publishers and others who crave ease of use and outstanding graphics . Indeed , many in the computer world have always considered the Mac vastly superior to PCs that use Intel chips and Microsoft software . But Apple charged premium prices , and the vast majority of PC users gravitated toward the less expensive , IBM-style machines . The arrival of Microsoft Windows 3.0 operating system four years ago eroded much of Apple ' s user-friendly advantage . Yet Apple still declined to license its technology to manufacturers that would have produced less expensive clones . That failure , many analysts say , has cost Apple dearly in terms of lost opportunities to build market share . Among others reportedly negotiating licensing_agreements with Apple are Toshiba and Pioneer Electronic , both of Japan , Motorola , Goldstar Technology of Korea and Radius .</TEXT>
