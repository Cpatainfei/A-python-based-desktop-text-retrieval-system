   <HEADLINE> TENNIS ROUNDUP ; SAMPRAS , BECKER IN IMPROBABLE ITALIAN FINAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pete Sampras and Boris Becker in a clay-court final ? Improbable , but true . Sampras has won only one minor clay-court event in his career . Becker has never won a title on clay . One will erase that blemish on his career today because each advanced Saturday to the championship match of the Italian Open , a clay-court event in Rome that serves as the main tuneup for the_French Open . Top-seeded Sampras extended his match winning streak to 26 by routing unseeded Slava Dosedel , 6-1 , 6-2 , in barely more_than an hour . Eighth-seeded Becker outplayed No . 4 Goran Ivanisevic , 6-2 , 7-6 ( 7-5 ) , to reach his first clay-court final in three years . The Italian Open used to be a haven for Latin_American and European clay-court specialists , but the red_clay has been speeded_up to benefit serve-and-volley and all-court players , such_as Sampras and Becker . &quot; The conditions are very quick , &quot; Sampras said . &quot; that ' s good for Boris and me. &quot; Sampras , the world ' s top-ranked player and winner of the last three Grand_Slam tournaments , has grown in confidence with each match in his first clay-court event of 1994 . &quot; He ' s the man to beat right now , &quot; Becker said . &quot; He ' s beating everybody . It doesn ' t matter whether it ' s indoors , outdoors , on hard courts or clay . I have to expect the worse and hope for the best . But there ' s definitely a way to beat him . He ' s no superman. &quot; Sampras leads Becker , 4-3 , in head-to-head meetings , but the two have never played each other on clay . Becker said he has discovered the way to win on clay . &quot; I ' ve played very good clay-court specialists this week , &quot; he said . &quot; I didn ' t have to serve 20 aces each game to win . I won with smart tennis. &quot; That meant steady , unspectacular play that showed patience and wore_down Ivanisevic . &quot; At 6-2 , 3-0 , he didn ' t have a clue what was going_on , &quot; Becker said . * Steffi Graf passed the $ 14-million mark in prize_money and reached the final of the German Open at Berlin by sweeping past third-seeded Jana Novotna , 6-2 , 6-3 . The top-ranked Graf , a seven-time German Open champion , faces Brenda Schultz , who ousted Anke Huber , 7-6 ( 8-6 ) , 6-3 , behind a powerful serve . &quot; Today I was just more concentrated and felt better , &quot; Graf said , acknowledging erratic play that had plagued her during a quarterfinal match against Julie Halard in which Graf was two points from losing . Schultz , ranked 27th in the world , reached the final of a major tournament for the first this year . * Despite playing_on a slow surface at Coral Springs , Fla. , sixth-seeded Luiz Mattar of Brazil used his serving prowess to move_into the final of America ' s Red_Clay Tennis Championships with a 6-4 , 6-4 , victory over Mark Woodforde . Only last week , Woodforde had defeated Mattar , 6-1 , 6-1 , on clay at Pinehurst , N.C. In his second final of the year , and his first on clay in a nine-year career , Mattar , 30 , will play seventh-seeded Jamie Morgan of Australia , a 6-3 , 5-7 , 7-6 ( 9-7 ) winner over Fernando Meligeni . * Maggie Simkova of USC upset third-seeded Angela Lettiere of Georgia , 6-3 , 6-4 , but Georgia defeated the Trojans , 5-2 , to reach the quarterfinals of the team competition in the NCAA women ' s tennis tournament at Athens , Ga . Florida defeated UCLA , 5-2 .</TEXT>
