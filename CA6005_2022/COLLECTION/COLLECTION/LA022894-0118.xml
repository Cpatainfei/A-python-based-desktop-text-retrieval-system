   <HEADLINE> QUAKE MAY GIVE SCHOOLS CHANCE TO UPGRADE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Before last month ' s earthquake , students at Audubon Middle_School in the Crenshaw area read 12-year-old textbooks beneath brown-stained ceilings . Classrooms at Rosemont Avenue Elementary had not been painted in decades . Lawrence Middle_School students used computers so outmoded they are no longer made . But with state and federal quake relief , these and other Los Angeles schools will be able to paint and replace aging materials . It is an unlikely benefit from the quake for the Los Angeles Unified School District , where nothing gets fixed or upgraded unless it poses a significant health or safety risk . &quot; It ' s a sort of serendipity thing , &quot; said Richard Morley , assistant principal at the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies , a magnet school in the Mid-City area . &quot; It was unfortunate the quake happened but the equipment that will be replaced will be superior. &quot; Armed with promises of an infusion of cash from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state , hopeful school officials are surveying campuses to determine the necessary repairs and the supplies that need replacing . Everything from paper and crayons to re-plumbing bathrooms and replastering auditoriums will be included on their wish lists . Federal rules require that damage be quake-related and not just the wear_and_tear from years of use . But the school district intends to argue for a liberal definition of quake damage , hoping to repair its aging infrastructure and make campuses safer for the next earthquake . School officials will contend that it is fiscally sound to paint a whole classroom , not just the single wall that has cracks , and to replace aging equipment even if it is repairable . &quot; Is it really worth the money to repair gas_lines and boilers when they are already 30 or 40 years old ? &quot; asked Margaret Scholl , director of the district ' s maintenance and operations division . &quot; If we have to paint a classroom wall , why do we have to match it with 40-year-old paint ? These are serious questions we ' re raising with FEMA. &quot; Although FEMA policy requires the agency only to repair facilities to their pre-disaster conditions , FEMA officials say they will use good fiscal sense . If it is cheaper to replace an aging pipe rather than repair it , the agency would pay . &quot; Congress didn ' t tell me to come here and be stingy , &quot; said Leland Wilson , a FEMA special assistant . &quot; I was told to come_out here and pay the money to make earthquake repairs. &quot; Decisions will be made case by case , he said . &quot; We would n ' t want them to paint a pink wall_in a classroom that has yellow walls , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; It ' s just how far do you go_in trying to make everything look nice again. &quot; FEMA officials said they are concerned whether a years-long inattention to maintenance led to more severe quake problems at schools . If inspectors find that schools were badly damaged because of a lack of routine maintenance , FEMA officials say they will issue a warning to the district that future earthquake damage will not be reimbursed . The school district , with a $ 3.9-billion annual budget , has a $ 600-million maintenance backlog on the books . During budget_cuts over the last several years , the maintenance division was slashed by a third -- leaving 500 fewer positions and ending routine maintenance to the schools . The district stopped painting classrooms about six years ago and paints school exteriors only every 20 years . Maintenance workers make only those repairs needed to ensure the health and safety of employees and students . Leaky pipes are fixed , but playground cracks are rarely filled . The district had 1 # 600 maintenance workers in 1986 . Teams of electricians , plumbers and carpenters spent a week at each school every year , fixing broken lights , unclogging water_fountains and repairing window_blinds , among other things . The district had 14 trailers for tools and equipment that the workers parked on campuses . The district also had specialists in furniture refinishing and repair of window_blinds . Today , the district has sold the trailers . Schools rely_on parents and community support to paint classrooms and spruce_up campuses . &quot; We don ' t have a preventive maintenance program ; we have a breakdown maintenance program , &quot; said Doug Brown , the district ' s facilities director . &quot; If ceiling tiles never present a safety or health hazard , they ' re never going_to be fixed or painted. &quot; But the quake represents an opportunity , several school officials acknowledged . Many schools finally will get modern texts that reflect the latest educational trends , including more literature and culturally sensitive narratives . Apple computers , most of which were donated , will be replaced with newer models that reflect technological advances . Kennedy High_School in Granada Hills , which reopened Feb . 22 in temporary classrooms , needs to replace $ 1.5 million in such materials . It is likely to get science equipment , such_as scales , that now are computerized and new charts and maps that are more up-to-date -- showing recent changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere . Teachers across the city are eager to replace old books -- some of which have gone_through 15 generations of students -- and other materials . They are dismayed that it took a disaster to spur the district into buying the latest materials and equipment . &quot; There ' s a certain irony in that it takes an earthquake to improve the schools that have been so cash-starved for so_long , &quot; said Gregg Solkovits , a teacher and union_representative at Monroe High_School in North Hills , where thousands of books were lost to water damage . &quot; We will be getting some needed repairs and needed materials as a result of a disaster . It ' s a pity it took an earthquake. &quot; Nonetheless , teachers and school_principals say even a fresh coat_of_paint or sparkling , white ceiling tiles will go_a_long_way . The deep cracks in the classroom walls at Audubon in the Crenshaw area are being repaired and textbooks have been ordered . &quot; We have sparkling ceilings already , &quot; said David Balok , assistant principal at Audubon . &quot; If a new coat_of_paint or a new ceiling will improve people ' s feelings , we ' ll take it , &quot; Balok said , adding that the school lost about $ 8 # 000 in teaching materials . &quot; It ' s too_bad it has to take a disaster . . . but sometimes through a disaster comes benefits. &quot; The quake-damaged walls at Rosemont Elementary in the Echo Park area will be replastered and painted to repair the cracks . &quot; I can ' t ever remember these walls being painted , &quot; said Rosemont Principal Wayne Langham . District officials estimate that about $ 5.5 million will be needed for new teaching materials , including computers and textbooks . Officials are figuring_out the total damage estimate , but preliminary reports show that it could range from $ 300 million to $ 700 million . At this point , FEMA has agreed to reimburse the state for 90 % of the earthquake damage and the state would be responsible_for 10 % . Gov . Pete Wilson has indicated that the school district might have to pay part of that amount . District lobbyists say they are working_on a variety of levels to ensure that the cash-strapped district does not have to pay_out of its funds . About 10 # 000 classrooms suffered damage , ranging from fallen ceiling tiles to shattered windows and broken cabinets . Board_of_Education members say the district needs to be completely reimbursed for repairs because of its tight budget . And , they say , the schools should reap some benefit . &quot; If there ' s a lighter side to this disaster , it ' s that the schools will be in better shape , &quot; board_member Julie Korenstein said . &quot; But schools were in such bad shape before the earthquake that it will take a lot ( of money ) . &quot; The district also is attempting to get money from FEMA to replace lights , ceiling tiles and lunch shelters , among other things , at schools that did not suffer quake damage . By upgrading those campuses , future earthquake damage could be minimized , officials say . &quot; We ' ve got_to replace things across the district , like metal-frame doors that jammed and lights that came crashing down on desks and window screens that couldn ' t be opened , &quot; said Brown , the facilities director . &quot; We need to bring our facilities up_to code. &quot; To the administrators , teachers and students , the quake ' s benefits will not go unnoticed . &quot; Some of the equipment we lost -- when it was purchased -- was state_of_the_art , &quot; said Morley , of the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies . &quot; But that was 10 or 15 years ago . Now we ' ll have higher_quality equipment that could improve education. &quot;</TEXT>
