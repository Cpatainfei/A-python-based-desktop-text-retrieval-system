   <HEADLINE> ATTACKER ' S UPCOMING PAROLE TESTS GALANTER ' S RECOVERY ; CRIME : COUNCILWOMAN HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES SINCE 1987 STABBING . NOW SHE MUST CONFRONT NEW ANGER , FEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seven years is long enough for wounds to heal . It ' s long enough for a voice that had been ripped away to regain much of its old strength . It ' s even long enough to reach an accommodation with fear . But for Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter , it is not nearly long enough to accept the impending freedom of the man who nearly killed her . On Monday , Mark Allen Olds will complete his prison sentence for the attempted murder of Galanter and be paroled to an undisclosed location in Northern California . And Galanter will be forced to find a new equilibrium with her old wounds . &quot; As it gets closer , I am reliving lots of what happened , &quot; Galanter said of Olds ' release . &quot; I don ' t like it any more this time than the last time . It is very painful. &quot; It may be hard for some to recall -- in a city that has since been bombarded with the videotaped images of the Rodney G . King beating , the 1992 riots and the ongoing O.J. Simpson murder case -- but the stabbing of Galanter in 1987 was one of the most stunning crimes of its time in Los Angeles . It happened in the spring of that year , in the pre-dawn darkness of Galanter ' s bedroom in Venice . Olds , a drug_user and onetime gang member , cut_through a screen and entered an open kitchen window before plunging a knife twice into Galanter ' s neck . At the time , the victim had just emerged from her relative obscurity as an urban planner and environmentalist to become the upstart challenger for a seat on the Los Angeles City_Council . She amazed police and paramedics by surviving her wounds , then inspired voters by staying in the race . In the end , she would upset one of the city ' s most powerful and enduring political figures , City_Council President Pat Russell , without ever leaving her hospital_bed . Seven years later , strangers still approach her in the supermarket to ask Galanter about her health . A policeman who was the first to find her that night stops to wish her well . And a young_woman at a reception praises Galanter for her courage , then breaks_down and cries . Galanter has been approached this way time and again , but &quot; it still shakes me up and comes at me sort of unexpectedly , &quot; she said . The most striking reminder of the crime , though , will come_with Olds ' release . Officials at the state_Department of Corrections declined to say exactly where the 34-year-old felon will be paroled , and Olds , through a prison spokeswoman , declined to be interviewed . Corrections officials said he will be under their supervision for three years . He will be forced to report regularly to a parole officer and be subject_to random home visits . Drug and alcohol tests will be administered . He will have to be home each night by 10 . Convicts are typically paroled into the county where they were convicted , but Olds will be released in Northern California , in part because Galanter has invoked her right as a victim of violent crime to have her attacker kept at least 35 miles from her home . For Galanter , 53 , a hard-earned sense_of_balance will be challenged by Olds ' release . She has taken all_the standard precautions . She owns two dogs and a more sophisticated alarm_system , installed after she joined the City_Council . She never leaves her windows unlocked at night . Los Angeles police officials have assured her they will be closely monitoring Olds ' progress . But the emotional weight of her attacker ' s freedom is still troubling . &quot; I have no reason to believe that he has it in_for me , &quot; Galanter said . &quot; But on the other hand , I have a friend who was attacked and raped . . . . When her attacker was let_out of jail she had no reason to think he would come_back , but it was very upsetting anyway. &quot; Olds confessed to the attack , but told a jury that he had not intended to harm Galanter . He said he came_to her two-bedroom bungalow -- across the street from a house he shared with a landlady and several other young_men -- in search of money or merchandise that would get him drugs . He said that he panicked when Galanter began to scream and stabbed her to stop the noise . As a result , the jury found that Olds had not planned the attack -- a crucial determination that meant he could only be convicted of second-degree attempted murder and not a premeditated , first-degree charge . The difference meant that Olds was sentenced to 14 years and four months in prison , instead of life . With standard credits for good behavior and work assignments , he served a little more_than half his time -- an outcome that Galanter still finds hard to accept . Nothing was stolen from the house that night and Galanter told the jury she did not scream until after she had been attacked . She still finds it hard to believe that Olds did not come_to her house intending to hurt her . To this day , Galanter said she is not sure why she was attacked . But on one point she is clear : &quot; I deeply resented that they didn ' t find premeditation . And the other issue that comes_up now , that is getting a lot more attention , is why people don ' t serve all_the time they get sentenced to. &quot; Galanter said she is no latecomer to her tough view on criminals . Although she is a liberal on most issues , she became a supporter of the death_penalty many years before her attack , after reading about the kidnap , rape and murder of a 2-year-old in Orange County . She had been a victim once before . When she was a 24-year-old graduate_student at Yale she was forced into her car at knifepoint and raped . Galanter says : &quot; I thought I had already had my hit in life . When this second ( attack ) came , that made_it seem extra unfair. &quot; Although the rape nearly 30 years ago left her without serious physical injuries , the marks of the stabbing are ever-present . A small crater behind Galanter ' s left ear marks the spot where the knife was first thrust . A patch of white skin remains where a second stab pierced a spot at the top of her esophagus . Thin white_lines run_down both sides of her neck , tracing where the surgeons went_in to repair the damage . The doctors ' work was remarkably successful , stopping the bleeding of a severed carotid_artery and patching the tube that takes food to the stomach . But four cranial_nerves could not be repaired . The result is that half of Galanter ' s vocal_cords and the left side of her esophagus remain permanently frozen . Her voice is thinner and raspier than before , although it has gained much of its old strength . When she swallows , there is the odd sensation that only half of her gullet is working . And the loss of another nerve has made_it impossible to raise her arm to vertical or to swim the crawl . It was the diminution of her voice that hit Galanter the hardest . &quot; She had this great resonant voice , &quot; said onetime aide Jim Bickhart . &quot; It projected really well and it had been a real tool for her in her public life . She felt crippled when that was taken from her. &quot; Still , despite frequent throat clearing and some apparent exertion , Galanter pronounces her voice now &quot; much better &quot; than before . As Olds ' release approaches , Galanter said , her emotional condition is harder to assess . She said she still gets twinges of anxiety when she sees her attacker ' s identical_twin , who was never a suspect in the case , near the boarding house where the two once lived . The white-haired landlady who owns the house , just across the street , once assured the world that Olds was innocent and she still glowers from her front step at Galanter . Eugenia Easton said she blames the councilwoman for unwanted police attention , then quickly slammed her door in a reporter ' s face , saying : &quot; You people just want to stir_up trouble. &quot; Although Galanter has made many friends in the neighborhood and seen &quot; the best side of people , &quot; she also can feel suddenly &quot; saddened and disillusioned &quot; walking in her neighborhood . It was here , after all , that she almost lost her life and that she can no longer open her windows , even on hot summer nights . With the days growing shorter , she finds herself hurrying home from walks with her dogs , fearful of being caught_out after dark . &quot; It sometimes makes me nervous , &quot; she said , referring to Olds ' release . &quot; But at_the_same_time , I am going_to try to live my life as normally as I can. &quot; Many friends and acquaintances ask why she simply didn ' t move away . &quot; That was something , just to walk back through that door into that house , &quot; said Marcela Howell , who ran Galanter ' s campaign against Russell . &quot; It showed a_level of courage. &quot; Galanter has had passing thoughts of moving , but there is an abiding anger that keeps her there . &quot; I paid_for that house , &quot; she said . &quot; I earned the right to be in that neighborhood . And I deserve to live there. &quot; Her perseverance continues to resonate , particularly among women . They are most often the ones who stop her to offer their good wishes -- like the young_woman from Vermont who recently stopped Galanter at a reception to say she admired her . &quot; Basically , what happened to me is the nightmare of every woman who lives alone , &quot; Galanter said . &quot; So many of the people who talk to me and say they prayed for me are women who lived alone. &quot; If anything positive came_out of the attack , Galanter said , it is this quiet alliance with people she had never known . &quot; That is really nice . It makes me feel_like there really is a community here. &quot;</TEXT>
