   <HEADLINE> JIM BAKKER ENTERS HALFWAY HOUSE AFTER SERVING 4 1 / 2 YEARS IN PRISON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jim Bakker returned Friday to the state where his lucrative TV ministry began , arriving_at a halfway house after 4 1 / 2 years in prison for defrauding investors out of millions of dollars . &quot; I ' m glad to be back in the Carolinas , and I ' m glad to be with my son today , &quot; said Bakker , who built his religious empire , Heritage USA , near Charlotte . &quot; I ' m excited to be anywhere. &quot; Accompanied by his teen-age son , Jamie , and his attorney , the former PTL leader arrived_at a Salvation_Army halfway house shortly after 11 a.m. He had left a minimum-security prison in Jesup , Ga. , about seven hours earlier and flew to this city in the Blue Ridge Mountains , where he must stay until Dec . 1 . Bakker , 53 , was convicted in 1989 of defrauding thousands of his followers who sent him at least $ 1 # 000 each in return for promised lodging at Heritage USA for three days and four nights every year for the rest of their lives . During his trial , prosecutors said the scheme brought_about $ 158 million into PTL from far more people than Heritage USA could accommodate . Rather than building promised hotels for his followers , Bakker spent their contributions to live_in luxury himself . Bakker chatted for a_few minutes Friday with reporters before going inside the one-story brick halfway house . Bakker will live with about 15 other men at the center and be driven to a job in the area . Bakker ' s attorney , Jim Toms , would not comment on reports that Bakker ' s job would be at his law office in nearby Hendersonville . &quot; I can ' t think_of a better place in the world for Jim Bakker to be than the Salvation_Army , &quot; Toms said after bringing his client a turkey club_sandwich and a slice of Key_lime pie for lunch . Jamie Bakker will live_in the Hendersonville area until his father is released from the halfway house , Toms said .</TEXT>
