   <TEXT> In your otherwise admirable editorial on the menace of the trade_in black_market plutonium ( Aug . 19 ) , you state , &quot; Even in the chilliest Cold_War days , international civilian terrorism was one area in which East-West cooperation could usually be counted on. &quot; I have to take_issue with that.After all , the Czech communist government was one of the chief weapons suppliers to terrorists , from Libya to the IRA , besides providing medical treatment and rest and relaxation facilities for terrorists . The KGB surely knew of these activities , and did nothing to stop them . Indeed , the former Soviet_Union itself was the site of various training_schools for terrorists , including Palestinians and others . On those occasions when the Soviets cooperated it was likely to be because Soviet nationals had been victims of terrorism in one form or another . But the general Soviet attitude was that terrorism served their interests , and they were hardly paragons of virtue in cooperating to bring international pressure on various terrorist groups .
