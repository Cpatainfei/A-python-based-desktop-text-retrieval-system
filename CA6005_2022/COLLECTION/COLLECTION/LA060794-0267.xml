   <TEXT> When the &quot; Star Wars &quot; craze was raging in the United States , Dennis Ting ' s companies produced R2-D2 plastic figurines -- 80 million of them . Cabbage Patch Dolls ? Ten million of the stuffed creatures . Mighty Morphin Power Rangers -- Jason , Trini , Zach , Kimberly , Billy ? Ting makes jillions of them along with disgusting plastic things called Burp Balls , anti-gravity toy cars that drive on the ceiling and Susie Scribbles , a near life-size doll who sits at a desk and &quot; can write anything she says. &quot; The showroom in his Kowloon headquarters is a child ' s delight and a parent ' s nightmare of large and small plastic toys . Ting , cherubic and constantly grinning during an interview in his spacious office decorated with equally cherubic Buddhist sculpture , is one of the Hong Kong toy tycoons . His products , manufactured just across the border in China , are a $ 9-billion-a-year business and dominate the world ' s toy market . According to the Toy Manufacturers of America , more_than 60 % of all toys , dolls , games and Christmas decorations are made in China and enter the U.S. market via the Hong Kong connection . Ting , chairman_of_the_board of Kader Holdings Co . Ltd . and managing director of Qualidux Industrial Co . Ltd. , two of Hong Kong ' s largest toy manufacturers , entered the business in the early 1950s after emigrating to Hong Kong with his family from his native Shanghai . In Shanghai , the family had manufactured dry-cell batteries and brass flashlights . But after seeing the waterproof plastic flashlights carried by American GI ' s who arrived in Shanghai after World_War_II , the family envisioned a future made of plastic . In Hong Kong , their first foray_into plastic production met with failure after molds they ordered from the United States , for the manufacture of chopsticks and hair combs , did not work . But Ting , educated in the United States at Colby College in Maine , said the setback was a blessing because it forced the family into the business of making its own molds . Soon they were producing the chassis for toy plastic cars and the plastic fixtures for Lionel trains . Gradually , Hong Kong replaced Japan as the world ' s leading manufacturing center for toys . In 1980 , facing an increasingly expensive Hong Kong labor_market , Ting and all_of the other Hong Kong toy makers began moving their manufacturing operations across the border to China , in the &quot; special economic zone &quot; created in Shenzhen by the Chinese government . Ting ' s two companies have 15 # 000 employees in China . Overall , Hong Kong toy makers with plants in China employ an estimated 300 # 000 workers . Often conditions in factories that make American children ' s playthings are not pleasant or safe . In Thailand , for instance , Ting ' s Kader Holdings was half-owner of a Bangkok toy factory that collapsed and burned last year , killing 240 workers . But Ting said his companies ' Chinese factories are all made of concrete to prevent such a tragedy . &quot; We have regular fire_drills , three firefighters on staff , &quot; he said .
