   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH : YORBA LINDA ; NO-SMOKING AREA AT RESTAURANTS EXPANDED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The city ' s smoking ordinance was amended Tuesday to increase the seating_area restaurant owners must set_aside for nonsmoking customers . Beginning Aug . 18 , restaurants must have a nonsmoking area that takes_up at least 70 % of the business ' seating capacity.Currently , the ordinance calls_for 33 % of the restaurant to be reserved for nonsmokers . Tuesday ' s action was the latest salvo in a months-long battle over a proposed ban on smoking in public places . Councilman John M . Gullixson introduced the amendment last month in response to an earlier amendment proposed by Councilman Henry W . Wedaa that would have eliminated smoking completely from restaurants , places of employment and other public places . Most restaurants in the city already set_aside 70 % for nonsmokers , Gullixson said . &quot; I don ' t think we need a law ( restricting smoking ) because the public has already forced business owners to do that on_their_own , &quot; Gullixson said . &quot; I introduced the 70 % ( ordinance ) as an attempt to compromise. &quot; Other businesses covered by the city ' s smoking ordinance were not affected by the amendment . An advisory measure asking residents if the city should ban smoking in all public places including restaurants is scheduled to be_on the November ballot . The City_Council will reconsider whether to keep the advisory measure on the ballot at its Aug . 2 meeting . DANIELLE A . FOUQUETTE</TEXT>
