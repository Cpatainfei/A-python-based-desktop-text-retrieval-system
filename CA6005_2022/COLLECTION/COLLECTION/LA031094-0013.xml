   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON AIDS ; SAFER SEX HAS TO BE FOREVER ; IF HUMAN BEHAVIOR TRIGGERED THE EPIDEMIC , HUMAN BEHAVIOR COULD QUELL IT . BUT THAT CALLS FOR PERMANENT CHANGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gay and AIDS activists , even at the risk of providing fodder for homophobes , need to examine how AIDS developed , and the reason is soberingly simple . Researchers are virtually unanimous in believing that if AIDS were cured tomorrow and we returned to the ways of the 1970s , the whole nightmare could easily happen again . Scientists are confident that what can be amplified by one form of human behavior can be prevented by another . Among the most critical contributions the gay community has made in responding to AIDS has been the invention and promotion of safer_sex , which remains the most important means of preventing HIV transmission today . Overcoming great resistance , gay_men and lesbians -- after a period of adjustment -- reacted with remarkable decisiveness , effectiveness and often nobility to the challenge of safer_sex . The most impressive evidence of this was a subsequently lowered rate of HIV transmission in places like San Francisco , where the epidemic was at its peak . But an important reason for examining the genesis of the epidemic itself is to lay the framework for prevention on a macro scale -- not individual cases , but of AIDS II : the Sequel . Researchers have already identified several microbes capable of spawning deadly new plagues if the conditions of the 1970s are re-created , starting , most obviously , with HIV-2 and the cancer-causing HTLV retroviruses . Now drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases have evolved , making these infections harder to treat , especially for those with HIV . There are probably many others -- rare , death-dealing microbes -- unnoticed as HIV was long unnoticed , eking out a meager existences in the global bloodstream . Waiting . Yet as we move_into the second decade of AIDS without a cure in_sight , many cannot resist the siren song of unsafe sex . According to the San Francisco health department , the rate of newly infected gay_men recently doubled in the Bay Area , with many cases among young gay_men . Epidemiologists say the same thing is happening in other gay communities . Focus groups have elicited several explanations for the relapse , including fatalism , survivor guilt and a desire to join what some bizarrely consider a culture of heightened meaning among the HIV-positive . But a significant reason gay_men gave investigators was the belief that safer_sex is just too stressful , even unnatural , to maintain for very long . &quot; Safe_sex is not incorporated naturally into a life , &quot; a Bay Area man told reporter Jane Gross of the New York Times recently . &quot; OK , three years ; OK , five years ; OK , eight years . But the rest of my life ? No . that ' s not possible. &quot; His view is widely echoed even by many who practice safer_sex but who look_forward to the end of AIDS not just for personal salvation or the salvation of their friends but so that they can return to the multipartner practices of the swinging ' 70s . Perhaps ironically , those practices are now becoming more popular within lesbian circles even as AIDS rises among women . Yet the lesson of AIDS , or at least one lesson of AIDS , is that until all viruses have been defeated , the kind of gay sexual activism that has contributed to AIDS remains incompatible with survival . If gay_men in particular are to survive , the real challenge of liberation will not be to resist that lesson but to organize around it . Even if such a major readjustment is possible , many would view it with deep suspicion . Historian Martin Duberman cites powerful arguments against accepting any seemingly moralistic , anti-sex lesson from AIDS : &quot; The powers that be have always used epidemics in_order to reinforce moral lessons . And epidemics , because they involve so_much terror , are very good enforcers of the code. &quot; True enough . But in the past , the powers that be did not know the facts about plagues . It is one thing for moralists to misinterpret epidemics as God ' s wrath and use such interpretations to suggest tattooing gays . It is quite another for rationalists to explore the interlinked mechanisms of epidemics and provide resulting knowledge that can be applied to prevention and protection . To be effective on the individual level , we have learned that safer_sex has to be every time . The history of AIDS indicates that to be effective on the macro level , it will have to be all_the time , for all humankind . And not just for the duration of the epidemic . Forever . Or at least until the viral world has been vanquished .</TEXT>
