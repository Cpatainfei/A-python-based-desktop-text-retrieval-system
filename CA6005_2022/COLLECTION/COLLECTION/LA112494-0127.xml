   <HEADLINE> PLAYHOUSE : EFFORTS TO RETROFIT THE BUILDING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although I now live_in Maryland , I am deeply interested in the continued welfare and progress in my chosen &quot; hometown &quot; of Santa Monica . I feel qualified by my interest and experience as a former Landmarks Commissioner to comment regarding a matter I understand is now in the hands of Santa Monica officials for consideration : earthquake retrofitting , restoration , and future operation and maintenance of the Miles Playhouse and selection of a nonprofit organization to carry_out the project . The Miles Playhouse lay_in a heap of rubble the day after the January earthquake . I , and other Landmarks Commissioners , had been reviewing the prospects for earthquake reinforcement of the building for quite some time . The catastrophic destruction , instead of discouraging us , only intensified our concern that its retrofitting and restoration be started as soon as possible . It is not necessary to detail the historic significance of the Miles Playhouse to the community . This designated Santa Monica Landmark has already been documented by others more highly qualified than I . Considering the cost and effort required to retrofit it to earthquake standards , restore and preserve it , as well as maintain and operate the structure in the future for the greatest benefit of the community , it appears almost axiomatic that the undertaking would require a concerted effort by a dedicated and fully self-supporting effective community organization . For almost 20 years , the Santa Monica Historical Society has performed its important goals as established through the Santa Monica Centennial Committee on its inception . It has persevered to preserve local history , to encourage others in the community , particularly students , to be proud_of their heritage and participate in preserving Santa Monica ' s few remaining historic structures , to research the history and make available to the community at_large , historians and others researching the area ' s cultural heritage , its collections of multicultural memorabilia , artifacts , oral history , documents and other resource materials . The society has managed to provide a dignified , articulate and relevant historical museum and cultural resource center appealing_to all ages and diverse ethnic and interest_groups in the community in whatever location it had at the time . This , in spite of difficult economic times and many moves from one location to another in its quest to find a permanent home for its vast collections . At the present_time , the Santa Monica Museum of History and Cultural Resource Center is located at 1539 Euclid St . The number and variety of visitors to the museum , and their unsolicited comments , indicate that this venture has been successful despite constraints of space and lack of an appropriate ambience ( not a historic structure ) . While not profitable in the sense of a commercial venture , the growing membership of the society has continued to support the museum and its other activities promoting Santa Monica ' s history throughout the community without relying_on public city funds . I am not on-site or sufficiently familiar_with the floor_plans to detail exactly how the building might most effectively be used . However , it seems to me that we have two needs in our community for which the fulfillment of each might be found by fitting them together like the missing pieces of a puzzle . First , we have a designated Santa Monica Landmark in urgent need of funding to cover expenses of retrofitting and restoration . This work must be started soon to prevent further deterioration of the structure . It will require the concentrated effort of a strong volunteer group to finance , operate and maintain the structure for the future . Second , we have a historical society that critically needs as soon as possible a permanent location for its museum and collections of historical artifacts , memorabilia , documents and resource materials . The most appropriate location would be in a structure of historical significance to the community . The Santa Monica Historical Society has already proven its ability to forge a cohesive and effective membership willing -- and able -- to provide the organizational and financial_support needed for this project . The society , of which I am still a member , is aware of -- and qualified to apply for -- various grants and funds available to a nonprofit organization for preserving such a landmark as the Miles Playhouse . In addition , the society has the capability of mounting a communitywide fund-raising_campaign and access to private funds to carry_out this endeavor . The pieces of the puzzle seem to me to be a perfect fit . One could quibble and nit-pick for years . I am sure that such activity is now going_on in the community . Many organizations want the Miles Playhouse for their pet project . However , it would be a travesty to rely_on an unproven organization without a track record of raising sufficient resources or marshaling the necessary volunteer support to undertake such a monumental venture . I urge every civic-minded resident of Santa Monica to look carefully at the solution to the two community needs which I propose . I believe that after serious consideration the entire community will come_together to support the Santa Monica Historical Society in restoring the Miles Playhouse . GERI M . LITVAK , Ft .
