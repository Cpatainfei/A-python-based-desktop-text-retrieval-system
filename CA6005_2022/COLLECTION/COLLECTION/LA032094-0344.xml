   <HEADLINE> DANA PARSONS : SECOND_THOUGHTS ABOUT ' BARBAROUS ' ACTS AGAINST RAPISTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We know we have an imperfect justice system , but do we have to be reminded of it so starkly ? And so often ? An imperfect system often creates problems without solutions ; one sure sign of a problem without a solution is that it prompts public officials -- apparently driven to say something -- to make inane or misguided remarks . Gov . Wilson and Orange County ' s state Sen . Marian Bergeson filled that role nicely in the_matter surrounding the imminent prison release of convicted serial rapist Melvin Carter . More on that later . Carter ' s parole , after a criminal career in which he confessed to more_than 100 rapes , comes at roughly the midpoint of a 25-year sentence . The current plan is to release him in the small , remote northern California community of Alturas , the backup choice after Bay Area citizens created a ruckus when it was suggested Carter go there . Most of us subscribe , if sometimes grudgingly , to the notion of allowing ex-cons the chance at a new life after paying their debt to society . In our minds , though , we ' re thinking of the burglar , the forger , the hit-and-run driver and , yes , depending_on the circumstances , sometimes even the murderer . But it stretches anyone ' s sense of fair play to ask society to take_back someone with more_than 100 rapes against his name . Even more dangerous than someone who killed in a moment of passion or anger , a serial rapist who has reached triple figures has , it seems to me , forfeited any legitimate right to live among us . that ' s why the system is so vexing , because Carter is being paroled according to the letter of the law . He ' s eligible for early release because he ' s been a good prisoner . It ' s almost comical to note that he hasn ' t raped a woman during his entire incarceration . For that , he ' s entitled to parole . My impulse would have been to give him , at best , a cookie . I ' m sure the governor doesn ' t want Carter released , either , but he sounded horribly callous when he suggested it ' s better to have him in a remote area than in a populated one . Lapsing into his sometimes odd-sounding tough-guy talk , Wilson called Carter an &quot; animal &quot; who should be released &quot; out_in the wilderness someplace where he will have absolutely the least possible opportunity to hurt another young woman. &quot; That must have been very comforting to the women of Alturas . Wilson also supports Bergeson ' s bill that would give life sentences without parole to first-time rapists and child_molesters . Let ' s hope the Legislature is not so far around the bend on crime that it considers passing such an extreme measure . But it isn ' t Wilson ' s fault Carter won ' t do his 25 years . So , what to do with the Melvin Carters of the world , who at 49 is not beyond his physical potential as a rapist ? Please indulge me while I borrow from New Yorker magazine . In its lead essay in the March 7 issue , the historically liberal magazine raised the question of voluntary castration of repeat sex offenders in exchange for sentencing considerations . The essay quoted from studies indicating that sex criminals repeat their crimes more often than do other offenders , often committing &quot; an appalling number of them. &quot; The magazine pointed_out that one of every six offenders in state and federal prisons is a sex offender . Ideally , the sex offenders would learn in prison how to curb their tendencies , but , obviously , many do not . &quot; Why , then , &quot; the New Yorker asks , &quot; resist the demands of men who are willing to risk sacrificing sexual_activity in_order to be free_of their damaging impulses ? &quot; The magazine noted that , far from being barbaric , the technique is used in at least eight Western countries . Arguments that castration , even voluntary , is immoral amounts to &quot; an odd double_standard , &quot; the New Yorker noted . Citing for comparative purposes women who choose to have their uterus removed because of excessive premenstrual tension or those who choose to have abortions , the essay then adds , with mock disdain : &quot; But a man who molests children or brutalizes women can ' t ask to have his testicles removed , because that would be barbarous. &quot; The essay concluded by noting , &quot; Our society is so squeamish when it comes_to discussing sexual deviance that we tend to demonize sex offenders , forgetting that in many cases they themselves are victims , not only of sexual abuse in their own childhood but also of their overwhelming sexual impulses . Most of them , every time they exercise their sexual preference , break the law . It amounts to fraud when we offer these men treatment that doesn ' t work . If castration helps , why not let them have what they want ? &quot; It has been argued over the years that rape is a crime of violence , not sex . Other studies challenge that . Wherever the truth lies , it probably is not a distinction that means a great_deal to the vast majority of women . Two things are certain in the meantime : Prisons will continue filling_up with sex offenders , some who may get increasingly violent in light of the new &quot; three strikes &quot; provision , and women will continue fearing the_likes_of a Melvin Carter suddenly at_large in their town .</TEXT>
