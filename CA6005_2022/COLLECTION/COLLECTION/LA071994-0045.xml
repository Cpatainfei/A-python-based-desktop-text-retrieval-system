   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; SADDAM ' S PUBLIC ENEMY NO . 1 ; KURDISH LEADER AHMED CHALABI HAS LIVED MANY LIVES , FROM MATHEMATICIAN TO FALLEN BANKER TO FEARLESS FOE OF IRAQ ' S DICTATOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It takes some nerve to set yourself up as the No . 1 enemy of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . To do so while living openly just 200 miles north of Baghdad would seem to be inviting an assassin ' s bullet , if not a Scud missile . But a smile never seems to be far from the lips of Ahmed Chalabi , who takes_in stride his many roles as brilliant mathematician , fallen Jordanian banker and principal opposition coordinator against the Arab world ' s most ruthless regime . &quot; We ' re not in exile . We ' re here , &quot; the 49-year-old Chalabi said proudly , relaxing at midnight in designer trousers and a sweat shirt in his luxurious home_in the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan , picking fruit from a low table piled high with fresh watermelons , peaches and cucumbers . Chalabi has indeed made his mark in Iraq . He is credited with a major role in averting civil_war in May between factions of the 3.5 million ethnic Kurds living_in the north . An all-out conflict would have wrecked their democratic experiment and gravely embarrassed the United States and Western allies who have protected them from Hussein ' s forces since the Persian_Gulf_War ended in 1991 . Chalabi did not act alone ; foreign relief agencies also mediated between the rival Kurdish leaderships . But both sides testify to his bravery in heading into front_lines where battles were in_progress . &quot; You have to have the strength of your convictions . You can ' t ask people to risk lives unless they see you are ready to do_it , &quot; Chalabi said . Along the way , Chalabi ' s peacemaking efforts made a name for the Iraqi National Congress ( INC ) , the otherwise obscure umbrella group of organizations fighting to oust Hussein . Their white-and-green flag is now a common sight on peacekeeping checkpoints , its three interlocking circles symbolizing the three main communities of Iraq : Sunni Muslims , Shiite Muslims and the Kurds . Three well-known leaders of these communities were elected as a leadership council at the INC ' s first congress in the old mountain resort town of Salahuddin in 1992 . Chalabi , the INC ' s mentor , was appointed president of the executive_council to run the group from day to day . &quot; Chalabi started the ( intra-Kurdish ) mediation initiative . There was nobody else . Everybody was listening to him , &quot; said Ferman Jabbar , a military_leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , a member of the INC and also one of the two main factions feuding for power in Iraqi Kurdistan . ( Kurdistan spans parts of Iraq , Iran , Syria , Turkey and territories of the former Soviet_Union but hasn ' t achieved independence in modern times. ) &quot; Arab radios are now talking_about the INC . The mediation showed they can do something , &quot; said Sami Abdulrahman , who leads the other faction , the Kurdish Democratic Party , also an INC founding group . There is no doubting Chalabi ' s winning mix of intelligence , charm and organizational ability . He commands the same warm respect from a beefy warlord like Jabbar , who favors a Serb-style forage cap and keeps pet eagles , as from bearded Muslim activists in_charge of groups like the Revolutionary Kurdish Hezbollah . Integrity is a more slippery subject in this atmosphere , where all have a gun in their belt and an enemy not far away . Chalabi declines to answer questions about how he funds an organization with photocopiers , TV studios and walkie-talkie radios on the hip of every staffer . He denied the widespread belief that he gets covert U.S. funding . His intra-Kurdish mediation , however , has won him official Western approval . Chalabi proudly showed_off faxed letters from Britain ' s Foreign Office and the U.S. State_Department . The INC ' s mediation was &quot; a welcome contribution , &quot; said Peter Tarnoff , the State_Department ' s undersecretary of state for political affairs . Chalabi has come a long way in winning trust from the West since 1989 , when Petra Bank , the second-biggest bank in Jordan with $ 1.4 billion in loans , came spectacularly unglued under his presidency . A year later it was closed_down . Jordanian Central_Bank Gov . Muhammed Said Nabulsi accused Chalabi of &quot; fraud , embezzlement and illicit transactions. &quot; Chalabi fled Jordan but was never formally charged . The bank affair remains mysterious . Chalabi says he had been feeding information to the West about Saddam Hussein ' s arms-buying ploys , and he maintains the bankruptcy was all an Iraqi plot mixed with Jordanian palace politics . &quot; In the end , it was too hard to have one ' s own country against one , &quot; he said . He should know . Chalabi was born into a prominent Baghdad Shiite Muslim family : His father was president of the old Iraqi Senate , and his grandfather was a long-serving education minister . But the family was forced to leave Iraq in the 1950s during the revolutionary ferment that eventually led to Saddam Hussein ' s takeover . Chalabi then studied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before earning his doctorate at the University of Chicago . He was teaching at the American University of Beirut , he says , when the Jordanian crown_prince invited him to Amman to found Petra Bank . Today , Chalabi appears to enjoy and excel in the high-stakes skills of Middle Eastern leadership : coaxing feuding factions into making_peace and , failing that , dealing with war . Travel , for instance , is never without a cavalcade of four-wheel-drive battlewagons loaded with weaponry . His chief aide was an Iraqi secret_agent in Paris before changing sides . The INC ' s offices , a television studio bristling with antennas and an INC guest house , have gradually moved_into more and more houses in Salahuddin . The INC has set_up two training camps to receive groups of Iraqi army defectors and local Kurdish recruits , who total perhaps 750 soldiers . Some are now serving on checkpoints dividing the front_lines , but many are new_to the job . Even more unusual is Chalabi ' s headquarters . His warren of offices is packed with armed retainers , satellite telephones , the latest computers and schematic flow-charts of Iraqi army divisions in the north . Chalabi claims some of the best inside knowledge of the Iraqi officer corps . He is particularly delighted with one prank cooked_up in Salahuddin : the publication and distribution in Baghdad of a spoof edition of the Iraqi newspaper Babel . Looking superficially just like the original , the news columns gave details of Hussein ' s human-rights violations . The INC staff_members are young , bright and enthusiastic , but for all their energy , the organization remains something of a one-man show . Masoud Barzani , chief of the Kurdish Democratic Party and tribal leader of hundreds of thousands of Kurds , noted : &quot; The INC ' s role is very great , but it alone cannot do very much. &quot; Kamran Karadaghi , a leading commentator on Iraqi affairs for the London newspaper Al Hayat , said Chalabi ' s very success was generating jealousy within the INC . At the best of times , the group can only just hold together rival wings that range from Islamists to Communists , backed by all_the feuding states in the Middle Eastern kaleidoscope . Chalabi denies that he is_after Hussein ' s job or anything more_than the INC ' s official aim -- to oust Hussein and bring democracy to Baghdad . The former banker did a quick calculation : Iraq owes $ 100 billion to Western banks and governments , faces claims of $ 240 billion in war indemnities from Kuwait , and Iran claims $ 900 billion more in damages for the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War . &quot; that ' s as much as all_the oil in Iraq is worth , &quot; Chalabi said . &quot; Anyone who wants to take power in Baghdad is crazy . I am just in this to get_rid_of Saddam. &quot; Biography Name : Ahmed Chalabi Title : President of the Executive_Council of the Iraqi National Congress .
