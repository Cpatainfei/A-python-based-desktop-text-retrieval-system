   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; PRESIDENT EMPLOYS FEAR TO URGE SUPPORT FOR EAST ; POLICY : CLINTON RAISES SPECTER OF RUSSIA ' S COLLAPSE TO CAUTION AMERICA . HE WARNS EUROPE CHAOS COULD SPREAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton ' s appeal Sunday for a new , post-Cold War partnership between the United States and Europe centered_on two pointed messages of fear , one aimed at Americans and one at Europeans . To Americans , Clinton issued a warning : The collapse of Russia or other East European democracies could draw the United States into war just as earlier crises pulled the nation into World_War I and World_War_II . To Europeans , he cast the warning in the form of a plea : Join the United States in stepping_up aid and trade with the nations of the East , despite the pain of the recession now racking Western Europe , lest Russia ' s chaos spread . &quot; For the peoples who broke communism ' s chains , we now see a race between rejuvenation and despair , &quot; Clinton warned , pitting &quot; the heirs of the Enlightenment , who seek to consolidate freedom ' s gain . . . ( against ) the grim pretenders to tyranny ' s dark throne. &quot; The North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , he added , must continue to defend the West as long as &quot; the dream of empire still burns in the minds of some who look longingly toward a brutal past. &quot; His words were foreboding , and his tone was grim . But among the President ' s aides , there was satisfaction . After a year of uncertainty , they believe that they have found a convincing new mission for the U.S.-European alliance : holding_back the tide of nationalism in the troubled East . Ironically , they owe that new clarity in part to Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , the ultranationalist who surprised the West -- and shook the East -- with his unexpected strength in Russia ' s parliamentary election last month . Even before the election , Clinton and his aides had worked_out a proposal to extend NATO ' s defense cooperation gradually and gingerly into Eastern Europe , a plan they have dubbed the &quot; Partnership for Peace. &quot; But to bring_home his concern on Sunday , Clinton appeared to have taken the advice given President Harry S . Truman in 1947 -- that he should &quot; scare hell out of the American people &quot; to rally support for the &quot; containment &quot; of the Soviet_Union . Clinton ' s aides said they intended this speech to be as historic as those Truman gave at the opening of the Cold_War . &quot; Five years from now , we hope this is remembered as the day the President defined a new security framework for Europe , &quot; his national security adviser , Anthony Lake , said . This time , Clinton said , the security of Western Europe and the United States must be protected by making_sure that Russia and its neighbors succeed in their political and economic reforms -- and by keeping NATO military defenses ready in case they fail . &quot; We want to prepare_for the worst and hope for the best , &quot; a senior Clinton aide said . In a sense , it is a policy of &quot; pre-containment &quot; -- of trying to ward_off the rise of authoritarian rule_in Moscow , and working to limit its effect in_advance . Will it work ? For Clinton to succeed in matching Truman ' s achievement , he must struggle against three obstacles . One is the Europeans ' preoccupation with their own economic woes and a general lack of leadership on a continent of weak and aging governments . Germany , for example , which lies closest to Eastern Europe , complains that it has already spent almost $ 90 billion in aid to Russia and could stomach little more . Another obstacle is the unpredictability of day-by-day events in Russia and its neighbors , caught_up as they are in the throes of revolutionary economic and political change . Clinton called Sunday for something Presidents rarely extol : &quot; humility -- understanding that we cannot control every event in every country on every day. &quot; And a third is domestic : not the support of the American people , who by surprisingly large margins have backed continued U.S. aid to Russia , but Clinton ' s own domestic agenda and its demands on his time and energy . Until now , the President has refused to commit much time to foreign_policy , except when compelled by crisis . That damaged U.S. relations with European_countries in 1993 . &quot; The transatlantic relationship just wasn ' t tended the way it traditionally had been , &quot; said Rozanne Ridgway , a former assistant secretary_of_state .</TEXT>
