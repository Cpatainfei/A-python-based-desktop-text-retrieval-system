   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; LAWMAKERS SUPPORT PEACE MISSION , BUT STILL BALK AT INVASION ; CONGRESS : CARTER DELEGATION IS APPLAUDED , DESPITE CRITICISM OF ITS TIMING AND MANDATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Key members of Congress expressed bipartisan support Saturday for President Clinton ' s last-ditch Haitian diplomatic initiative but warned that they would continue to seek a vote opposing an invasion if Clinton ' s emissaries failed to persuade Haiti ' s military dictators to step aside . &quot; I strongly support this mission , &quot; said Sen . Claiborne Pell ( D-R.I. ) , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . &quot; But I am still of the view we should not go_in . There are no U.S. interests justifying military action. &quot; Even as some of the most outspoken foes of Clinton ' s saber-rattling grudgingly applauded his decision to send a delegation led by former President Jimmy_Carter to Haiti , they criticized the timing and the scope of the group ' s mandate . &quot; I wish it had been done long ago , before we had an invasion force off the shore of Haiti , &quot; said Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) . &quot; And I would like their charter to discuss a wide variety of issues rather than just the circumstances of the military ' s departure. &quot; Senators and representatives interviewed Saturday generally said that they do not expect to get an opportunity to cast a vote opposing military_action . Rather , they predicted that if an eleventh-hour diplomatic settlement is not reached this weekend , Clinton will send_in the forces poised just off Haiti ' s shores shortly before a scheduled vote by the House on Monday . Sentiment on Capitol_Hill has run overwhelmingly against an invasion . Hence many lawmakers , particularly Democrats who do not relish the prospect of opposing their President on a major foreign_policy issue , breathed a sigh of relief over the decision to send Carter , retired Army Gen . Colin L . Powell and Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) to meet with Haiti ' s military_leaders . They said the makeup of this high-powered trio would serve Clinton well not only during their mission but also -- if they return empty-handed -- back home . Nunn and Powell , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff during the George_Bush Administration , carry particular clout with Congress . Their credibility is further enhanced by their independence from the President who dispatched them : Nunn has been a constant thorn in Clinton ' s side on military_issues , and Powell , who served a Republican President , is considered a possible opponent of Clinton ' s in 1996 . As the delegation landed in Haiti , lawmakers said the possibility of averting bloodshed is more important than any perception of indecisiveness by a President who has been accused of waffling on a host of other foreign_policy issues . &quot; It ' s in everyone ' s interests that the effort be made , &quot; said Sen . William S . Cohen ( R-Me. ) , a member of the Armed Services Committee . Cohen said the prospect for success was enhanced last week when Jean-Bertrand Aristide , the exiled Haitian president , vowed that upon his return his government would not seek vengeance against members of the military led by Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras . This , he said , could allow Powell to deliver a powerful message to Cedras and his two associates whose departure has been demanded by Clinton . &quot; Powell ' s stature is such_that he can make this very clear that it would be an unconscionable act for them to inflict on their soldiers , causing these soldiers to die for their leadership when they could , instead , live under a democratic administration , &quot; Cohen said . &quot; Colin Powell is the best person to make that appeal. &quot; If this and other entreaties by the Carter-led emissaries fail , the trio could emerge as influential political allies of Clinton . This would depend , however , on their message . &quot; Having three such prestigious figures , including the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , coming_back and saying , ' We have no alternative but to carry_out this invasion , ' would be extremely positive , &quot; said a senior Democratic congressional aide . &quot; You will then have three very powerful voices that will help give Congress a rationale for letting the invasion go forward. &quot; Others were skeptical . Pell said this development would only modestly decrease opposition to Clinton ' s plans . And Cohen said the narrow scope of the mission -- to discuss with the Haitians only their means of departure -- meant the Administration could not say , &quot; We tried every alternative. &quot; Two House Democrats who generally support Clinton said they expect to continue to oppose an invasion if the diplomatic initiative does not produce a breakthrough . &quot; If they ' re unsuccessful , I ' m not sure how much it will change , &quot; said Rep . Patricia Schroeder ( D-Colo. ) , a member of the House Armed Services Committee . &quot; The people who are upset about it can ' t figure_out what the national interest is , and Carter going there does not define the national interest. &quot; Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) , who chairs a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee , said he detests the brutality of the Haitian regime and wants to see U.S. foreign assistance and diplomatic policy used to promote democracy abroad . But he drew_the_line at military_action . &quot; For the life of me , &quot; Berman said , &quot; I cannot understand the underlying conceptual justification for using U.S. military_forces where there ' s no U.S. security_interest , there ' s no fundamental U.S. economic interest and there has been no aggression against one country by another. &quot; Sen . Patrick J . Leahy ( D-Vt. ) was one of a minority of lawmakers who said that he would not oppose an invasion if it came_to a vote . For better or worse , he said , Clinton put his credibility on the line by vowing to invade unless Cedras and his cronies left Haiti .</TEXT>
