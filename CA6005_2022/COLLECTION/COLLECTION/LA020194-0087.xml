   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; MAKING ANOTHER DESERT BLOOM ; EGYPT ' S BIG PLANS FOR THE SINAI FEATURE A $ 1.4-BILLION NILE CANAL , MILLIONS OF SETTLERS AND A STRING OF COASTAL RESORTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The peaked sands that fed and bewitched the children of Israel over 40 years of biblical history roll_out to the end of the sky , and in their midst , clinging_to a tenuous life , have sprung these few acres of new-sprouted olives , vegetables and tiny brick houses , battered by a chilly desert wind . The settlement is called Takadom , which means &quot; progress , &quot; and it is one of Egypt ' s tentative assertions of national possession over the vast northern Sinai , an empty desert roamed by invaders since the dawn of history and lost to Israel for 15 years , booty of the last two Arab-Israeli wars . Here , a_few dozen Egyptian families have settled in the one-room houses , fenced sandy lots and five acres of planted fields that the Cairo government is offering all university graduates mortgage-free for five years . Then , each family will have 30 years to pay_off the $ 3 # 283 they owe for the land . For Egypt , it is a way of easing the burden of population in the teeming Nile Valley -- where 96 % of the country ' s 60 million people live_on the fertile land , just 4 % of Egypt ' s territory , that straddles the river . And politically , development of the Sinai asserts , once and for all , Egypt ' s hold_on the strategic peninsula . For Ali Abdel Qadir Ismail , 32 , an agriculture graduate from the Suez Canal city of Ismailia who last year moved to Takadom , in the northern Sinai southwest of Al Arish , it is a way of staking a claim in a future -- for himself and for Egypt . &quot; I worked for a rabbit breeding company in the private sector , making_good money . But this is the future of my family , &quot; he said . &quot; It is enough now that I live_in a kingdom of my own , on land that has been irrigated with the blood of martyrs. &quot; Twelve years after Israel returned the 23 # 622-square-mile Sinai to Egypt with the historic Camp David peace accords , Egypt is taking the most ambitious steps_in its history to finally populate the vast , mountainous desert that is the most important land buffer between Arabs and Jews . Last month , digging began on the second phase of the Salaam ( Peace ) Canal , a $ 1.4-billion project to carry 12.5 million cubic_meters a day of fresh_water from the Nile into the northern Sinai , irrigating 400 # 000 acres of new farmland and opening the way for 3 million or more Egyptians to eventually populate a region that is now , despite 12 years of sporadic development , home to only about 250 # 000 Egyptians . It is the second-largest public works project in Egypt ' s history -- second only to the Aswan_High_Dam on the Nile -- and a crucial part of Egypt ' s plans not only to call the Sinai its own but to capitalize on $ 2.5 billion in investment envisioned as taking_place in the neighboring Gaza Strip and West_Bank when a peace agreement is signed between Palestinians and Israel . Eventually , Sinai development will guarantee Egypt ' s place in the emerging Middle_East market and open a trade and travel corridor -- possible only with a final peace between Arabs and Israel -- that will link Libya on Egypt ' s western border , through the Sinai , to Israel , Jordan , Syria , Turkey and finally Europe . &quot; We are trying to make our plans , taking into consideration the changes that are happening in the area and internationally , &quot; said Hussein Gebaly of Egypt ' s Ministry of Reconstruction . &quot; To the west we have the ( North_American Free_Trade ) Agreement , to the east we have the new tigers of Asia , and we have in our area the new Middle_East market with its dimensions that are imposing change on us. &quot; The Sinai development plan , which has the highest priority in Egypt ' s five-year development projections , envisions new links between Egypt proper and the peninsula , either via a bridge across the Suez Canal or two new tunnels beneath it , an industrial zone straddling the canal at the city of Suez , expanded airports and power_plants , mining development in the Sinai interior and a vast new network of housing , farmland and tourism along the pristine beaches of the Gulf_of_Aqaba . Many Egyptian officials are sure that it was in part the sheer emptiness of the Sinai -- invaded over the centuries by Jews , Romans , Muslims , Crusaders , Mamelukes , French and British forces -- that left the Red_Sea peninsula easy prey for Israeli tanks when they advanced across its deserts in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 . It wasn ' t until 1982 that the last Israeli settlers , in a deal sweetened with cash settlements , packed their belongings and left . The Israeli army was replaced in front-line zones by an 11-nation military monitoring group , the U.S.-led Multinational Force and Observers , which has kept watch on a peace that only recently has seemed ready to deliver prosperity . The town of Taba , on the peninsula ' s eastern coast opposite the Israeli resort town of Eilat , was the last territory handed back , in 1989 . For years , the Sinai foundered under Egyptian control , in part because the Israelis destroyed much of the infrastructure they laid_down during their 15-year occupation . The Israeli settlement town of Yamit , near the northern city of Al Arish , still lies_in bulldozed ruins as it was left by furious Israeli settlers when they were forced_out by the Israeli army . In the early years , Israeli experimental farms near Nuweiba , taken_over by Egyptian Bedouins , fell_into decline , and tourist villages built_in the Israeli era languished along the Sinai coastline . Bedouin fishermen damaged the coral_reefs of the eastern coast by dynamiting their catch , and a massive land grab by both Egyptian and foreign investors for tourist hotel development near the peninsula ' s southern tip at Sharm el Sheik threatened to irreparably befoul the pristine environment of the southern Sinai , with its untouched mountain valleys , clear turquoise waters and colorful underwater marine life . But in recent years , Egypt , under massive pressure from international environmental groups , has set_up a controlled development plan that is maximizing hotel construction along the eastern coast while imposing strict requirements on water desalination , garbage_disposal and sewage treatment systems . The system should guarantee protection of the natural wonders that attract tourist dollars . Now , about 750 square_miles of southern Sinai -- or 52 % of the Aqaba coast -- have been set_aside as part of a national protected area that joins the Ras Muhammad National_Park on the tip of the peninsula . &quot; They were convinced by the economic argument that you needed to protect the resources if you were going_to develop resource-based tourism , and now they ' re very serious about it , &quot; said Michael P . Pearson , project manager for the Ras Muhammad preserve . Growth in southern Sinai has been unprecedented , increasing from 1 # 030 hotel beds in 1988 to 5 # 276 at present . That number is expected to more_than double by 1995 , producing a 1 # 005 % growth_rate over just seven years . Sharm el Sheik , the sun-washed enclave that held barely three hotels and a_few apartment_buildings when the Israelis left in 1982 , is alive today with the sound of bulldozers , hammers and drills . The last remaining seafront along scenic Naama Bay and the surrounding bluffs are being filled_in with hotels and restaurants . Everyone from Israeli hoteliers to actor Omar Sharif to the sons of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have claimed pieces of the action , and land prices have soared . Italian entrepreneurs are backing the most massive project to date , the $ 88-million Sheik Coast development , just north of Sharm el Sheik , which will include a 300-room hotel , apartments , private villas and a huge jetty reaching into the Red_Sea . Hisham Gabr , 33 , an anthropology graduate of the American University of Cairo , was one of the first to capitalize on the building boom , moving from Cairo in 1982 to open the first private diving center in Sharm el Sheik . He reflects upon what it has meant for young Egyptians to come_to the Sinai and , finally , embrace the peace with Israel . &quot; When I decided to come here , I said OK , the reality today is that our generation is dealing with the conflict between Egypt and Israel , &quot; Gabr said . &quot; We do not have any choices to make . We are dealing with the leftovers of whatever our parents and grandparents have done . &quot; According to Egyptian belief , Israelis took Palestine by force . And according to the belief of an Israeli of my generation , he was brought_up in a house where his father lived , so it is home for him . How many of us are willing to go_through , at the end of the 20th Century , the moral and ethical questions of : ' Was my grandfather right to take this place ? And are these debts legitimate today ? Or has so_much time passed that I am no longer responsible . . . . ? ' &quot; I have made the choice willingly to participate in the development of this area . I see that the development of Sinai is definitely a personal statement , and not just a political act . I am a young Egyptian , I ' m fed up with Cairo , from the crowds , from the pollution , and I need a meaning for my life. &quot; The diving center , which Gabr opened when he was 26 with a loan from the National_Bank of Egypt , is now undergoing a $ 3.2-million expansion . Just down the street , Adly Mestekawy , who opened one of the first private Egyptian hotels in southern Sinai , has expanded his holdings to include an experimental farm that is producing oranges , figs , olives and landscape greenery , partially with reclaimed sewage water . &quot; The Israelis left , and there was nothing here . It was for us the Wild_West , and I ' m one of the cowboys who rode in first , &quot; Mestekawy said . &quot; From the first_moment , I said the Israelis have left a mine of gold , and we have only to exploit it . There were no people , no businessmen , nothing -- only Bedouins without the knowledge and the know-how to exploit it. &quot; Further up the coast , toward Dahab , hundreds of Bedouins , who for years roamed the deep valleys and coastal_plains with their flocks , have since the Israeli invasion begun settling in and opening_up shops , traditional tent-style coffeehouses and bamboo crash pads -- often as cheap as $ 1.25 a night -- for the youthful low-budget tourists who find in Sinai a remnant of 1960s California . Tie-dyed T-shirts and hashish are hot sellers on the lazy road that winds along the Dahab coast . The music of Lynard Skynard and Russian choruses filters_out of coffeehouses . But even they find themselves squeezed in by the five-star hotels that are pushing_up on all sides . And the Bedouin entrepreneurs see yet another way_of_life nearing an end . &quot; Business is good , but it ' s not for everybody . And the Bedouins in Dahab , they have land to sell , but so what , after they ' ve sold it , what do they have left ? &quot; asked Embarak Hamid Sobieh , a Bedouin who began his sedentary days as a driver for the Israelis . Since then , he bought land for 30 cents a square_meter , opened a major tourist complex north of Dahab at Shark ' s Bay and often takes the opportunity to deplore the evils of Egyptian bureaucracy that have forced him over the years to obtain licenses and permits to stay in business . Most of the Bedouins are like Sobieh . They miss the ready jobs and free food handouts that came_with the Israelis . &quot; The government asks me , who are all these Israeli tourists who come_to Egypt and say , ' Where is Embarak ? Where is Embarak ? ' &quot; he said , chuckling . &quot; I tell them , ' I ' m a Bedouin . If they come , I eat with them. ' &quot; In blustery northern Sinai , where the Peace Canal is being built , the business focus is partly on tourism but primarily on the coming boom in nearby Gaza , which is scheduled for self-rule under the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks . The Egyptian Sinai towns of Al Arish and Rafah , just outside the Gaza territory , expect that they will host contractors from around the world who will rebuild Gaza , a Palestinian city under Israeli control for decades . &quot; Of course there are big hopes . This nation is right next door ; there is only a barbed wire between us . We are enthusiastic to make that step , &quot; said Said Jomaa Shehata , manager of the North Sinai Chamber_of_Commerce . The Egyptian governor of northern Sinai , Mounir Shash , said the region is expected to grow from 215 # 000 people to more_than 3 million , with an increase of more_than 1 million in the next 20 years . &quot; When Sinai was liberated , we began from zero . There was nothing at all , either from infrastructure or services . Now , let anyone from Israel come and see what happened in the Sinai , and he will have a reply , &quot; he said , pointing to Egypt ' s $ 430-million investment in schools , roads , power_plants , telephones and water facilities . &quot; The water from the Salaam Canal will be the new blood to Sinai to make a new society , &quot; he said . &quot; So it is a new future . Everything will be changed here . With everything beginning from zero , you can create the society you want . There are no restrictions . Everything is possible. &quot; The Peace Canal Egypt ' s $ 1.4 billion project will bring fresh_water from the Nile to the Sinai_peninsula .</TEXT>
