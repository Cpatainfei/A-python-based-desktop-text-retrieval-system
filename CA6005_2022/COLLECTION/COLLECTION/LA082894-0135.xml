   <HEADLINE> RACING WITH DEATH ; FOR THE DRIVERS , PERIL LIES JUST AROUND A CORNER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Speed is their drug , racing provides the rush . The potential peril that lies_around every corner is pushed to the far reaches of the mind , eclipsed by the desire to push the pedal to the floor . Race_car drivers muster all their daring and verve to seek_out The Edge -- that narrow line of propelling a car as fast as it can go without flying off the track . &quot; It ' s the only thing we know . It ' s what we do for a living . It ' s a must , &quot; said NASCAR star Rusty Wallace , his voice unwavering , his conviction firm . On the other hand , that resolve is tested when a member of their fraternity goes_over the edge . Speed is uncaring , unforgiving , indiscriminate . It can kill the best , like Formula One star Ayrton Senna . It can kill those far from the pinnacle of the sport , like stock_car rookie Rodney Orr . &quot; Whenever I wake_up , and I do a lot times in the middle of the night with bad dreams happening , I ' m always totally out of control , &quot; said Mario Andretti , who has seen friends die but survived to_the_point where he ' s only four races away from retirement . &quot; Something happens and there ' s nothing I can do about it . that ' s the part that frightens me more_than anything . Ayrton Senna was the best in the world , but there was nothing he could do about it. &quot; Still , Andretti has no thoughts of cutting_short the final year of his racing career , even with all_the tragedy that has rocked the sport in the last 16 months . &quot; that ' s the nature of the beast , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re trying to tame a demon , if you will . The race_car can be a very lethal weapon . But that ' s all part of the excitement , part of the lure that gets us going . If this thing was a piece_of_cake where anybody could do_it , we would n ' t be interested . We ' d be in accounting or something. &quot; Formula One lost two drivers -- including Senna , its brightest star -- during one terrible weekend in May . Four Winston Cup drivers have died since April 1993 -- including two who perished in aviation accidents while flying to race tracks . And another top star , Ernie Irvan , was seriously injured last weekend in Michigan , his brain damaged , his best hope being a slow , painful recovery . &quot; I told my people , my wife , my team , &quot; NASCAR ' s Geoff Bodine said , &quot; if something happens to me like it did to Ernie , go_on , find somebody else and go_on . &quot; If somebody has a factory and a guy dies of a heart_attack , they don ' t close the factory . If you have a football_team and your quarterback is Joe Montana , and Joe Montana breaks his leg , you go_on and play the game . It ' s not barbaric . It ' s just the way it needs to be . &quot; We love the sport most of the time . Sometimes we hate it . I hated it ( the day Irvan was hurt ) . It ' s a love-hate thing most of the time . But you have to go on. &quot; The Andretti clan understands that . Mario ' s oldest son , Michael , had a close_call Wednesday when his Indy-car slammed into the wall during testing at Nazareth Speedway , sending him to the hospital with a concussion . It was one of those hate days that Bodine spoke about . But soon , they ' ll be back to loving it , just as Mario and another son , Jeff , couldn ' t resist the lure of speed after suffering serious injuries in the 1993 Indianapolis 500 . &quot; It ' s not easy , &quot; said Wallace , who went_on to finish fourth in the Winston Cup race that Bodine won -- just a day after Irvan was critically injured in practice when he cut a tire and veered into a concrete wall at more_than 170 m.p.h. &quot; It was_on my mind the whole time , &quot; Wallace said . &quot; I drove three or four laps thinking_about it . I would come_to turn two and see that mark on the wall where he hit and I would think_about it . I wish on Saturday night they had painted that wall so we didn ' t have to look_at it. &quot; But Wallace never considered not racing . And if history is any indication , Irvan eventually will point his recovery toward one goal : getting_back behind the wheel of the race_car that nearly took his life . Take Neil Bonnett , whose career appeared to be over after a 1990 crash left him with amnesia . He didn ' t race for more_than three years , but never lost hope of returning . He was plotting a comeback this year when he lost_control of his car during a practice_session at Daytona and plowed into the wall . In a matter of seconds , he was killed . &quot; I don ' t even think_about it , &quot; said Wallace , discussing the specter of danger over the roar of the engines in Team Penske ' s North Carolina garage . &quot; I work as hard as I possibly can to take it out of my mind. &quot; Andretti doesn ' t regard racing as being any more dangerous than other sports where speed or contact play an integral role . Athletes die on the football_field , in the boxing ring , on the ski slope . &quot; I ' ll be watching a football game and a guy will land on his head and it ' s like , ' Oh my God , how close did he come_to breaking his neck ? &quot; ' Andretti said . &quot; There ' s no worse injury than that . I think death would be better than that. &quot; Six deaths notwithstanding , Wallace insists the perils of racing have been exaggerated . He has walked away from two horrible crashes , further emboldening his belief that his car -- and himself -- are nearly indestructible . &quot; The danger is nothing like people think it is , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re talking_about a_couple_of accidents happening . I don ' t know how other teams have their cockpits fixed . . . but I know how I do my stuff . I feel confident in the way we do it. &quot; Nonetheless , the Irvan crash prompted everyone -- Wallace included -- to take a second look_at how they were doing things . The Penske car builders already have asked &quot; if there ' s anything they can do to make_it safer , &quot; Wallace said . &quot; They talked_about padding the car more and more so you can take a wild wreck and still walk away. &quot; Irvan ' s crash hasn ' t brought the kind of protests in Winston Cup that followed Senna ' s death in Formula One , where spooked drivers suddenly realized if the best in the world could die , they certainly could , too . Tracks were redesigned to slow speeds . Cars were altered to provide more protection around the driver ' s head . Gerhard Berger , the Austrian who drives for Ferrari on the Formula One circuit , lost one of his closest friends when Senna died . A day earlier , fellow Austrian Roland Ratzenberger was killed while practicing . &quot; I was in the_pit , watching the TV monitor , when Roland went_off , &quot; Berger told Nigel Roebuck of Autosport . &quot; I could see them working_on his heart and I knew the guy was dead . I was completely shocked and when I got_to the motor_home I was shaking . &quot; That was the moment when I said , &quot; Think_about this . You ' ve had some success , and you ' ve made_good money out of it . For the rest of your life , you can have a smaller risk of hurting yourself . Maybe now is the time to stop. ' &quot; For 10 minutes , I sat there and then I concluded , no , I still love to drive racing_cars , even if there is a risk. &quot; Max Mosley , president of the International Automobile Federation that sanctions F-1 , would have expected nothing less . &quot; If you said to a racing driver , ' There in front of you are two cars . One of them is very dangerous , one of them is very safe , but the dangerous one is 5 seconds lap quicker than the safe one , they would all without exception get_into the dangerous one , &quot; Mosley said . &quot; You cannot expect racing drivers to be primarily interested in safety . That is the job of the people who run the races. &quot; &quot; Unfortunately , &quot; Andretti said , &quot; we don ' t react fast enough . We usually react after the fact . that ' s always been one of my complaints as far as doing certain things in racing . Why do you do_it now ? Why didn ' t you do_it before ? &quot; Andretti continues to push oval tracks to install &quot; energy-absorbing walls &quot; -- the kind of walls that may have lessened Irvan ' s injuries , or kept Bonnett and Orr alive when they crashed three days apart while practicing for the Daytona 500 . &quot; I think it ' s going_to come , &quot; Andretti said , &quot; but it ' s not going_to come soon enough . we ' ll just have to suffer through it. &quot; While the Senna crash is still under investigation , the book already has been closed on Irvan ' s wreck . NASCAR took one day to rule that Irvan ' s car apparently ran_over something on the track that punctured the right front tire . At least the other drivers know what happened to Irvan . The cause of both the Bonnett and Orr wrecks is still listed as &quot; inconclusive , &quot; said NASCAR spokesman Kevin Triplett , who defended the organization ' s investigative procedures in the wake of a newspaper report that found only one fatal crash out of eight in the past two decades had been thoroughly probed . &quot; There ' s a_thousand elements involved in any crash , &quot; Triplett said . &quot; Every human reacts differently , so you ' ve got another thousand elements involved . It ' s just impossible to reconstruct what occurred first and in what order. &quot; Wallace seems fully satisfied with NASCAR ' s process for investigating wrecks . He believes the major problem in Winston Cup is the re-emergence of Hoosier Tires on a circuit that once was the exclusive domain of Goodyear . Competition between the two companies , he fears , can only lead to faster -- and less reliable -- tires . &quot; I think the tire war sucks , &quot; he said . &quot; The drivers would not have to worry about being outrun by faster tires if we all had equal tires . . . . The competition should come_down to having a little stronger engines , building your body a little better than the next guy . Instead , we ' ve got_to compete with the compounds on the other tires . The cars have gotten so quick it ' s unbelievable , but to be in the sport you have to do it. &quot; Wallace is still bitter about the death of Bonnett , who took his final ride_on two pairs of Hoosiers . &quot; That will never leave my mind , &quot; he said . &quot; Deep in my heart , I think the tire thing had a lot to do with that . If there hadn ' t been a tire war , that would n ' t have happened. &quot; Hoosier insists its tire is safe . Besides , Irvan was_on Goodyears when he crashed , although there was no evidence that the tire failed . There also was no evidence that Bonnett died because he was using Hoosiers . In the end , the drivers continue to test the limits of speed . And some will die -- no matter how many steps are taken_to make the sport safer . &quot; This may sound cold , but I always say it ' s like going_to work and seeing a neighbor in a car accident , &quot; Andretti said . &quot; It doesn ' t mean you ' re going to walk to work the next day . You keep going and hope it doesn ' t happen to you. &quot;</TEXT>
