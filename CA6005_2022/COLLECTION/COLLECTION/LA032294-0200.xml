   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; NEW ON-LINE SERVICE TARGETS TINSELTOWN ; TECHNOLOGY : POST-PRODUCTION FIRMS COULD TRANSMIT VIDEO ON THE COMPUTER_NETWORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sprint and Silicon Graphics Inc. plan to announce today the launch of a private telephone and computer_network aimed at the entertainment_industry that will allow subscribers to transmit video or graphics to another site in a matter of minutes . Several post-production firms that do visual effects work for film , television and advertising that require dozens of time consuming back-and-forth approval and editing sessions have already signed_up for the network , dubbed &quot; Drums &quot; -- a reference_to one of the first forms of mass communication . And two of the major film studios are considering joining up . Coming a day after Pacific Bell ' s announcement Monday of a planned test to deliver movies to theaters over telephone_lines , the prospect of a Sprint-SGI &quot; post-production internet &quot; that could speed decision-making and ultimately save costs reflects how dramatically advancing telecommunications are starting to reshape the way the entertainment_industry does business . While the production process itself has become ever-more digital -- witness the &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; computer-generated dinosaurs and the growing trend of digitally inserting actors into their sets -- communication between the numerous people and businesses that contribute to a film has remained largely in the age of the Pony_Express . &quot; It blows me away that people have this tremendous power on the desktop , do a bunch of work , and then download it to commercial tape and mail the tape through the U.S. mail , &quot; says Jim Flaging , regional director for Sprint ' s business services group . * Not everybody is eager to embrace as-yet-unproven new technologies . The reaction Monday of theater owners , studio executives and Hollywood ' s creative community to PacBell ' s &quot; cinema of the future &quot; announcement was decidedly mixed . &quot; Film distributors would be delighted to see an electronic method of distribution that would eliminate the need for physical distribution , &quot; said one studio executive . &quot; But one of our concerns is quality , and another is who pays_for it , the theater owner or a distributor ? &quot; Larry Jacobson of the AMC theater chain was more bullish on the subject : &quot; Change is change , and people are afraid of it . You can close your eyes and put your head in the sand if you want , but it ' s the future of the business. &quot; Sean Daniel , a producer at Universal Studios , said he ' d be interested in it if the technology was good_enough . But he took some offense at the suggestion that the digital format could lead to producing different endings for different audiences , or re-editing a film after it ' s already been released . &quot; Anything that makes the business more profitable would be good for movies . But I think it is a misunderstanding about what a motion_picture is there to do . Theater 12 might have a choose-your-own-alien attack . But that ' s not a movie . A movie is someone else ' s vision that you want to give yourself over to see. &quot;</TEXT>
