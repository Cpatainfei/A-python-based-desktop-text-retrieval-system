   <HEADLINE> N . IRELAND ' S PEACE REQUIRES ECONOMIC RETOOLING ; PLANNING : IT WILL TAKE A FINE BALANCE TO DISMANTLE SECTORS THAT THRIVED ON ' THE TROUBLES ' OF THE PAST 25 YEARS WHILE ATTRACTING INVESTMENT AND TOURISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Near a tall wall , called the &quot; peace line &quot; because it was built to keep Catholic and Protestant neighbors from fighting , sits a factory that epitomizes Northern_Ireland ' s problems and recent changes . Most of the 400 workers at Mackie International ' s textile machinery plant are Protestant , although it is_on the Catholic side of the fence . Protestants go_through a separate factory gate from their Catholic co-workers , but they work together on the shop_floor . &quot; We have Catholic dogs and Protestant dogs ; we have Catholic cats and Protestant cats , &quot; says Mackie ' s chief_executive , Patrick Dougan . He hopes these attitudes change . As Northern_Ireland lives through the early days of peace declared by paramilitary forces on both sides of the dispute over British rule , Dougan is one businessman who says reinvigorating the sickly economy is crucial to ending the violence for good . But it will take a fine balance to dismantle portions of the economy that thrived on &quot; the troubles &quot; of the past 25 years while attracting investment and tourism . * One problem is Northern_Ireland ' s disproportionate number of state employees , notably police . About one in three workers are in the public sector , while just one in six is employed in manufacturing . With peace , Northern_Ireland might trim a well-paid , 20 # 000-member security_force made_up of police_officers , prison officials and locally recruited British soldiers known as the Royal Irish Regiment . About 14 # 000 of those jobs can be expected to vanish within five years , with fallout eliminating 6 # 000 more jobs , according to Graham Gudgin , director of the Northern_Ireland Economic Research_Center . Even jobs in private industry would be lost . Likely economic victims of peace would be companies that repair bombed-out windows , or dealers who sell security devices that people have used to keep gunmen from crashing in at night . But Gudgin believes tourism could double_over the next five years , adding 10 # 000 jobs . &quot; We ' re now in the realm of speculation , but we might gain another 2 # 000 jobs a year through inward investment , &quot; Gudgin said . &quot; In about five years , we might break_even . The problem is , the people losing jobs won ' t be the ones getting jobs. &quot; If job loss outpaces job creation , the fragile economy could weaken further . * The troubles have been economically as well as socially and politically painful . The Confederation of British Industry says up_to 40 # 000 jobs were lost as the violence escalated in the early 1970s , compounding problems from a general deterioration of heavy industry . Inward investment slowed dramatically , although some companies moved_in . Before the cease-fires , Hilton said it would put a hotel in a downtown development , giving Northern_Ireland ' s business_community a psychological lift . And Belfast ' s Europa Hotel , bombed about 30 times since the early 1970s , has undergone a dramatic refurbishment to bring itself up_to international four-star standards . British Prime_Minister John Major chose a Northern_Ireland executives lunch at the Europa to announce Oct . 21 he would assume the_Irish Republican Army ' s truce was intended to be permanent . This ended weeks of British government insistence that the Catholic-based paramilitary group spell_out its intentions more specifically . Major was saying peace will help the economy . But business_leaders are leery of being too optimistic , knowing that many international investors never even think_of Northern_Ireland as a plant location . &quot; They say , ' You ' re like Beirut , ' &quot; said Stan Mallon , an executive_director at the Industrial Development Board . &quot; A businessman doesn ' t want to invest in a country plagued with violence . We say that perception is not correct. &quot; At first glance , visitors might have their doubts . Armored military_vehicles patrol the streets , as do soldiers toting submachine_guns . Moving from one Catholic area to a neighboring Protestant district , a metal barricade blocks traffic so soldiers can punch each license_plate number into a central computer . Assuming the car is not stolen or owned by certain paramilitary figures , the barricade is electronically moved_out of the way . Just as Mackie ' s factory has a Catholic gate and a Protestant gate , some parts of town have segregated taxi services that ferry people only from their own areas to &quot; neutral &quot; turf . The threat of sectarian assassination has underpinned work for many of the more_than 100 taxi firms in Belfast alone . Unemployment remains chronic in Northern_Ireland , where 12.8 % of the work_force has no job . The British average is 9.1 % . Catholic men remain about 2 1 / 2 times as likely as Protestant men to be unemployed . Discrimination by Protestant employers was a main root of the troubles when Catholics campaigned for civil_rights in the late 1960s . The imbalance is eroding , in part because the collapse of traditional industries dominated by Protestants has pushed_up unemployment in that community . But at some factories , a &quot; chill factor &quot; in the form of harassment and threats deters Catholics . At Mackie , once a bastion of Northern_Ireland Protestantism , Dougan hopes to exemplify a better way . A Catholic who left Northern_Ireland in his youth for fear of job discrimination , Dougan began a successful career in the auto industry of the_British Midlands . He took_control of Mackie in 1991 by assuming debts of its bankrupt owners . Since then , the proportion of Catholics at Mackie has risen from 11 % to 30 % . This shows the two sides can set_aside their differences and work together , Dougan says . It remains to be seen whether investors agree .</TEXT>
