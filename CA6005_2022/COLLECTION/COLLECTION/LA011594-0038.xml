   <TEXT> The very title of Peter Arnett ' s CNN report -- &quot; Terror Nation ? U.S. Creation ? &quot; ( at 6 p.m. Sunday ) -- suggests the Frankenstein syndrome that seems to dog so many of the political monsters created during the Cold_War . Of course , one person ' s monster is another person ' s freedom fighter : Arnett ' s particular monster here is militant Islamic leader and Afghanistan Prime_Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , who may be viewed_as the loosest of loose cannons , arming and training terrorists for assaults on the West and Western allies.His Muslim brothers , though , posit him as a hero . It is this devotion , and the suicidal martyrdom that results from it , that makes Hekmatyar ' s alleged brand of terror so potentially dangerous . The first salvo in this war : the bombing of the World Trade Center . Arnett , hardly_a favorite of the U.S. defense Establishment since his spectacular Baghdad reports during the height of the Gulf War , will make no new friends with &quot; Terror Nation ? , &quot; which convincingly explains how the Trade Center bombers received their initial training , under CIA sponsorship , during the war to free Afghanistan of the invading Soviet army . Arnett is remarkably free to explore Hekmatyar ' s network of Afghanistan terrorist training camps -- he even arranges a talk with Hekmatyar himself . With cash derived from a resurgent drug trade through the Khyber Pass , and a huge U.S. and Soviet arms supply left_behind by the war , Hekmatyar , Arnett reports , has been able to wage a two-pronged battle . First , he is embroiled in a civil_war to oust Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani . Second , with his control of between 5 # 000 and 10 # 000 militants , Hekmatyar has been able to extend his fundamentalist jihad ( or holy war ) into India ' s Kashmir province , Egypt , Algeria and the Islamic-dominated southern provinces of the former Soviet_Union .
