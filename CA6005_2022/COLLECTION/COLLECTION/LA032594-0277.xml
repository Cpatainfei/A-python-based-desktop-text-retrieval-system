   <HEADLINE> DISNEY TIGHTENS RETIREE HEALTH_CARE RULES ; BENEFITS : EMPLOYEES MUST STAY TO AGE 55 TO QUALIFY , NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS ON JOB . MANY WILL QUIT BEFORE JULY 1 DEADLINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Walt Disney Co. , reeling from continued losses at Euro Disneyland , is tightening eligibility requirements for retirement health_care benefits among its 70 # 000 employees worldwide . The new Disney policy requires workers to stay with the company until they are at least 55 years old to receive the post-retirement health benefits . that ' s in addition to the previous requirement that employees work a minimum of 30 # 000 hours over 20 years . Before , retirees received the benefits regardless of their age at resignation . Eligible , hourly employees younger than 55 have until July 1 to leave the company or be subject_to the new rules , which took_effect March 1 . Some workers suggest that Disney ' s primary motivation is to gain additional savings as higher-paid , veteran employees resign to preserve their current benefits . &quot; What upsets me so_much is that I ' m not ready to leave . But I ' m being forced to , &quot; said a 39-year-old Disney supervisor who spoke on condition of anonymity . &quot; That kind of upsets me , but I have no other option . It ' s their way of cleaning everything out. &quot; Disney spokesman John Dreyer denied any attempt to entice veteran workers to leave the company . He said the grace period was &quot; made_out of fairness to long-term employees to give them an option &quot; -- retire , or fall_under the new rules . Dreyer would not reveal how much money Disney expects to save by cutting retirement_benefits , but he said it is substantial . &quot; It ' s more in_line with corporate America , but it remains a good plan , &quot; he said of the revised benefits . Saving Disney even more money , the new rules also will postpone health benefits for retirees by three years until age 65 , when they would also be eligible for Medicare . The health benefit changes are the latest cost-cutting moves at Burbank-based Disney , which is still reeling from losses at Euro Disney resort . Disney ' s half-ownership of the troubled French attraction cut $ 514 million off its bottom_line last fiscal_year . Euro Disney is undergoing a financial restructuring and the effects are reverberating throughout the company . The entertainment giant recently reversed a longstanding policy against releasing its cinematic crown_jewel , the 1937 animated classic &quot; ' Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , &quot; to the videocassette market . Though possibly dampening future box_office returns , the move should generate tens of millions of dollars in new revenue . In light of Euro Disney losses , Disney is widely believed to be re-evaluating whether to proceed with its planned $ 3-billion Disneyland Resort project , which would add a new Westcot theme park and several hotels to Disneyland in Anaheim . In the theme park division -- the company ' s largest and most profitable sector -- Disney recently took the uncommon move of dismissing 60 middle managers at Disneyland in Anaheim and 300 at the Walt Disney Resort in Orlando , Fla . Disneyland workers said in a recent company poll that they believe penny-pinching has reduced the quality of the park for visitors . The new retirement health rule strikes particularly hard at the 45 # 000 workers in Disney ' s theme park division , because so many started in high_school or college , climbed through the ranks to middle management and are still more_than a decade from age 55 . &quot; They have been pushing people out the door for a while , &quot; said one janitor with more_than 20 years of experience . Workers were informed of the changes in February letters from Executive_Vice_President Sanford M . Litvack . He cited &quot; rising health_care costs and President Clinton ' s health_care proposals &quot; as reasons for the change . But the path was cleared at Disneyland -- Orange County ' s largest employer with a peak work_force of 12 # 000 workers during the summer -- in_labor negotiations two years ago . Then , says another veteran janitor who is a union_shop steward , the park ' s four major unions threw down a gauntlet when the company insisted on the option to reduce retirement health benefits : make them apply to management as well . &quot; When the salaried personnel found_out ( about the proposed contract cuts ) , all hell broke_loose . They were flabbergasted , &quot; said the steward , who declined to be identified . &quot; They could not believe the company would turn_around and agree to such a clause in the contract . . . . That caused a stink all_the way to Burbank. &quot; The supervisor who intends to quit said the cutbacks are just another example of how Disney , and Disneyland , have changed . &quot; They have whittled_away the perks that made_it special , &quot; she said . No longer do employees receive green-tinted carnations to wear_on St . Patrick ' s Day , or red ones for Mother ' s Day . But , hesitating for a moment , she said pensively : &quot; Little by little , I have noticed all those little things. &quot; How Old , New Plans Compare Walt Disney Co . has made_it harder for its workers to become eligible for company-provided health_care when they retire . Hourly employees with at least 20 years of service have until July 1 to decide whether to quit in_order to qualify under the old rules . OLD PLAN * Benefits provided to workers who complete 20 years of service and 30 # 000 credited hours on_the_job * Coverage begins upon retirement at age 62 NEW PLAN * Benefits provided to workers who complete 20 years of service and 30 # 000 credited hours on_the_job and work for the company until at least age 55 * Coverage begins upon retirement at age 65 WHO MIGHT BE AFFECTED AT DISNEYLAND * More_than a third of the Disneyland work_force , 37.8 % , are_full time . The rest are part time or temporary . * Full-time employees have a median age of 36 , higher than the overall park median age of 24 . The work_force is equally divided between men and women . * Four in 10 Disneyland employees are the primary wage_earners in their households . * Full-time employees stay with Disneyland for an average of seven years . The median for the whole park is three years . Source : Walt Disney Co. ; Researched by CHRIS WOODYARD / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
