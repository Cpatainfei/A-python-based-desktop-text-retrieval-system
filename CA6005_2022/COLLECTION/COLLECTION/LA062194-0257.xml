   <HEADLINE> FIGHT AGAINST ULSTER TERROR ON TRACK DESPITE SETBACK ; NORTHERN_IRELAND : THE DEATHS OF 25 OFFICERS IN A HELICOPTER CRASH HAD RAISED FEARS FOR BRITISH SECURITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Britain ' s campaign against terrorism in Northern_Ireland suffered an enormous setback early this month when 25 senior officers in the security establishment were killed in a helicopter crash in Scotland . The officers , along with four crew_members , died en route from Belfast to Inverness for a top-secret security conference and a major review of the efforts to end violence perpetrated by members of the separatist Irish_Republican_Army . In an instant , the anti-terrorism forces lost senior officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary , which is Northern_Ireland ' s police_force ; of the government ' s police intelligence arm , called the Special Branch ; of the internal security agency known as MI-5 , and of the intelligence division of the_British army . At first , Northern_Ireland security experts suggested the officers were irreplaceable and that the government ' s war against the IRA and Unionist paramilitary forces would be severely hampered . In effect , it was suggested , the &quot; high_command &quot; in the war against terrorism in Northern_Ireland had been wiped_out . But nearly three weeks later , Northern_Ireland officials say , the dead officers have been replaced and the campaign against the IRA and other illegal organizations in the province of Ulster has resumed unabated . Authorities have established that the June 2 crash of the Boeing-built Chinook helicopter was not caused by sabotage -- though whether it was_due to pilot error in bad_weather or to mechanical failure has not been determined . &quot; Obviously , we have experienced a deep sense of loss , &quot; said one official in Britain ' s Northern_Ireland Office . &quot; And it has left huge gaps . But our security structure is something like the army ' s . There are other officers ready to step_up and fill those vacant posts. &quot; Further , officials say that most of the information carried by those killed in the crash is contained in the computerized files of the Northern_Ireland Office , the police and the army . &quot; It is not as if these senior officers carried secrets to the grave with them , &quot; said an official in Belfast . &quot; For years , the security policy here has been for the left_hand to let the right_hand know what it is doing. &quot; But the unexplained decision to place 25 senior officers aboard a single helicopter for a long flight , over water , from Belfast to Inverness has been strongly criticized . &quot; That decision has damaged morale , &quot; one Belfast-based diplomat said . &quot; You wonder how anyone could have made such a stupid decision . And these , after all , were the cream of the . . . intelligence establishment. &quot; The security machine in Northern_Ireland is enormous . The Royal Ulster Constabulary has about 12 # 000 members , the_British army another 12 # 000 ; there are 6 # 000 members of the local army militia and 3 # 500 in the prison service . Northern_Ireland experts point_out that while the loss of senior officers was grievous , those officials would not have had day-to-day involvement with informers -- a practice that lies at the heart of the anti-terrorism operation . &quot; One or two of them might have been the contact for a top-level informer , &quot; said one Ulster specialist . &quot; But by and large , such contacts are handled by lower-level officers. &quot; The breadth of the Northern_Ireland operation was explained last week when MI-5 head Stella Rimington revealed on television that her agency now devotes three-quarters of its efforts to counterterrorism activities , and nearly half to Irish terrorism . MI-5 , also known as the Security Service , is a cross between the FBI and the counterintelligence arm of the CIA . Like the CIA , it has no powers of arrest . &quot; Over the past 18 months , &quot; Rimington said , &quot; more_than 20 Irish republican terrorists have been arrested in Great Britain and charged . &quot; In Northern_Ireland , the security_forces prevent four out of five terrorist attacks which are attempted , &quot; she added .</TEXT>
