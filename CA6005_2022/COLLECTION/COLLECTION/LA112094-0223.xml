   <HEADLINE> ART ; LABORING UNDER NO ILLUSIONS ; PRATAPADITYA PAL HAS BUILT ONE OF THIS COUNTRY ' S PREEMINENT COLLECTIONS OF INDIAN AND SOUTHEAST ASIAN ARTWORKS AT LACMA . DO WE APPRECIATE HIM ? WELL , HE ' S PRETTY REALISTIC ABOUT POPULAR ACCLAIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two Ph.D.s. Twenty-two major museum exhibitions . Two hundred fifty-seven publications . Nineteen editorships . Six professional appointments . Eight university teaching positions . Twenty fellowships and awards . Too many lectures to count . Pratapaditya Pal ' s resume reads like a committee ' s lifetime work , but the credits all belong_to one man , the senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . What ' s more , Pal ' s curriculum vitae doesn ' t even mention his most visible legacy : a collection that he built from a handful of items to about 4 # 000 pieces , giving LACMA one of the nation ' s preeminent holdings of Indian and Southeast Asian art . &quot; It really is quite staggering to see what we have done , &quot; Pal says . &quot; If you gave me $ 30 million or $ 40 million to put this collection together today , I couldn ' t do it. &quot; Casting his net wider to emphasize this unheralded aspect of Southern California ' s cultural wealth , Pal says : &quot; If we put our collection and the Norton Simon collection -- which I also helped to build -- together with the Edward Binney collections of paintings at the San Diego Museum of Art and at our museum , without question this would be absolutely the No . 1 place in America for the No . 1 collection of art from India , Southeast_Asia , Nepal and Tibet. &quot; Having played a lead role in amassing these riches is enormously satisfying , the 59-year-old curator says . &quot; But whether the city knows about it or not , and whether they appreciate it or not is another matter , &quot; he says . &quot; One day maybe they will , 100 years after I ' m gone , which is OK . It ' s all_right . You can ' t expect instant rewards. &quot; Within museum circles , however , Pal is no secret treasure . Earl A . ( Rusty ) Powell III , who directed LACMA for 12 years before taking_over the helm at the National Gallery of Art in Washington , praises Pal ' s intellect and talent : &quot; He ' s very gifted , he ' s a great scholar , and he has worked with donors to build the premier collection of its kind in the country . His is a rarefied field , and he ' s at the top of it. &quot; Approaching his 25th year at LACMA and having recently organized the museum ' s critically acclaimed exhibition &quot; The Peaceful Liberators : Jain Art From India &quot; ( which runs_through Jan . 22 ) , Pal is in the limelight . And he is delighted that the art of a little-known religious sect -- whose pacifist devotees believe that every living creature has an immortal soul -- is getting so_much attention . &quot; I am putting Jain art on the map , &quot; he says . &quot; No major exhibition of Jain art has ever been done , even in India . . . . This is the first and only major attempt at representing one of the great artistic traditions -- under the umbrella of Indian art ' s aesthetic tradition of course , but through the eyes of the Jains. &quot; * Taking a break from welcoming out-of-town visitors and fielding inquiries about the show , Pal has agreed to an interview . Seated at a long table that serves as his desk in a loft behind the museum ' s Indian art_galleries , he reflects on his career with a mixture of contentment and regret . Pal is unabashedly proud_of LACMA ' s collection and his scholarly accomplishments -- preserved in voluminous writings that put his less industrious colleagues to shame -- but far too truthful and art-world weary to pretend that all his ambitions and dreams have been fulfilled . As a senior curator in an institution he loves , he is grateful for the opportunities that have come his way and for friends who have faithfully supported his collecting efforts . But it isn ' t easy being a curator of Indian art in a country that has little interest in the subject , let alone in a city whose collectors favor contemporary art . Neither has it been pleasant to watch his department ' s acquisitions budget diminish -- from a high of $ 545 # 251 in 1981 to a low of $ 28 # 000 in 1993 -- as the museum threw its resources into expanded facilities during the 1980s , then tightened its belt to deal with an economic crunch in the early 1990s . Yet another sore point is multiculturalism , which he says is the subject of too_much talk and too_little action , not only at LACMA but throughout the museum community . This is vintage Pal -- or Pratap , as friends call him . Gracious and witty but brutally frank , he is LACMA ' s eminence grise , resident critic and perpetual outsider . Pal , born in Bangladesh and educated in India and England , has thrived professionally as a Los Angeles County civil_service employee , but he does not suffer the bureaucratic system gladly . &quot; I don ' t believe_in wasting_time , &quot; he says , when asked how he has published so_much without the benefit of sabbaticals . The story of his career begins in 1957 at the University of Calcutta , where he was working_on a master of arts degree in ancient Indian history and culture . &quot; I really wanted to specialize in anthropology , &quot; Pal says . &quot; But that year they did not offer an anthropology course , so I had no alternative but to take fine_arts . I did extremely well . I topped the list at the university , so I was given a scholarship to go_for a Ph.D. &quot; He earned his first doctorate in 1962 in the history of architecture in Nepal , then won a scholarship to Cambridge_University , where he was granted a second doctorate , in Nepalese sculpture and painting , in 1965 . &quot; I really wanted to go_back to India and teach in a university , &quot; he says , &quot; but I couldn ' t get a job . Not because there weren ' t jobs . There were dozens of university jobs . The problem was the Indian system . Things were slow . No one cared about looking_at applications . Things just didn ' t move . Also some people may have felt threatened because I had two Ph.D.s. I may have been overqualified . Whatever it was , I didn ' t get a job. &quot; Meanwhile , the_British Museum in London , the University of Utrecht in the_Netherlands and the Museum of Fine_Arts in Boston all made offers . Pal opted for Boston , which appointed him keeper of the Indian Collection . The title had been created for an illustrious predecessor , Ceylonese art_historian Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy , who died in 1947 . It was a prestigious opportunity for a young scholar , but Pal thought_of it as temporary until he found employment in India . &quot; But this is one of the tragedies of India , &quot; he says . &quot; It is not very kind to its expatriates , who -- even if they want to go_back -- are treated with apathy , if not hostility . I didn ' t leave of my own doing . I was a forced brain_drain , you might say. &quot; While working in Boston in 1969 , Pal consulted with the Los Angeles County Museum on its first important acquisition of Indian art , 235 works from the Nasli and Alice Heeramaneck collection . The next year , Pal accepted LACMA Director Kenneth Donahue ' s offer to head the museum ' s newly created department of Indian and Islamic art . ( Pal became acting director in 1979-80 , after Donahue ' s retirement , and senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art in 1981 , after the formation of a separate department of Islamic art. ) &quot; Apart from the Heeramaneck collection , the museum had nothing in Indian art -- maybe half_a_dozen or a dozen objects , of which two or three were interesting , &quot; Pal says . And indeed , some of his colleagues questioned his judgment , if not his sanity . Sherman Lee , the eminent director of the Cleveland Art Museum and an Asian art specialist , &quot; reprimanded me and said it was a mistake , that I was taking a demotion , &quot; Pal recalls . &quot; But to me it made no difference whether I stayed in Boston or Los Angeles . They are both in America anyway . &quot; Also , I felt the Boston collection had been built by Coomaraswamy , and it was really not going_to go anywhere in terms of support . . . so I felt it would be more exciting to work with a new collection . And Kenneth Donahue was very dedicated in terms of his desires to build_up the Asian collection . The Heeramaneck collection was his purchase , so I knew that I would get whatever support I could. &quot; The late Franklin D . Murphy , a longtime museum trustee and Times Mirror director , also impressed Pal with a promise to find funds for an Indian art library requested by the young Indian curator . &quot; He asked me how much it would cost , &quot; Pal recalls . &quot; I said $ 50 # 000 , which was just a guess . And he said , ' Fine . On the day you join us , I will send you a check for $ 25 # 000 , and when you have spent it I will send you another check. ' Well , that was it . That decided me . Any institution that could make decisions that quickly seemed like a good place to be. &quot; Although Pal came_to Los Angeles with no idea of what he was getting_into , he had enormous support in the 1970s . His major patron was longtime LACMA trustee Anna Bing Arnold , whose gifts helped fill_in gaps in the Heeramaneck collection and acquire major pieces of sculpture . Back then , the museum paid big prices , say $ 300 # 000 or $ 400 # 000 , for special pieces . In addition , Joan Palevsky bought the Heeramanecks ' collection of Islamic art for the museum , and the Ahmanson Foundation helped to fund an additional purchase of West Asian art from the same collection . One thrill for Pal was working with Norton Simon , who sought Pal ' s help in the mid- ' 70s when Simon began collecting Asian art for his museum in Pasadena . &quot; It was exciting to help Mr. Simon , &quot; Pal says . &quot; But -- although I didn ' t realize it at the time -- he made_it increasingly difficult for ( LACMA ) to buy . He was such a potent force and such a sudden force in the market that I think . . . he was the most important influence in upping the price of Indian art. &quot; In these days of tightened budgets , many curators across the country are required to raise their own acquisitions funds and court donors more actively than ever . &quot; Every curator in every department has the same problem , &quot; Pal says . &quot; You find an object and then you try to identify who can be seduced by it . . . . I would say that has been the greatest stress in my 24 years. &quot; Today he counts_on personal friends such_as New York collector Paul F . Walter to donate artworks and on LACMA patrons Harry and Yvonne Lenart to provide cash for acquisitions . Winning appreciation for Indian art has been difficult , Pal says . &quot; Ten years ago , I would have probably felt bad about it , &quot; he says , &quot; But now when I think_of the narrow parameters within which Los Angeles collectors collect , I don ' t feel as bad , because there are hardly any collectors of Old_Masters here either or of great classical works or African or Asian art. &quot; It will take another two generations to nurture private collectors of Indian art in Los Angeles ' Indian community , Pal believes . While he pointed_out that &quot; Jain Art From India &quot; lists Indians among its supporters , he believes that the future of general art museums such_as LACMA is not a matter of persuading ethnic_groups to value their own cultural heritages . He would rather see widespread community support for museums , libraries and other cultural institutions . And museums should do their part by pointing_out intercultural relationships , Pal contends , as he did_in &quot; Light of Asia , &quot; a 1984 exhibition of art from India , Nepal , Tibet , China , Japan , Korea and Southeast_Asia . &quot; We sit around the table and yak about multiculturalism but we do not do intercultural shows , &quot; he says . &quot; We build national boundaries , so we are really contributing to fragmenting the world . In a sense , we are ourselves responsible_for the Saddam Husseins and the Bosnian crisis and all that . If we are going_to try and say that this is one world , that we have the same challenges , the same vision , the same dreams , what better way than to do_it with art ? &quot; * &quot; The Peaceful Liberators : Jain Art From India , &quot; Los Angeles County Museum of Art , 5905 Wilshire Blvd .
