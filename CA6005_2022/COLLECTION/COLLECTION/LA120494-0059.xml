   <HEADLINE> COMMERCE , CULTURE JOIN ON ST . LAWRENCE RIVER ; CANADA : THE MANY MOODS OF LA MER ARE FOUND ON A TRIP FROM THE THOUSAND ISLANDS TO THE SEA . THIS TURNPIKE FOR SHIPPING IS ALSO A REFUGE FOR WILDFOWL , WHALES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The icebreaker Pierre Radisson , flagship of the Canadian coast guard ' s St . Lawrence River fleet , tosses aside chunks of ice the size of cottages . Snow , sky and shoreline blur . Filing along behind us in a wintry convoy are the Federal Kumano , a bulk carrier from Manila , a tramp_steamer flying a Panamanian flag , a Hong Kong container_ship and a Canadian tanker . The St . Lawrence is a big-shouldered river that can challenge a navigator any time of the year . I would discover this when I returned in summer and chartered a 37-foot cutter to follow the river ' s 750-mile course to the sea . I would find a river of many moods , often sophisticated , occasionally wild and stormy , but never less than majestic . Short as major rivers go , the St . Lawrence makes_up for it in volume ; its flow is nearly that of the Rhine , Volga and Nile combined . Its narrowest pinch , under the Quebec_City bridge , measures half a mile ; crossing the river ' s mouth is a voyage of 90 miles . There locals refer to it as la mer , the sea . The river spills from the eastern edge of Lake_Ontario , then snakes northeastward , sketching the frontier between New York state and Canada ' s Ontario province . By the time it reaches Montreal , it has dropped 226 feet through the complex of weirs and locks of the St . Lawrence Seaway . As part of the Great Lakes St . Lawrence Seaway system , the river provides access as far inland as Duluth , Minn . Each year , ships make about 2 # 300 trips along the river section alone . I began my summer journey in the Thousand Islands -- actually there are about 1 # 800 of them -- which make a patchwork of the river as it leaves Lake_Ontario . The islands , some hardly more_than large rocks , hold farms , estates and summer cottages that can cost millions of dollars . On tiny Heart Island , for instance , broods a 120-room castle guarded by gates and turrets . It was built at the turn_of_the_century by George Boldt , wealthy manager of New York ' s Waldorf Astoria Hotel . Today it is a tourist attraction . Entering Quebec Province , the St . Lawrence becomes the Fleuve St.-Laurent , for this is the heart of French-speaking Canada . Guiding my cutter Foxtrot through the final locks of the seaway , I followed the strong currents under arching bridges , noisy with trains and traffic pouring into workaday Montreal . Always long on originality , Montreal ' s more whimsical attractions include the annual boat_race organized by sailing instructor Yves Plante . &quot; The rules limit you to $ 100 ( about $ 75 in the United States ) for materials . You have three hours to build your boat , &quot; Plante explained , &quot; then into the water , and the race begins. &quot; Early Sunday morning , 42 skippers and their crews arrived_at the Olympic Basin on Ile Notre-Dame to unload plywood , plastic sheets , cardboard , old barrels and rope . During the busiest three hours I can remember , my crew and I cobbled_together a dinghy of rough plywood and rigged it with a spritsail cut from a $ 6 tarp . Before a faint breeze , I coaxed our dinghy to the finish_line , but well behind the winner , carpenter Alain Guibert ' s long , narrow outrigger . Heavy industry defines much of the upper St . Lawrence . Effluent from scores of paper_mills , chemical plants , smelters and refineries has stained its sparkling_waters for decades , choking local fish populations and even poisoning the endangered beluga whales hundreds of miles downstream . Federal and provincial environment ministries began a major effort to clean_up the river in 1988 , targeting the 50 worst industrial polluters . The program has already cut their toxic dumping by nearly 75 % . Yet many environmentalists are not satisfied , claiming that more needs to be done to restore the river to health . Purging the muddy river_bottom of heavy metals , they say , will take generations . Sailing toward Quebec_City , Foxtrot danced along the wide river . Next day , docked in the city , I drove to Cap Charles to seek_out the home of Delphis Duhamel , now retired from the furniture industry . &quot; I started this hobby of saluting passing ships in 1964 , partly to spark our children ' s interest in geography , &quot; Duhamel said when he showed me the breathtaking panorama from his front_yard . In lockers around us hung flags of all nations . A weatherproof console protected his tape_player and cassettes of 150 anthems . After Quebec_City , the river widens into its broad estuary and shores recede into distant gray lines . Here changeable weather can surprise even a cautious skipper . The wider river becomes a magnet to wildfowl . You will see colonies of Atlantic_puffins along a deserted island cliff or hear the thunderclap of wings as half a_million snow_geese splash into a gray morning sky . On Ile aux Lievres , Jean Bedard , a specialist in duck behavior , directs a nonprofit organization , the Societe Duvetnor , which draws its name from the_French word duvet , meaning the down of birds . The lower St . Lawrence is also whale country . Foxtrot slipped now into the crescent harbor of Tadoussac , where Basque whalers worked the waters soon after Jacques Cartier , credited with discovering the river , landed in 1535 . A giant Victorian hotel is booked_up most summers as the town enjoys a new whaling boom -- whale-watching .</TEXT>
