   <HEADLINE> STRENGTHENING DOLLAR CALMS STOCKS , BONDS ; MARKETS : ADMINISTRATION ' S INTERVENTION IS A SUCCESS . MANY TRADERS STAY SIDELINED AHEAD OF APRIL EMPLOYMENT DATA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar extended its rebound against most major currencies Thursday , helping to soothe stock and bond markets . Analysts said the dollar ' s gains Wednesday and Thursday , boosted by market intervention engineered by the Clinton_Administration , suggested that the battle to strengthen the battered buck is being won so far . In New York , the dollar leaped to 102.85 Japanese yen from 101.85 on Wednesday . It also rose to 1.667 German marks from 1.654 on Wednesday . The Federal_Reserve_Bank of New York and the central_banks of 15 other nations intervened heavily in the U.S. and European markets Wednesday , buying_up dollars . It was the largest coordinated intervention by the leading industrialized nations since August , 1992 . Though there wasn ' t any sign of central_bank buying on Thursday , analysts said currency traders treaded lightly for fear of triggering more intervention . &quot; People are nervous about the central_banks coming_back , &quot; said Earl Johnson , foreign_exchange adviser at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago . &quot; Their attack was very effective. &quot; The dollar ' s ongoing decline this year , which accelerated over the past week , raised concerns about higher U.S. inflation and the flight of foreign capital from U.S. assets . A falling dollar boosts the price of exports coming_into the United States , and also devalues U.S. assets held by foreigners . The Clinton_Administration ' s decision to defend the dollar helped the bond market stabilize for a second day , traders said . Foreign investors would be more likely to purchase U.S. bonds if they thought the dollar would rise , because a stronger dollar automatically boosts the value of dollar-denominated assets held by foreigners . The yield on the 30-year Treasury_bond held steady at 7.33 % , and shorter-term yields also were mostly unchanged . But some analysts said the bond market ' s flat day had more to do with hesitation ahead of today ' s April employment report than the dollar ' s rebound . Wall_Street analysts estimate that unemployment remained steady at 6.5 % in April and that non-farm payrolls rose by just under 200 # 000 . A stronger-than-expected employment report could send interest_rates up again , in anticipation of another credit-tightening move by the Fed . * Meanwhile , stocks closed mixed in quiet trading Thursday , as traders there also awaited today ' s employment report . &quot; The smartest thing anybody could say about this market is that it ' s looking_for something to push it one way or another , &quot; said Richard Meyer , head equity trader at Ladenburg , Thalmann &amp; Co . The Dow Jones industrials eased 1.78 points to 3 # 695.97 , as declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock_Exchange . Volume was only 256 million shares . The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks , however , managed to edge_up 0.25 point to 740.55. Jim Weiss , executive_vice_president at IDS Advisory Group , said the market ' s relative calm in the past few sessions could be a sign it was nearing the end of its correction phase . &quot; The volatility is starting to dampen down , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re not getting the kind of swings on news we were getting four or five weeks ago. &quot; Among the market highlights : * Insurance stocks rose amid sentiment that the downward pressure on premiums is easing . Aetna rose 1 to 53 7 / 8 , Marsh &amp; McLennan jumped 2 to 87 , Chubb gained 1 1 / 4 to 78 1 / 4 and General Re leaped 4 1 / 8 to 120 7 / 8 . * Energy stocks also were strong , as crude_oil prices jumped in reaction to the outbreak of civil_war in Yemen . Light , sweet crude_oil for June settled at $ 17.29 a barrel , up 43 cents on the New York Merc . Also , the International Energy Agency revises upward its forecast for oil demand in industrialized countries this year . Among energy shares , Arco gained 2 1 / 8 to 99 3 / 8 , Phillips Petroleum added 7 / 8 to 31 7 / 8 , Chevron rose 7 / 8 to 87 and Royal Dutch advanced 2 1 / 8 to 107 7 / 8 . * Many health_care issued continued to advance . Abbey Healthcare rose 1 to 21 3 / 4 , Wellpoint Health jumped 1 1 / 8 to 33 7 / 8 , United HealthCare gained 1 to 48 3 / 4 and Ramsay-HMO surged 2 to 65 1 / 4 . * On the downside , electric utility stocks suffered another drop . The Dow utility index fell 2.11 points to 192.79 , a new 52-week low , resuming the slide that began last fall . Pacific Gas &amp; Electric tumbled 7 / 8 to 24 3 / 4 , San Diego Gas &amp; Electric lost 5 / 8 to 21 , American Electric_Power dropped 7 / 8 to 30 1 / 2 and Florida ' s FPL Group slumped 2 1 / 8 to 31 3 / 4 . Merrill Lynch downgraded FPL stock . Weak utility stocks often are viewed_as a bad omen for interest_rates , because they frequently decline in_advance of rising rates . * Auto stocks also lost more ground , perhaps on disappointment over April sales reported Wednesday . Ford fell 1 to 59 , Chrysler dropped 1 1 / 4 to 45 3 / 4 and GM sank 1 1 / 8 to 55 5 / 8 . * Among Southland issues , Encino-based security firm Pinkerton slid 1 5 / 8 to 16 5 / 8 after reporting that it barely broke_even in the first_quarter , despite higher revenues . The company blamed certain start-up costs for new accounts and &quot; strong price_competition &quot; in the security-guard market . Overseas , London ' s FTSE-100 index rallied , climbing above the psychologically important 3 # 100 level . It rose 35.5 points to 3 # 106.00. In Frankfurt , the DAX index eased 13.18 points to 2 # 235.84. Both the Mexican and Japanese markets were closed for holidays . * In commodities markets , coffee futures topped $ 1 a pound for the first time in more_than 3 1 / 2 years on speculative buying ignited by tight supplies . &quot; It ' s just a buying frenzy , &quot; said analyst Judy Ganes of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . Green coffee_beans for May delivery surged 5.45 cents on New York ' s Coffee , Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange to $ 1.002 a pound , the highest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Sept . 5 , 1990 . Coffee futures have rallied 27.7 cents this year , or about 38 % , as production and exports have dwindled due_to nearly five years of low prices and poor growing weather in some producing countries . Prices have also been driven higher by an agreement among 28 producer countries to hold_back up_to 20 % of normal exports . The countries began retaining shipments Oct . 1 but stopped last week when a 20-day moving price average reached 80 cents a pound . Their agreement requires the producers to begin releasing the retained stocks when the indicator price reaches 85 cents . It stood at 82.83 cents Thursday . Elsewhere , near-term gold futures fell on New York ' s Comex to $ 373.60 an ounce , off $ 3 . Silver fell 6.8 cents to $ 5.11 an ounce .</TEXT>
