   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY ; ' THREE STRIKES ' IS WORKING , BUT WHO ' S GOING TO PAY THE BILL ? ; MORE THAN 6 # 000 CASES HAVE BEEN FILED IN L.A. COUNTY ALONE , CLOGGING THE SYSTEM FROM D.A. ' S OFFICE TO COURTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the five months since the &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; bill was signed into law , many people have speculated about its potential effect on the criminal-justice system . My educated guesses about what might happen are becoming reality . Between March 7 , when this law went_into effect , and July 29 , my office has filed 749 &quot; third-strike &quot; cases , 1 # 998 &quot; second-strike &quot; cases and 3 # 469 &quot; first-strike &quot; cases . Second- and third-strike convictions carry enhanced penalties : double the usual term for a second strike and 25 years to life for a third strike . Obviously , a criminal defendant who is facing such harsh penalties will be less likely to plead guilty . Criminal cases are beginning to back_up and clog our already overburdened court system . Many more cases will go_to trial than in the past . What does this mean for the District_Attorney ' s office ? In April , I reached an agreement with the Board of Supervisors to accept a budget_for the coming year at the same level as last year . The fallout from &quot; three strikes , &quot; however , was not taken_into_account . My office was recently audited by the Grand_Jury . The conclusion : We are grossly understaffed and underfinanced . We simply do not have the resources to handle the increasing workload caused by &quot; three strikes. &quot; The new law does change the criminal- justice system , but at a cost . It will cost taxpayers a great_deal to provide the additional prosecutors , public_defenders and courts needed to handle the vastly increased trial workload that this law is creating . And the price_tag on incarcerating increased numbers of prisoners will obviously be very high , too . It is my sincere hope that our citizens , acting through their elected officials , will provide the funds necessary to meet the burdens of the &quot; three strikes &quot; law . It is imperative that the funds do not come at the expense of education or health services , for that will simply perpetuate cycles of criminality and we will never be able to build enough prisons . Some have suggested that the application of this law will result in Draconian sentences being imposed on hapless criminals who commit minor crimes ( but who , of course , have prior convictions for serious or violent crimes ) . I am doing my utmost to see that no miscarriages of justice occur . What many people do not know is that the law gives prosecutors the discretion to strike a prior conviction &quot; in the furtherance of justice. &quot; It is always the duty of my office to seek justice . If a defense_attorney believes that a wholly inappropriate sentence will result from his or her client ' s conviction , my prosecutors will consider the arguments presented . In fact , in a comprehensive policy I issued on &quot; three strikes , &quot; I gave my prosecutors guidelines to follow when considering whether a prior should be dismissed . Keep_in mind , however , that we will not dismiss priors or plea bargain in inappropriate cases . What I require of my prosecutors is the exercise of their judgment to fulfill our ultimate goal : protection of the public . Repeat offenders who pose a threat to our community will be treated as the law requires . I believe the &quot; three strikes &quot; law was passed because the citizens of this state were tired_of a criminal-justice system that imposed lenient sentences on violent criminals ; tired_of a system that had a prison revolving-door policy that did not punish or deter ; tired_of a criminal-justice system that certainly did not protect citizens from violent criminals . There are cases in which prosecutors have always wanted to be able to put criminals behind bars for much longer sentences than the courts would impose , and this law has given them the opportunity to do so . I remain in favor of the &quot; three strikes &quot; concept . It is my obligation to enforce the law , and I will do so vigorously and fairly , but I will also continue to be heard . I don ' t foresee any substantial change in the near future ; and if anyone currently charged with a second- or third-strike felony hopes there is going_to be a quick change , he or she has a long wait .</TEXT>
