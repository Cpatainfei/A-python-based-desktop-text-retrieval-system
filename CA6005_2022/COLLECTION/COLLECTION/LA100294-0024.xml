   <HEADLINE> PATH TO THE PRIZE ; ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU , BUT HOW YOU CAN WIN A NOBEL FOR YOUR COUNTRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You say I am a riddle -- it may be For all_of us are riddles unexplained Begun in pain , in deeper torture ended This breathing clay , what business has it here ? Some petty wants to chain us to the earth , Some lofty thoughts to lift us to the spheres And cheat us with that semblance of a soul To dream of immortality , til Time O ' er empty visions draws the closing veil And a new life sets_in -- the life of worms Those hungry plunderers of the human breast . . . -- Alfred Nobel * When the Swedish dynamite inventor ( and sometime poet ) Alfred Nobel died in 1896 at age 63 , he left an explosive legacy . His estate -- worth an estimated $ 9 million at the time and scattered across eight countries -- was to be invested in blue-ribbon securities . The annual income was to be divided in five equal parts and used to bestow five annual awards &quot; as prizes to those who , during the course of each year , have been of the greatest service to mankind. &quot; Nobel , who never married and had no immediate family , apparently believed that large fortunes should not be inherited . Nobel ' s nieces and nephews -- save one , Emanuel -- vigorously fought the terms of the will for three years , at one point even engaging the King of Sweden to argue with Emanuel that his uncle had &quot; been misled by peace fanatics. &quot; Nobel ' s fellow Swedes were none too happy when the details of his bequest became public . Many inhabitants of the impoverished and largely agricultural country were unhappy with the idea that such a vast fortune might benefit foreigners . Nobel instructed that three of the awards were to recognize discoveries in chemistry , physics and medicine , three areas in which he had worked or dabbled . The Peace Prize was to be given to the person who had done the most &quot; for fraternity among nations , for abolition or reduction of standing_armies , and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. &quot; Nobel delegated this task to the Norwegian parliament to honor the union of Sweden and Norway . Although the two countries parted in 1905 , Norway still presents the prize . An annual prize for economics , established and financed by the Bank of Sweden , was established in Nobel ' s name in 1968 . The final award was to go_to the person who had produced the most outstanding literary_work of an &quot; ideal tendency. &quot; In addition , Nobel wrote : &quot; It is my express wish that , when the prizes are awarded , there shall be no kind of racial discrimination , wherefore the most worthy person shall receive the prize , whether he is a Scandinavian or not. &quot; After five years of haggling over Nobel ' s will and estate , the executors finally created the Nobel Foundation to oversee the institutes that administer the prizes , and to enforce the prize rules . The Swedish Academy of Letters -- an association of writers and academics established by King Gustav III in 1786 to promote Swedish language and literature -- was charged with choosing the annual winners of one of the world ' s richest literary awards . Members of the Academy are Swedish writers and literary scholars and critics who are elected for life by the Academy itself . That Special Something Each generation of the Academy has redefined its sense of what Nobel meant by &quot; ideal tendency. &quot; The prizes first reflected a conservative version of &quot; ideal tendency &quot; : a firm belief in God ' s order on Earth based on the family . Later , it was decided ( by interpreting a letter from a close friend of the inventor ) that Nobel meant a critical stance toward religion , the monarchy , marriage and the social order as_a_whole . In the 1920s and ' 30s , newly elected Academy members took &quot; ideal tendency &quot; to mean profound human sympathy and broadly humanitarian authorship . In the 1970s there was renewed emphasis on Nobel ' s wish to promote authors who were still active and the Academy began to emphasize what it called neglected pioneers , masters , genres , languages and cultures . Members of the Academy also thought the prize should bring attention to writers not necessarily known to a worldwide audience . One Academy member said the prize should bring attention to writers on &quot; efforts which are not gaining the respect they deserve. &quot; Making the Short_List No writer can apply for a Nobel Prize . Indeed , self-nomination can rule one out for life . Rather , according to the Academy statutes : &quot; The right to nominate candidates for the prize shall be enjoyed by members of the Swedish Academy and of other academies , institutions , and societies , who are similar to it in constitution and purpose ; by professors of literature , Nobel prize_winners of literature , and presidents of those societies of authors that are representative of the literary production of their respective countries. &quot; A subgroup of the Academy -- the Nobel Committee -- reviews the nominations it receives from former laureates , academics and various institutions worldwide that have an interest in literature . From this list , the committee forms a secret &quot; short_list &quot; of writers whose works are to be scrutinized and debated by the entire Academy . Near the end of May , the &quot; short_list &quot; is distributed to all Academy members so that they can spend their summer holidays reading and briefing themselves for the fall discussions that lead to the choice of that year ' s laureate . Nominations must be received no later than Feb . 1 of each year ( Tolstoy ' s backers learned this rule the hard way : In 1901 , they failed to nominate him in time , and the first Nobel went_to Sully Prudhomme of France , despite the fact that it had been quite some time since he had produced his great works . Tolstoy never did receive a Nobel. ) Writers also apparently cannot hope to reach the final stages of consideration unless they have been nominated several years in a row . The annual list of candidates is a closely guarded secret , as are the details of the group ' s deliberations . ( But the Academy ' s records are opened after 50 years , and this has allowed insight into why some candidates were accepted or rejected , resulting in numerous books and articles on the selection process itself. ) The names of the nominees are not published , there is never any announcement regarding the proportion of votes , and the decision of the Academy cannot be appealed . When the Academy makes its decision , 12 of its 18 members must be present or have sent_in ballots . If no candidate receives more_than half the votes , the awarding of the prize is postponed , and may be reserved until the following year . This has happened 13 times in the history of the awards , primarily during World_Wars I and II , when the world situation prevented the gathering of information required to reach a decision . If the prize is not awarded in the second year , the prize_money reverts to the foundation . And the Award Goes_to . . . Nobel laureates typically receive a gold medal , a diploma with a short statement listing the Academy ' s reasons for awarding the prize , and a check for the prize_money . The statutes declare that the winner will give a lecture within six months of becoming a laureate , but this rule has not always been observed . If a laureate refuses the honor for any reason ( or has been made to refuse ) but later requests that the prize be awarded , the medal and the diploma may be awarded without the money because it has already been returned to the foundation . From the august manner in which the prize is announced -- the Academy ' s permanent secretary reads a short statement from the Academy ' s headquarters atop the magnificent Royal Stock_Exchange building in Stockholm at exactly 1 p.m. on a Thursday in October -- the casual observer might think the final_decision is made in a peaceful , orderly manner . Such , apparently , is not the case . Academy members understandably have favored candidates , and tempers often flare as they argue on their behalf . Back-room dealing surfaces as members agree to vote for candidates in return for support for their favorites in subsequent years . Historically , such infighting has been kept within the walls of the Academy ; the only way for a member to protest was to boycott the group ' s weekly meetings . Although politics is not supposed to enter into the Academy ' s decision making , it obviously has . In 1982 , when Gabriel Garcia Marquez won the prize , political implications were apparent when the Academy cited Marquez ' s fiction as &quot; strongly committed politically on the side of the poor and against domestic oppression and foreign economic exploitation. &quot; In 1990 , three members of the Academy resigned , accusing the group of failing to protest strongly enough Iran ' s death threat against British author Salman Rushdie . One Academy member said Rushdie was &quot; too controversial , &quot; and hadn ' t yet &quot; attained the literary standing necessary for serious consideration. &quot; In 1983 , Academy member Artur Lundkvist -- a radical novelist in his youth and 1958 winner of the Lenin Peace Prize -- broke the Academy ' s pledge of silence , telling reporters he didn ' t think that year ' s winner -- British novelist William Golding -- deserved the prize . Lundkvist claimed the Academy had split its vote between Golding and his choice -- Claude Simon , a Frenchman who Lundkvist claimed had had a &quot; Faulknerian &quot; influence on Latin_American writers . The Academy secretary said , however , that the group voted by a &quot; great majority &quot; in favor of Golding , whom Lundkvist denounced as &quot; a little English phenomenon of no special interest. &quot; Over more_than 90 years of prizes , the Academy has been criticized for giving prizes mostly to Western European and American writers ( out of 89 literature prizes , only 30 went_to non-Western Europeans ) , although this has changed in the last 10 years . These days , the Swedes show none of their initial hesitation over Nobel ' s charge that they administer the awards . The annual ceremony and banquet to honor the Nobel laureates is one of the highlights of the Swedish social calendar , and foreign press coverage of the awards almost always places Sweden in a favorable light . This year ' s prizes will be announced later this month , and Prize Day is Dec . 10 , the anniversary of Nobel ' s death . So , if you think you or someone you know is Nobel fodder , you had better get busy . The deadline for next year ' s nominations is fast approaching . Remember Tolstoy .

NOBEL CURIOSITIES * Jean-Paul Sartre refused his 1964 Nobel , saying he feared it would turn him into an institution . * George Bernard Shaw very nearly declined his in 1925 , but eventually donated the prize to a fund for the translation of Swedish literature into English . * The Soviets refused to allow Boris Pasternak and Alexander Solzhenitsyn to accept their awards in 1958 and 1970 , respectively . * After missing the deadline in 1901 , Leo_Tolstoy was rejected because he &quot; preached theoretical anarchism and mystical Christianity , &quot; and because he gave &quot; sheer coincidence a decisive role in world events. &quot; * Thomas Hardy was snubbed because his heroines &quot; seem to lack any religious and ethical substance. &quot; * Emile_Zola was rejected because of his &quot; crudely cynical naturalism. &quot; * Henrik Ibsen was turned_down because of he was &quot; negative and puzzling in an offensive way. &quot; * August Strindberg , who often opposed the Swedish establishment and referred to the award as &quot; dynamite money , &quot; was never considered . * Graham Greene was often nominated but never a winner . ( Academy member Artur Lundkvist revealed once that he considered Greene too popular and that , in any case , he didn ' t need the money. ) Nobel laureates you ' ve probably never heard of : Jacinto Benavente Giosue Carducci Grazia Deledda Rudolph Eucken Paul Heyse Carl Spitteler Sully Prudhomme THE PURSE The value of the prize is determined by how the foundation ' s investments are paying_off .
