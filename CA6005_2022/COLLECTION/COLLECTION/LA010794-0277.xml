   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : BURBANK ; SCHOOL RAISES FUNDS FOR YOUNG SURVIVOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A fund-raising_effort is under way to help the family of a 6-year-old boy , who survived a rare blood_disease , pay mounting medical and rehabilitation bills . &quot; We ' re hoping we can fill the house and help this family , &quot; said Bonnie Popp , a spokeswoman for the Parent-Teacher Organization of the American Lutheran Elementary School in Burbank , which has organized a benefit_concert to be held Jan . 23 . Daniel Bridge , a kindergarten student at the school of about 100 pupils , received a bone-marrow transplant from his 7-month-old sister last year as treatment for Diamond-Blackfan syndrome , a rare blood_disease that prevented his own bone_marrow from producing new blood_cells . The transplant cured the disease , but the boy later suffered two strokes and was hospitalized at UCLA Medical_Center and Childrens Hospital Los Angeles . The strokes will require years of rehabilitative therapy . The parent-teacher group has put_together a benefit_concert featuring Craig ' N Co. , a rock_band geared toward children and led by Craig Taubman , a Disney Co . recording artist popular_with children . The concert will be held at the Burroughs High_School auditorium . &quot; It has certainly shown us how much we need one another , &quot; said Daniel ' s mother , Melissa Bridge . Daniel is one of five Bridge children . &quot; We are amazed at the love shown to us by the people. &quot; ED BOND</TEXT>
