   <HEADLINE> MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ : HERE ' S THE SCOOP ; BRACE YOURSELF : THE ICE_CREAM WARS ARE HEATING UP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you don ' t like ice_cream , you ' re going to hate this summer . Summer is to ice_cream sales what winter is to sales of chicken noodle soup . About half of all_the ice_cream and frozen_yogurt sold this year will be dished_out over the next four months . And following three years of virtually flat sales , ice_cream makers are mounting a massive effort to whip_up excitement in the $ 11-billion industry . On tap are gobs of new products , stepped-up marketing efforts and a_few oddball items resurrected from the ice_cream graveyard . &quot; It ' s an utter free-for-all , &quot; said Jerry Dryer , a food industry consultant who specializes in the dairy industry . &quot; There ' s still not one true national brand of ice_cream out there . But everyone thinks they can be just that. &quot; that ' s why Ben &amp; Jerry ' s has unleashed its first-ever national ad_campaign , featuring such 1960s social activists as Bobby Seale , co-founder of the Black Panther Party , eating vanilla_ice_cream . Baskin-Robbins , struggling to bolster its staid reputation , is about to break its biggest-ever ad_campaign . And this line in a Haagen-Dazs TV spot , showing a couple in a suggestive bedroom scene , implies that eating its ice_cream is better than sex : &quot; At 11:30 at night , there ' s one thing better than sleep. &quot; Still , advertising can ' t solve one of the industry ' s biggest problems : how to simultaneously appeal_to health-conscious consumers and lovers of calorie-laden , chunk-filled brands . The ice_cream kings are agonizing over whether Americans will increasingly turn_to more health-conscious products like nonfat yogurts and sorbets , or continue to pay two bucks a scoop for an ever-broadening batch of super premium products . So , they are churning_out more of everything . Despite several years of flat sales , industry consultants expect the improving economy and an array of new products to help boost sales 5 % or more this year . This optimism has helped to trigger the new marketing campaigns . Even so , there is concern among industry_analysts . &quot; Consumers are not consistent , &quot; said Jeff Reiter , senior editor at Dairy Foods magazine . &quot; During the week they might want fat-free frozen_yogurt , but on the weekend they may splurge with a double-scoop of chocolate-chip cookie dough. &quot; This has left everyone mimicking everyone else . Baskin-Robbins is stealing a page from Ben &amp; Jerry ' s book with a new_line of frozen_yogurt filled with chunks of fruit and candy . Haagen-Dazs is testing to see if consumers will buy its fruit-flavored sorbet at the supermarket . And Ben &amp; Jerry ' s has finally introduced a &quot; smooth , no chunks &quot; line as its belated admission that , to stay alive in the ice_cream business , you ' d better sell a lot of no-frills chocolate and vanilla . Even the usually stodgy Dairy Queen chain is repackaging and reintroducing its Mr. Misty drinks as Misty Slushes . &quot; We ' re getting gender-sensitive here , &quot; explained Gary See , vice_president of marketing at International Dairy Queen . Meanwhile , just as some are adding chunks to their ice_cream , others are adding lines without them . &quot; Ice_cream is really about childhood , &quot; said Carol Moog , a psychologist and ad consultant . &quot; But if your ice_cream is all filled with too many chunks and other hardware , it loses the essence of its sensuality. &quot; * But Ben &amp; Jerry ' s says it is introducing its chunk-free line for a more practical reason : more_than 25 % of all ice_cream sold is vanilla . And while supermarkets were happy to stock Ben &amp; Jerry ' s chunky flavors , few wanted to carry their vanilla or chocolate flavors , said Holly Alves , marketing manager at Ben &amp; Jerry ' s . To convince grocers that it is serious about vanilla and chocolate , Ben &amp; Jerry ' s decided to build an entire line around the flavors . One of the toughest things was figuring_out names for the new flavors . After all , Ben &amp; Jerry ' s has built its reputation concocting crazy names for its ice_creams , like Cherry Garcia and Chunky Monkey . Among the names it considered for the smooth vanilla : Thrilla Vanilla . The company finally decided to play it straight and simply call it vanilla . &quot; While everyone is trying to come_up with Ben &amp; Jerry ' s names for their ice_creams , we decided to call them what they are , &quot; Alves said . But the &quot; smooth &quot; line has not been a hot seller at the chain ' s 15 franchise stores in California , said Michael Gale , president of Los Angeles-based Ben &amp; Jerry ' s of California . The biggest seller these days is the nonfat yogurt being tested at its five Los Angeles stores . Ben &amp; Jerry ' s is also recycling a flavor that it scrapped years ago -- &quot; White_Russian , &quot; which , like the drink , is made with coffee , sweet cream and Kahlua . Meanwhile , rival Haagen-Dazs is testing consumer response in Los Angeles to five new sorbet flavors sold at supermarkets . The sorbet , which it promotes as &quot; % fat , 100 % Haagen-Dazs , &quot; tastes somewhat like a rich , fruit sherbet but contains no dairy ingredients . Haagen-Dazs figures the best way to boost sales is to make_it available everywhere . So the company recently struck deals to have its products sold everywhere from special freezers at Blockbuster Video stores to room service menus at Hyatt hotels , spokesman Dave Gilman said . After years of watching Ben &amp; Jerry ' s and Haagen-Dazs eat_away at its market share , Baskin-Robbins is finally fighting_back with an $ 18-million ad_campaign . It features an eccentric &quot; Wizard of Wonders &quot; who concocts all sorts of new treats . * Just six weeks after its introduction , Cappuccino Blast , a sort of cappuccino milkshake , has emerged as Baskin-Robbins ' most successful new product in a decade , said Larry Kurzweil , vice_president of marketing for the Glendale-based company . This month the firm is introducing &quot; Yogurt Gone Crazy , &quot; a line of hard-scoop frozen yogurts . The yogurts are filled with chunky goodies and have Ben &amp; Jerry-like names such_as &quot; Boom Choco Choco Laka &quot; and &quot; Raspberry Cheese Louise. &quot; But Kurzweil is quick to point_out that years before Ben &amp; Jerry ' s existed , Baskin-Robbins was christening its new ice_creams with silly names . Way back in 1961 , Baskin-Robbins called its peppermint with sunflower_seed ice_cream &quot; Astronut. &quot; But perhaps most original of all , in 1972 it dubbed its caramel fudge ice_cream &quot; Here Comes the Fudge. &quot; Briefly . . . The Los Angeles agency Asher / Gould Advertising has won the estimated $ 23-million anti-smoking ad account_for the California Department of Health Services . Western International Media will continue to handle media buying . . . . The Santa Monica agency Suissa / Miller has picked_up the creative portion of the estimated $ 54-million account_for Jenny Craig . The San Francisco office of J . Walter Thompson will continue to handle media buying . . . . The Los Angeles office of Foote , Cone &amp; Belding has won a portion of the $ 3-million account_for Honolulu-based Kauai Advertising Group . Crop of the Cream About half of the nation ' s ice_cream , frozen_yogurt and related products were sold at supermarkets in 1993 . Although private label brands still lead all others in ice_cream and frozen_yogurt sales at the grocery_store , they are slowly losing market share . Here are the top five supermarket brands over the past year * , ranked by sales in millions of dollars : ICE_CREAM Private label : $ 715.1 Good_Humor / Breyer ' s : 346.7 Dreyer ' s / Edy ' s : 156.7 Haagen-Dazs : 150.4 Ben &amp; Jerry ' s : 117.2 FROZEN YOGURT Private label : 94.2 Dreyer ' s / Edy ' s : 72.3 Marigold : 60.6 Good_Humor / Breyer ' s : 59.9 Ben &amp; Jerry ' s : 44.0 * for 52-week period ended March 27 , 1994 Sources : Information Resources , Dairy Foods Magazine</TEXT>
