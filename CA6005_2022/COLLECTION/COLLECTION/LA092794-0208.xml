   <HEADLINE> FAMALARO ENTERS NOT GUILTY PLEA ; COURTS : OCT . 17 HEARING IS SET FOR MAN CHARGED WITH MURDER AND KIDNAPING OF HUBER . GRAND_JURY INDICTMENT IS POSSIBLE ; PROSECUTORS STILL MAY SEEK THE DEATH_PENALTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A handyman accused of killing a young Newport Beach woman and keeping her nude body in a freezer for three years pleaded not_guilty Monday to the charges against him , including allegations that make him eligible for the death_penalty . John J . Famalaro stood behind a glass courtroom partition during the brief hearing in Municipal Court in Newport Beach as his lawyer entered a plea of not_guilty to charges of murder and kidnaping . Municipal Judge Craig Edward Robison set a preliminary hearing for Oct . 17 to determine if there is sufficient evidence to order that the 37-year-old former Lake Forest man be bound over for trial in Superior_Court . He is charged in the murder of Denise Huber , whose baffling disappearance in 1991 sparked a massive search that made her name a household word in Orange County . The district_attorney ' s office , however , could circumvent the public hearing process by obtaining a grand_jury indictment , which precludes the need for a preliminary hearing . Deputy Dist . Atty . Christopher J . Evans would not comment on the possibility that a grand_jury indictment would be sought in the case . Deputy Public_Defender Brian Ducker , one of two defenders representing Famalaro , said he has been notified that the district_attorney might use the grand_jury , but did not know for_sure if that would happen . Famalaro , one of the county ' s most notorious murder_suspects , has been held without bail in protective custody in Orange County Jail since his extradition earlier this month from Arizona . Huber ' s body was discovered in a freezer that Famalaro kept running in a rental truck parked in the driveway of his Prescott Country_Club home_in that state . An electrical cord extended from the freezer to Famalaro ' s house . Ducker said outside the courtroom Monday that he is satisfied with measures taken by the Sheriff ' s Department jail staff to protect Famalaro , who has been the subject of verbal death threats by other inmates . Famalaro is being held_in a single-person cell and is escorted by an Orange County sheriff ' s deputy whenever he leaves it , officials have said . Huber , then 23 , was a UCI graduate working as a waitress and department_store clerk when she vanished June 3 , 1991 , after attending a rock_concert in Inglewood . Her car was found with a flat_tire on the shoulder of the Corona del Mar Freeway in Costa Mesa , less than two miles from her parents ' Newport Beach home , where she was living . Her disappearance remained a mystery until July 13 of this year when Arizona authorities , tipped that the rental truck had been reported stolen when Famalaro failed to return it on_time , made the gruesome discovery . Arizona deputies forced open the truck , believing that Famalaro had concealed drugs or drug-processing equipment in it . Instead , they found the freezer containing Huber ' s body . Famalaro already pleaded not_guilty to the killing in Arizona , where he was originally charged with murder before jurisdiction in the case was transferred to California . Orange County authorities sought to have his case transferred here after they discovered traces of Huber ' s blood in a Laguna Hills storage facility , where Famalaro was living at the time of her disappearance . Authorities believe Famalaro lured Huber into his car , possibly under the guise of helping a stranded motorist , and then later bludgeoned her to death in the storage facility . Deputy Dist . Atty . Evans declined to comment Monday on whether the autopsy or other tests indicated that Huber had been sexually assaulted . Ducker also declined to talk further about the case and his client , saying he and co-counsel Leonard Gumlia are still reviewing some 4 # 000 pages of police reports and other documents . He said he ' s expecting another 5 # 000 to 6 # 000 pages of documents . Famalaro could face the death_penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted of the charges against him . But a committee of Orange County prosecutors who decide which cases warrant death_penalty treatment have yet to make a decision in Famalaro ' s case .</TEXT>
