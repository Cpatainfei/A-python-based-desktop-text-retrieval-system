   <HEADLINE> POLICYHOLDERS ' COMPLAINTS FALL IN STATE IN 1993 ; INSURANCE : THE BIGGEST DROP WAS IN AUTO COVERAGE . GARAMENDI SAYS THE SURVEY ITSELF AND REGULATION ARE RESPONSIBLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Policyholders ' complaints against insurance_companies fell significantly last year , according to the California Department of Insurance ' s annual consumer complaint survey released Tuesday . The biggest drop was with auto insurance providers , where justified complaints dropped from 2 # 801 in 1992 to 1 # 564 last year among the state ' s 50 largest insurers . Ohio Indemnity Co . was ranked as having the highest ratio of complaints among automobile_insurance providers , while American Bankers Insurance of Florida was ranked as having the highest among homeowners insurers . San Antonio-based United Services Automobile Assn . ranked the best among auto insurers , while Vigilant Insurance , Pennsylvania General Insurance , Insurance of North_America and Assurance Co . of America ranked at the top of homeowner insurers , with no justified complaints reported . Most complaints involve insurance_companies that do not pay_claims in a timely manner , arbitrary contract cancellations , disputes on amounts owed , surprise rate increases and misrepresentation of the type of coverage purchased , department spokeswoman Candysse Miller said . A justified complaint involves a violation of insurance laws or one in which the consumer could not get the insurer to respond to the claim or questions . Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said the widely publicized annual report , along with new regulations , have prompted insurers to clean_up their act . &quot; After four years of reporting the good , bad and ugly of California insurance , we are finally hearing fewer consumer horror stories , &quot; Garamendi said in a statement . But some insurers suggest that the decline in complaints has more to do with the fact that the department will have to start providing companies with details of its complaints next year in accordance with a bill recently signed by Gov . Pete Wilson . &quot; The number of complaints this year is getting closer to reality , &quot; said John Millen , director of media relations for Farmers Insurance Group , parent of Farmers Insurance Exchange and Fire_Insurance Exchange . &quot; There ' s no reason why our company should have been labeled the way it was for the last couple of years , &quot; Millen said . Farmers Insurance Exchange had been ranked the worst homeowners insurer for three years in a row but climbed 17 slots in the latest survey . &quot; If we agreed with ( Garamendi ' s ) premise that it is his pressure that makes our companies work better for their customers , we would have done that years ago . I think the change is coming from the other side. &quot; Many insurance_companies also disagree_with the way the Insurance Department determines if a complaint is justified . &quot; I really have a tough time accepting their definition of a justifiable complaint , &quot; said Steve Toth , vice_president of Ohio Indemnity Co. , which was ranked the worst auto insurer in the latest survey . &quot; We respond to every single question ( from customers ) . The department does not even notify us about these so-called complaints. &quot; That criticism was echoed by Bruce Camacho , vice_president of investor relations at American Bankers Insurance of Florida , which was ranked the worst homeowners insurer . He said the company had no statistics demonstrating specific problems in California and had recently been audited by the California Insurance Department with no negative comments . California Insurance Complaints The Insurance Department ' s annual consumer complaint survey ranked auto and homeowners insurance_companies based on the number of complaints that were ruled justified in 1993 . Companies were ranked according to the ratio of justified companies per 100 # 000 policies . For instance , a complaint ratio of 169.9 means that for every 100 # 000 policies , there were 169.9 justified complaints in 1993 . 10 Worst Automobile Insurers 03 # 32 , 12 # 11 Justified Complaint Company complaints ratio Ohio Indemnity Co . 76 169.9 Western United Insurance 56 78.5 Coast National_Insurance 32 75.7 Insurance Co . of the West 20 61.6 Sterling Casualty Insurance 28 50.5 Stonewall Insurance 34 45.1 Colonial Penn Insurance 21 43.3 Civil Service Employees 14 43.0 Claredon National_Insurance 32 33.2 National Automobile &amp; Casualty 10 32.2 * 10 Best Automobile Insurers 03 # 31 , 12 # 11 Justified Complaint Company complaints ratio USAA Casualty Insurance 1 0.6 Wawanesa Mutual Insurance 2 1.8 American Economy Insurance 1 1.9 Fireman ' s Fund of Texas 1 2.5 California Casualty &amp; Fire 1 2.8 Allstate Indemnity 11 2.8 California Casualty Indemnity 1 2.8 United Services Auto .
