   <TEXT> It ' s 10:33 on a Monday night when KMEL disc_jockey Kevin Nash trades his love ballads and Top-40 hits for a grittier mix . &quot; It ' s time to kick_off ' Street Soldiers ' tonight , &quot; Nash says as he lowers the volume on the mellow jazz blowing in the background . &quot; It ' s time to save some lives. &quot; Over the next four hours , Nash and hosts Joe Marshall and Margaret Norris take calls from : * A young_man who raps about rebuilding a life blown apart by his mother ' s murder , his father ' s shooting and his own involvement with gangs and drugs . * A woman who talks for 15 minutes about other people ' s pain before letting_on that she and her children are living_in a homeless shelter . * A group of rappers organizing a &quot; peace party , dance and talk_show &quot; to end a small-town turf war . * A jail guard torn by her concern for the women she sees behind bars . Through it all , Marshall and Norris , both of them teachers , mete_out advice , encouragement and stern warnings -- the kind of talk that might come from responsible parents , sadly lacking in many of their listeners ' lives . It is all part of a community-based effort to end the street violence that plagues , above all , minority youth . KMEL is the city ' s most popular_music station ; in fact , the first host of &quot; Street Soldiers &quot; in 1991 was the rapper Hammer , and the name was taken from one of his songs . But &quot; Street Soldiers &quot; offers no music -- just the harsh realities of the inner_city . And the effect is often gut-wrenching . A 16-year-old boy is deaf_to his older brother ' s warnings about gangs ; he says he needs his crew for protection . &quot; You don ' t need a gang , &quot; Marshall says . &quot; Gangs only exist to hurt other people . . . . You ' re playing with fire , I ' m telling you . Get out. &quot; &quot; At the beginning of your call , you said it ' s getting crazy out here , &quot; Norris says . &quot; Well , who ' s responsible_for the madness ? You are. &quot; Another call : A former gang-banger fights his urge to strike back at a tormentor who is &quot; disrespecting &quot; him . &quot; So the talk takes_away your manhood ? &quot; Norris says . &quot; Back_up a second . Did you really understand that question that I asked you ? I said , does the talk take_away your manhood . And you said , ' Yes ' ? &quot; &quot; Maybe you don ' t have the right definition of manhood , &quot; Marshall says . But &quot; Street Soldiers &quot; offers more_than words . Callers also gain access to an extended_family network centered around the Omega Boys Club of San Francisco , co-founded in 1987 by Marshall . Omega workshops provide academic help for college-bound students , job training for high-schoolers , peer counseling for imprisoned youth and violence-prevention training for gang war refugees . Marshall , 46 , is Omega ' s executive_director . Norris , 41 , is the club ' s academic director . &quot; They ' re like the father and mother of Omega . They ' re both nice , but they have that stern outlook . . . . They ' ll never let you go_down , &quot; says Otis Mims . Mims , a star high_school athlete whose addiction to crack cocaine cost him a college scholarship and nearly ruined his life , was coming_out of a four-year tailspin when he tuned into &quot; Street Soldiers &quot; last year . &quot; It was like a light going off in me , &quot; he says . &quot; Things just weren ' t right in my life and I knew it. &quot; Mims received counseling , academic help and tuition money from Omega . Now 23 , he attends Contra Costa Community_College , one of 110 young_men and women in college on Omega scholarships . Corey Monroe , 22 , discovered Omega five years ago . His mother died when he was 14 , his father had a drinking problem . Now he ' s a ready-for-work counselor at the Potrero Hill Neighborhood House , a youth center . &quot; There ' s temptation out there . You get teased a lot , being young , if you ' re not in a crowd , &quot; Monroe says . &quot; Being a teen-ager , you always want to fit_in . You want to be like everyone else. &quot; In the_Hunters Point neighborhood where Monroe grew_up , being like everyone else can mean skipping school , joining a gang , packing guns or doing drugs . &quot; I know a_few that have been killed ; I know a_few that are in jail now . I know a_few that started smoking drugs , &quot; Monroe says . &quot; None of the kids I hung_out with and none of the kids in the projects are bad . It ' s just that parents aren ' t there for them . They don ' t have role models. &quot; Marshall and Norris say optimism is a key to their success . &quot; We ' ve just got a tremendous faith in people . And the kids , we ' ve got an enormous faith in them , &quot; he says . But they also acknowledge the obvious : There are a lot of people who have sunk beyond their reach . In October , a stray bullet fired by one such person killed San Francisco community activist Maxine Hall , a woman dedicated to helping youths like the one who shot her . On the radio show , Norris urges witnesses to come_forward and identify Hall ' s killer for police . &quot; Who killed Mrs . Maxine Hall ? All of us who know and remain silent are guilty , &quot; she says . The hosts never lose sight of the fact that their listeners are constantly confronted with difficult choices . &quot; It ' s hard , &quot; says the youth who was struggling to refrain_from striking back at trash-talkers . &quot; Sure it ' s hard , man , &quot; Marshall replies . &quot; Life is hard. &quot;</TEXT>
