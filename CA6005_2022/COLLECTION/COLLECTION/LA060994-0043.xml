   <HEADLINE> EWING-OLAJUWON : MATCHUP FOR AGES ; GAME 1 : TEN YEARS AGO , THESE PLAYERS WERE AT CENTER STAGE IN THE NCAA BASKETBALL FINAL IN SEATTLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They have met before , this Patrick Ewing and this Hakeem Olajuwon . Also , Jupiter aligned with Mars and King Kong met Godzilla . &quot; It ' ll be like the Rockies against the Alps , &quot; predicted Don Donoher , coach of Dayton University , a victim . He didn ' t specify which was which ; we do know the Lord alps those who alp themselves . &quot; I would pay_for a ticket to see Akeem against Ewing , if I could get one , &quot; said Anthony Teachey of Wake Forest , another victim . That was back before Olajuwon decided to spell his name with an H , which meant heck for people who publish record books as well as_to anyone assigned to play him . It was in the spring of 1984 that Olajuwon and Ewing met at the summit for the first and only other time . It was the NCAA final at the Kingdome in Seattle . It was anticipated with sucked-in breath , 7-footer against 7-footer much as it is for the NBA finals beginning Wednesday night at the Summit with a capital S . Two big big men . You can hear the earth shudder under their footsteps . College basketball hadn ' t had a confrontation of post men like them since George Mikan and Bob Kurland in the 1940s . And what do Olajuwon and Ewing remember of their first confrontation ? &quot; I remember that we lost , &quot; Olajuwon said Tuesday . &quot; Just the fact that we won it , &quot; Ewing said Tuesday . It was a typical response from either or both . Actually , the event was more_than that , especially in anticipation . Olajuwon was the big man from Nigeria who ' d played handball and soccer and never had sneakers big enough until he came_to the University of Houston . As a sophomore the thought of ice_cream made him laugh . Ewing came from the island of Jamaica in time to play basketball in high_school before going_on to Georgetown . He was more polished , doing more things reflexively than Olajuwon , whose raw athletic talent simply glowed . &quot; He couldn ' t have been too raw , because he was the first pick , &quot; Ewing recalled . That was in 1984 . Ewing was the first pick the next year . Their meeting had background . Olajuwon had been an object of some ridicule as a freshman , he knew so little basketball . By the time he was finished at Houston , he had been to the title game twice and the semifinals once . And lost all three . He has not yet won a championship anywhere . Ewing played in the NCAA championship game three times and won once . It is his only championship . &quot; He has made us acutely aware of that , &quot; Knicks General_Manager Dave Checketts notes . Georgetown beat Houston , 85-74 . The great man-against-man that was expected turned_out , as if often does , less than expected . The giants largely canceled each other . The stars of the game were Georgetown freshmen Michael Graham , whose glare could have made small children cry , and Reggie Williams , who was named the MVP . In the post-game television interviews , neither could speak a complete sentence . And Olajuwon wept . Remember that Olajuwon was under the basket thunderstruck the year before when Lorenzo Charles made his last-instant dunk for North Carolina State to beat Houston . The year before that , Michael Jordan had stolen a pass with seconds to play as North Carolina beat Georgetown for the title . Ewing was a leadership figure for Georgetown , as much as John Thompson would permit any player to be a leadership figure . In an early round , Georgetown was_on the brink , and Thompson went_to Ewing at halftime and said , &quot; Hey , let ' s stay in ( the tournament ) a while . Take_over the game. &quot; And Ewing took the expression for his own . During the game and subsequent games , he would say , &quot; I don ' t want to go_home yet. &quot; The morning of the game , Ewing asked Thompson how he was feeling . Thompson said he felt terrible . &quot; He told me not to feel terrible because we were going_to be national champions , &quot; Thompson said . If anyone wants to see a parallel between that and what Ewing has been saying to the Knicks , go right ahead . Ewing was such a dominating college player . &quot; It ' s frightening , &quot; said Roosevelt Chapman of Dayton . &quot; He ' s like an octopus ; hands all over. &quot; In the final , if there was a key moment in their struggle , it was at 16-16 . Olajuwon rebounded and had the ball 3 feet from the basket . He faked ; Ewing never moved . He went_up and Ewing went_with him . The little shot rolled_off the rim . It was the last time Houston had a tie . Ewing had shown himself . Olajuwon still didn ' t know what to show . In the semifinal overtime victory , Houston was killing the clock and Olajuwon took two ill-advised shots . &quot; There are probably 25 # 000 other American players who would have known to throw the ball out , &quot; Houston Coach Guy Lewis said . In the final , Olajuwon made six of nine shots for 15 points and had nine rebounds . Ewing made 4 of 8 for 10 points and had nine rebounds . &quot; We ' re both 31 now , &quot; Ewing said . &quot; Older , wiser and smarter. &quot; Both of them appear to be_full of the thought of each other . &quot; If you win a championship , &quot; Olajuwon said , &quot; you truly win a championship. &quot;</TEXT>
