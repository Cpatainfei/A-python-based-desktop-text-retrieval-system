   <HEADLINE> A FESTIVAL SHEDS_LIGHT_ON TRADITION ; HANUKKAH : FOR FORMER SOVIET JEWS NOW LIVING IN O.C. , IT WAS A CHANCE TO OPENLY CELEBRATE THE HISTORIC HOLIDAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Victor Voronel was born a Jew 33 years ago , but he had never lit a menorah nor heard of Hanukkah until two years ago . Voronel grew_up in a small southern Ukraine town where the only synagogue had been closed under Soviet rule and converted to a treatment center for alcoholics . &quot; Nobody could pray to God there , &quot; said Voronel of Tustin . &quot; The closest synagogue was 80 miles away. &quot; On Sunday , Voronel and his family celebrated Hanukkah openly for the first time , free from persecution . The Voronels and eight other Jewish families who recently emigrated from Belarus , Tajikistan and other former Soviet republics gathered at a Hanukkah party hosted by the Jewish Family Service in Orange . Children screamed and laughed , playing with the usual trappings of the holiday for tots : blue and white tinsel , gold-wrapped chocolate coins and presents . But there also were lessons for adults , many of whom were hearing for the first time about customs other Jews have practiced for years and years . &quot; Several years ago , people couldn ' t wear Jewish dress or learn about the traditions , &quot; said Valeria Babayeva , 55 , who moved to Mission Viejo from Moscow three weeks ago . &quot; I had friends who were arrested for studying Hebrew . I ' m very happy to be here now. &quot; Babayeva and her fellow refugees traded stories from their homelands and ate Jewish culinary treats , including latkes , or potato_pancakes , and golf ball-sized sufganiyot , or jelly-filled doughnut holes . Charlene Edwards , director of social_services at the Jewish Family Service , said some Jews only knew about their faith because they remember hearing their grandparents talk_about customs they had practiced before the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 . &quot; They hear stories about their identity long ago , &quot; Edwards said . After the feast , established Jews from Orange County gave the newcomers a refresher_course on the reason they were celebrating , the religious and historical significance of Hanukkah , the Jewish Festival of Lights . The holiday symbolizes Jews ' freedom to worship . Staff_members from the Jewish Family Service recruited a dozen of the newcomers ' children to participate in a play that related the story of the rededication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem in 165 B.C. More_than 2 # 000 years ago , Syrians took_over the temple and commanded Jews to worship Greek idols instead of_their_own God , Edwards told the audience . But a leader , Judas Maccabaeus , formed an army , defeated the Syrians and smashed the idols . To illustrate , about a dozen children who played Jewish soldiers wearing blue yarmulkes waved neon pink plastic swords at three other children who played Syrians . &quot; Yeaaaa ! &quot; yelled the victors when their foes fell to the ground . The Jews needed to cleanse the temple , but only had enough oil to keep lights burning for one day , Edwards explained . According to legend , a miracle occurred : The flame burned for not one day , but eight . So Jews celebrate the victory , and the religious freedom it represents , by lighting candles on a menorah for eight consecutive days . Mel Roth , executive_director of the Jewish Family Service , showed the Jewish families how to light the menorah , and led the group in a chant as he topped each candle on a brass candelabra with a flickering flame . &quot; For some of these people , they grow_up knowing they ' re Jewish because of prejudice against them , &quot; Roth said . &quot; It ' s written_on their passports and documents. &quot; But after perestroika and glasnost , some people in the former Soviet republics started to gather to rediscover their Jewish faith . Young Jews visited other nations to learn Jewish traditions ; others listened to rabbis who traveled through Eastern Europe . &quot; I discovered Judaism , &quot; said Irina Shulkin , 31 . &quot; If you learn your roots , you start to love who you are . &quot; Behind you is a whole history , with a lot of heroes , and it makes me proud , &quot; said Shulkin , who emigrated from Lvov , Ukraine , three years ago and is now learning Hebrew . &quot; For the people who grew_up speaking it , it ' s their native language and nothing special . &quot; But for me , &quot; Shulkin said , &quot; it ' s definitely a big deal. &quot;</TEXT>
