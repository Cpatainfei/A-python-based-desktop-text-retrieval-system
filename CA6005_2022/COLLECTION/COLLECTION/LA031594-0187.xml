   <HEADLINE> TACO BELL , JOINING GROWING LIST OF FAST-FOOD CHAINS , WILL BAN SMOKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taco Bell Corp . said Monday that it will ban smoking at its company-owned restaurants and that most of its franchisees are expected to follow_suit , giving the Mexican-style fast-food chain the largest_number of smoke-free outlets in the nation . The Irvine-based company said it will snuff_out cigarettes , cigars and pipes at its 3 # 300 company locations nationwide on March 28 and that at least 1 # 000 franchisees also will ban smoking . Taco Bell ' s action follows similar steps taken by other fast-food chains , including No . 1 McDonald ' s Corp. , as the effects of secondhand smoke -- especially on children -- are being scrutinized more closely at local and federal levels . McDonald ' s said three weeks ago that it will ban smoking in its 1 # 400 company-owned outlets , but a spokeswoman said Monday that no franchisees have yet adopted the company ' s policy . The Carl ' s Jr . and Chuck E . Cheese chains banned smoking in company-owned eateries two years ago . And Arby ' s and Dairy Queen announced plans earlier this year to eliminate smoking at company-owned units . U.S. Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders on Monday praised Taco Bell , McDonald ' s and other smoke-free chains for &quot; taking this stand_for our children , who cannot decide their own environment , &quot; she said . Last month , the Texas attorney_general sued Taco Bell , McDonald ' s and three other major chains , alleging that they endangered the health of patrons , particularly children , by exposing them to secondhand smoke . It was not clear Monday what effect Taco Bell ' s action will have_on the suit , and spokeswoman Janis Smith said the company ' s decision to ban smoking is not related to it . &quot; This is something we ' ve looked_at a long_time and something our customers want. &quot; A yearlong survey by an independent firm showed that 70 % of Taco Bell customers who smoked and 84 % of customers who didn ' t favored smoke-free fast-food establishments , Smith said . Industry observers say that smoking bans are less risky for fast-food chains than sit-down restaurants . &quot; I think smoking bans will have virtually no effect on fast-food restaurants , &quot; said Michael Mueller , a restaurant analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco . &quot; You wait in_line , you eat , you go. &quot; But a spokesman for a tobacco_industry trade association said fast-food chains can ' t ignore smokers . &quot; Taco Bell ' s decision potentially alienates up_to 30 % or more of its customer base , &quot; said Thomas Lauria of the Tobacco Institute .</TEXT>
