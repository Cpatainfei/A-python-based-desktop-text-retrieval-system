   <HEADLINE> U.N. DEMANDS YEMEN HALT ATTACK ON REBEL CITY ADEN ; MIDEAST : CIVILIAN CASUALTIES , WATER SHORTAGES PROMPT SECURITY_COUNCIL TO URGE A CEASE-FIRE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alarmed by reports of heavy civilian casualties and dangerous shortages of water , the U.N. Security_Council demanded Wednesday that the government of Yemen halt its offensive against the main rebel city of Aden on the edge of the Arabian_Peninsula . But the Security_Council , in a resolution approved unanimously , took no action to punish the government of Yemen or to attempt to stop the 2-month-old civil_war by force . Instead , the ambassadors urged both sides to sign a cease-fire , accept international observers to monitor it and begin talks to settle their differences peacefully . The council seemed most concerned about the fate of Aden , the largest city in southern Yemen . &quot; The military assault on Aden continues , &quot; said Madeleine Albright , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . &quot; We are alarmed by reports of a northern ground offensive , renewed shelling of civilian areas and heavy casualties . We are further alarmed by the humanitarian situation in Yemen , including the interruption of water_supplies to Aden and the potential outbreak of disease. &quot; North and South Yemen united into a single state in 1990 . But the union has been a difficult one , with leaders of the less populous south , which had been a Marxist state , accusing the other Yemeni leaders of repression . The southern leaders proclaimed secession in late April , and the civil_war began . Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has vowed to seize Aden , a famous port_of_call during the days of the_British Empire . His heavy_weapons have the city of 250 # 000 in range , and U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reported to the council Wednesday that &quot; a major crisis is imminent unless a political solution is found , or at least a cease-fire is put into force as soon as possible. &quot; A special U.N. envoy , Lakhdar Brahimi , a former Algerian foreign_minister , has tried to negotiate a truce , meeting with both sides in Yemen and at U.N. headquarters in New York . Just before the vote , in fact , a southern Yemen representative pledged to Brahimi that the secessionists would respect a 48-hour cease-fire called_for by the International Committee of the Red_Cross to let relief supplies into Aden . But , as British Ambassador David Hannay told the Security_Council , &quot; so many cease-fires have been proclaimed and quickly abandoned &quot; since the fighting began . In the negotiations , Brahimi has found that the two sides cannot agree on the nationalities of the observers who would monitor a cease-fire . The government at first resisted any observers at all . In addition , the White_House , which is attempting to limit peacekeeping operations , did not want a standard U.N. force . In light of these objections , the resolution leaves the makeup of the observer force somewhat vague , not even calling it a force but only a &quot; mechanism. &quot; Ambassador Albright made_it clear that the United States does not want the Yemeni mission to be paid_for as a regular U.N. peacekeeping operation . The U.S._government pays almost a third of peacekeeping budgets . She said &quot; those nations closest to the conflict in Yemen have the greatest stake in resolving this conflict &quot; and that the United States looks_to them &quot; and others who might be interested to offer on a voluntary basis the resources needed to implement a mechanism that would supervise a cease-fire. &quot; She evidently had Saudi_Arabia , which dominates the peninsula , in mind as the main contributor .</TEXT>
