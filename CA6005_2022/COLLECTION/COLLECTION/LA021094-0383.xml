   <HEADLINE> THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS ; WHAT ' S EATING NOMINATED STUDIOS ? NOTHING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was the day the Oscars were announced and executives at Hollywood ' s studios were wondering how they could capitalize on the avalanche of publicity that naturally ensues when a film is nominated . For Paramount Pictures , the question was : What to do now that Leonardo DiCaprio has been nominated for best supporting actor in a quirky little film called &quot; What ' s Eating Gilbert Grape &quot; ? Released in mid-December , the film about a dysfunctional family in a small Iowa town has been seen only in a_few major cities -- a mere 19 screens last weekend . Up to that point , it seemed to many industry observers that Paramount hadn ' t a clue how to market the offbeat film_starring Johnny Depp as a young_man torn by his relationships to his 500-pound mother and mentally disabled younger brother ( DiCaprio ) . But Paramount officials said Wednesday that they have had plans in place for some time to put the film on 600 screens on March 4 . &quot; We felt we needed to go very slow , be very patient to let it find it ' s audience , &quot; said Barry London , president of worldwide distribution at Paramount . For Disney , the question was : What to do now with the rock ' n ' roll drama &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do with It &quot; after Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett received nominations for best actor and actress ? The film grossed $ 39 million domestically by the time it disappeared from most screens by summer ' s end and is scheduled for release on video in late March . A Disney spokesman said Wednesday that as a result of the nominations , the movie would now be re-released in an &quot; unspecified number of theaters &quot; for an &quot; unspecified amount of time. &quot; For Warner Bros. , the question was how to capitalize on success now that its summer hit garnered a best picture nomination and a best supporting actor nomination for Tommy Lee Jones ? The Harrison Ford thriller &quot; The Fugitive &quot; had gone_out of wide release around Christmas . Betting it could garner an Oscar nod or two , Warner Bros . made plans long ago to re-release 1 # 000 prints of &quot; The Fugitive &quot; this weekend . At Universal Pictures , the question was whether to stay the course ? Universal had already made plans to have Steven Spielberg ' s Holocaust drama &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; in 175 U.S. markets by this date while preparing it for worldwide release later this month . The movie has been difficult to distribute because of the lack of labs that can produce the black-and-white prints . Universal also had plans to increase the number of theaters showing &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; from 150 to 500 .</TEXT>
