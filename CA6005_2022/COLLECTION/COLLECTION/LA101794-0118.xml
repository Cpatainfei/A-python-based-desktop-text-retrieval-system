   <HEADLINE> GULF WAR LEAVES LEGACY OF HARD TIMES FOR IRAQI PEOPLE ; MIDEAST : THE EFFECTS OF U.N. SANCTIONS AND INFLATION TAKE TOLL . CHILD MORTALITY RISES AS FOOD SHORTAGES PERSIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At dusk , as the minarets of its mosques are silhouetted against a rose-colored sun sinking_in the autumn haze , this Mideast capital with its exotic skyline can still cast an enchanting spell . But in the hot , gritty light of day , from the bleak Syrian desert in western Iraq to the banks of the Tigris_River that bisects the city , a harsh reality takes_hold . Gone are the heady days filled with bellicose talk_of Iraq ' s having annexed Kuwait as its 19th province . Gone from the street markets are the mountains of loot taken from Kuwait . The souks no longer brim with bins of pistachios , almonds and raisins , sides of mutton and lamb , Western cigarettes and a profusion of consumer electronics equipment . Instead , the weekend flea_market downtown has become nothing but a sprawling bazaar of old clothes and castaway household knickknacks that can be sold for food money . From the empty open-air fish cafes along downtown Baghdad ' s riverfront to a forlorn outpost near the Jordanian border , the ravages of Iraq ' s Gulf War defeat and the ensuing , grinding economic sanctions are evident all around . Along Abu Nawas Street , on one bank of the Tigris , is a line of normally popular restaurants that specialize in a dish called mazgouf , or spiced whole fish . But on Sunday , a lone operator sat staring vacantly over a tamarisk wood fire . On the sidewalks , and in the narrow , dusty alleys , the baleful vendors are lucky to have a_few open packs of cigarettes to peddle , one cigarette at a time . Along busy Sadoun Street , a_few fruit and vegetable stands remain , but most Baghdadis hardly even cast a glance as they grimly go_about their business . &quot; It looks good , but all that is out_of_reach for most Iraqis , &quot; said one European diplomat here Sunday . Such jarring contrasts between past affluence and present hardship are everywhere in this nation of 18 million people almost four years after Iraq ' s defeat , followed by the most severe international economic embargo in recent history . * The government made a new appeal Sunday for the lifting of sanctions , with a senior health official warning of &quot; imminent catastrophe &quot; for Iraqi children who , he said , are dying of malnutrition at an alarming rate . Shawi Murqus , the undersecretary of health , told the Iraqi News_Agency that 29 # 558 children younger than 5 have died this year -- compared to 8 # 903 in all_of 1990 . Still , at first glance much of Baghdad seems to have recovered surprisingly well from its devastating Gulf War defeat . Most of the bombed-out structures , including the towering International Telephone &amp; Telegraph building , have been rebuilt . There are even new high-rises dotting the skyline . And all but two of the 11 bridges that span the Tigris have been completely repaired and are choked once more with automobiles and buses . &quot; In this aspect , they have done_well , &quot; said another diplomat , whose embassy here has close ties to the United States . But talk to an Iraqi here and there and a glimmer of another truth begins to emerge . An ailing 60-year-old grandfather , call him Adnan , confided in the dark of night that he is working harder than ever . He would prefer not to . But he still has a wife and five daughters at_home , the youngest only 8 . Life has been especially tough , he sighed , after food prices shot_up 300 % in 1993 . And just this month , the government reduced food ration packages of rice , flour , oil , sugar and the_like by more_than 35 % . To make ends meet , Adnan shuttles passengers between here and Amman , Jordan -- a rugged 12-hour drive across the desolate Syrian desert -- always stuffing his trunk on the return trip with goods regularly available in Jordan . The only thing that remains cheap in Iraq , he said with a laugh , is gasoline . With rampant inflation , an unprecedented black-market currency exchange is flourishing , with transactions often conducted with all_the furtiveness of major drug deals , complete with calls made from pay phones and late-night rendezvous in shadowy neighborhoods . &quot; You may_not need a cart to carry all your dinars , but a sack helps , &quot; quipped one East European diplomat here . Only four years ago , the Iraqi_dinar commanded as much as $ 3 ; now $ 1 can fetch_up to 600 dinars in the right places . Inflation has reached 24 # 000 % a year , even by a recent official estimate . * A restaurant meal ( with no liquor , which has been banned ) can cost 3 # 000 dinars or more -- probably beyond the reach of most of Baghdad ' s 7 million residents , who subsist largely on fixed incomes . Two chickens , for example , may deplete an average schoolteacher ' s monthly income . And crime has become a growing source of concern . One Baghdadi , a self-avowed good_Samaritan , said the other night that he no longer stops after dark &quot; for anybody. &quot; Just last week , foreign journalists on a government-sponsored bus trip to the southern port of Basra were beaten and robbed on a deserted highway by armed thugs . Still , the greatest wariness among Iraqis seems reserved for the possibility of new military confrontation with a U.S.-led coalition . Near the Jordanian border crossing , a young Iraqi customs official , stamping entry approval on a passport , whispers to an American : &quot; No war with Iraq . Please ? War no good. &quot; He leans forward from behind a grimy counter and is about to say more but pulls_back as a co-worker passes . The clerk quickly returns to his task , scooping_up the next batch of passports for processing . Despite such a pervasive clandestine aura , the tensions arising from Iraq ' s latest confrontation with the outside world seem nowhere near the level of four years ago , when war loomed . Indeed , diplomats said Sunday , there has been very little tension here except for a day or two , and that was caused more by the Clinton_Administration ' s quick show of force and aggressive talk than by the unexpected deployment of Iraqi troops near Kuwait . One European official , who asked to remain anonymous , said that several days before the Iraqi troop movements were actually under way , Iraqi officials circulated &quot; rumors &quot; in diplomatic circles of the impending deployment -- with the caveat that it would be merely a &quot; military exercise. &quot; &quot; I ' m not sure I believe that , but that ' s what we were told , &quot; he said . There is growing speculation among diplomats here that Hussein deployed his elite Republican Guard troops precisely as a gambit to refocus world attention on the plight of his nation . That assessment was shared privately by some officials in the Iraqi government working with foreign journalists . &quot; Life here may be hard , &quot; said one diplomat , &quot; but it ' s rarely ever dull. &quot; * WARNING FROM U.S. : Baghdad was cautioned against threatening Kuwait again .
