   <TEXT> When Alberto Tomba hits town , you can almost hear it . The 27-year-old Italian slalom star arrived_at the Winter_Olympics Thursday , accompanied by his usual entourage -- photographers , a personal cook , trainers , admirers . And one bottle of red_wine . Tomba would n ' t say whether it was for a victory toast . He will try to become the first skier to win a gold medal in three consecutive Olympic Games . He won the slalom and giant slalom at Calgary in 1988 , and repeated in GS in 1992 at Albertville . First , though , a little fun . The renegade playboy , known for his fast cars and insatiable thirsts , fielded questions here Friday . He revealed that 24 phone messages were awaiting him when he arrived . What ' s a sex symbol to do ? At Calgary , Tomba suggested that Canada rename the province Alberta to &quot; Alberto &quot; in his honor . In France , he suggested the &quot; Albertoville Olympics. &quot; What about Norway ? &quot; Lille-Tomba , &quot; Alberto said . Asked about the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan saga , Tomba said : &quot; In Italy , if that happened , if someone would hit me , I would just hit back. &quot; A very nervous , female Japanese reporter , trying to get_the_jump on the 1998 Winter Games at Nagano , asked Tomba about the cook who travels with him . Tomba responded : &quot; I ' ll cook spaghetti for you in Nagano. &quot; In a second of seriousness , Tomba did reaffirm that these would be his last Olympics , that he would go_to Nagano only as a tourist . Tomba said he has become more diligent about his work over the years , and that he will , on occasion , look_at his three gold medals for inspiration . &quot; Sometimes when I feel_like winning , I will look_at them again , &quot; he said . Tomba still has a_few days to prepare_for his events , Wednesday ' s giant slalom at Hafjell , and the slalom there Feb . 27 . &quot; I think I ' m more serious than I used to be , &quot; he said . &quot; I laugh because you have to laugh . Otherwise , you don ' t win. &quot; CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
