   <HEADLINE> N . KOREA AGREES TO INSPECTION OF 7 NUCLEAR SITES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> North_Korea sidestepped the threat of impending U.N. economic sanctions Tuesday by agreeing , after months of delay , to allow international inspections of seven nuclear facilities . The International Atomic Energy Agency announced that the Pyongyang regime of President Kim Il Sung has accepted the agency ' s plans and conditions for inspecting the facilities . The inspections are expected to take_place within a_few weeks . Although other issues remain unresolved , both the IAEA and the Clinton_Administration portrayed the new agreement as an important step_forward . Discussions will now move to inspections of two other disputed sites in North_Korea , although with no imminent threat of sanctions . The agreement came less than a week before a Feb . 21 deadline for compliance . If North_Korea had not agreed to the inspections , IAEA Director General Hans Blix had been expected to tell the agency ' s board of governors that it was no longer possible to guarantee that North_Korea was not diverting nuclear material for weapons in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . Such a declaration could have led to economic sanctions against North_Korea . The Clinton_Administration recently began talks with other members of the U.N. Security_Council about the possibility of such sanctions . North_Korea , in turn , had warned that it would consider the imposition of economic sanctions an act of war . North_Korea ' s willingness to submit to IAEA inspection temporarily defuses the controversy over its nuclear program but does not end it . The agreement covers only the seven nuclear installations that North_Korea has formally acknowledged are_on its soil . It does not apply to two undeclared sites where North_Korea is suspected of having disposed_of nuclear waste . The effect of the new agreement , in fact , is to put the dispute over North_Korea ' s nuclear program back where it was a year ago . In February , 1993 , the IAEA asked to inspect the two undeclared nuclear sites . North_Korea countered by threatening to withdraw from the non-proliferation treaty and then barring the IAEA from making routine inspections at the seven declared sites . Last summer and again two months ago , the Clinton_Administration reached agreements with North_Korea that U.S. officials believed would pave the way for the routine inspections . But on both occasions , North_Korea subsequently raised new questions and obstacles that prevented the inspections from taking_place . In Washington , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters Tuesday , &quot; We welcome the agreement , and we look_forward to the beginning of these inspections as soon as possible. &quot; White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers called the agreement &quot; a step_in the right direction. &quot; Last December , after negotiations in New York City , Clinton_Administration officials thought they had concluded a groundbreaking deal with North_Korea in which Pyongyang was supposed to allow inspections of its seven declared nuclear installations in exchange for a pledge that the United States and South_Korea would give_up their annual Team_Spirit joint military exercises . Under this arrangement , the United States and North_Korea would then move to a broader round of diplomatic negotiations in which the United States would offer such incentives as a normalization of relations and economic benefits in exchange for steps by North_Korea to give_up its nuclear program . But the deal between the United States and North_Korea was made conditional on an agreement between the Pyongyang regime and the IAEA on the terms and conditions for inspections of the seven nuclear facilities . And North_Korea quickly began trying to impose restrictions on the ability of the IAEA to make these inspections . U.S. officials said that until Tuesday , the United States had had no meetings with North_Korea since the December talks . One senior State_Department official denied that China , North_Korea ' s powerful neighbor and longtime ally , had played any role as an intermediary in working_out the settlement . &quot; I would n ' t say China was an intermediary , &quot; he said . &quot; But we ' ve constantly told them in recent meetings to weigh in ( with North_Korea ) . And we are confident that they have. &quot; Another State_Department official said that the IAEA had had a long list of things it wanted to do as part of its inspections of the seven North_Korean facilities . &quot; They ( IAEA officials ) got like 98 % of what they wanted , which is pretty good for any negotiation , &quot; the official said . But he would not identify what kinds of inspection activities the IAEA had decided to forgo during its negotiations with North_Korea . Throughout the negotiations , the IAEA was trying to avoid making any concessions to North_Korea that could be used as a precedent by other potential nuclear_powers , such_as Iran . But U.S. officials acknowledged that the inspections the IAEA will now make in North_Korea are not the same as the regular inspections it makes elsewhere in the world . A State_Department official said that because of the &quot; special circumstances &quot; in the North_Korean case , the IAEA will make a new kind of inspection , not yet carried_out in any other country , in which it will examine the North_Korean facilities exclusively for the purpose of guaranteeing the continuity of the IAEA ' s traditional nuclear safeguards -- and not for looking_at North_Korea ' s past behavior .
