   <HEADLINE> A RELUCTANT WARRIOR ; WITH HAITI , CLINTON REDEFINES THE POST-COLD WAR PRESIDENCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> War defined the presidency long before the Cold_War . In this century , every President who came_into office devoted to domestic policy was , sooner or later , confronted with having to direct foreign interventions . They stood as commanders at the center of total war . No one seems more aware of the narrow confines of policy-making by use of force than President Bill_Clinton . His speech Thursday night to arouse the nation to back his course in Haiti was filled with qualifications . &quot; I know , &quot; he said , &quot; that the United States cannot -- indeed , we should not -- be the world ' s policeman , and I know this is a time , with the Cold_War over , that so many Americans are reluctant to commit military resources and our personnel beyond our shores. &quot; Clinton ' s case was spelled_out with this large hesitation present in public_opinion foremost in his mind . The psychological momentum of the past impinges on Clinton . The intervention in Haiti , after all , may be just that -- certainly not a war as Americans have come_to understand wars . Wars are associated with crisis , dire threats to national security , even to our existence . The mere mention of military_action summons a range of deep feelings in the body_politic : fear and anger , readiness and withdrawal . We may recall air-raid drills , missiles poised , threats and counterthreats . The person ultimately in_charge of disposing_of these emotions has been the President . He is the chief_executive of crisis management . At the moment of maximum peril , he is in command . Theburden has been almost beyond comprehension , making the President at once a figure who has been handed the responsibilities of near-megalomania and extreme caution . For years we have lived_in a fail-safe system , fearful that with one mistake the Earth could blow_up -- and it was all up_to the President . Clinton in Haiti begins inevitably to redefine the post-Cold War presidency -- hesitantly , indirectly , but necessarily . For this is a use of force that is not a crisis , an intervention that is not really a war . To win public support , Clinton has had to explain a policy that is , as he put it , &quot; limited and specific. &quot; What he is conjuring with is more_than the immediate situation . He is circling_around the dominant image of the President in the 20th Century as warrior-chieftain . For most of this century , presidential leadership has been defined by battle . The role of commander-in-chief came_to overwhelm the other presidential roles . A President who is principally attending_to domestic policy -- which can never be a clear-cut matter , always requiring constant quarrels and compromises with the Congress -- seems , after all_the wars , not to be truly presidential . Only in combat , we have been led to expect , is the President filling the Oval Office with his authority . All the great domestic-policy Presidents were overtaken by wars and became defined by them . Woodrow Wilson , the first of them , came_to the presidency warning against interventions generally and heavily pledged to the Democratic Party ' s isolationist wing -- long headed by William Jennings Bryan , a true-blue Midwestern pacifist , whom Wilson appointed secretary_of_state . Yet , Wilson intervened in our hemisphere more_than any previous President -- even invading and occupying Haiti . After World_War I , Wilson was greeted in Europe as no American President had ever been before : A deus_ex_machina , a messiah who would miraculously settle all_the animosities that had led to the conflagration . The assistant secretary_of_the_Navy under Wilson , Franklin D . Roosevelt , partly modeled his early New Deal on the mobilization of World_War I . But by 1938 , after suffering tremendous losses in the midterm election , reform ground to a halt . Roosevelt ' s presidency , however , was recast by the looming conflict in Europe . His successor , Harry S . Truman , envisioned himself as a domestic-policy man -- having little experience with foreign_policy . In 1946 , after losing both houses of Congress to the Republicans , Truman appeared diminished to_the_point of imminently vanishing . It was more_than his battle_royal with the &quot; do-nothing Congress &quot; that brought him back to life . It was also the Cold_War , whose fundamental policies he and his secretaries_of_state , George C . Marshall and Dean G . Acheson , created . From that point on , any conflict , large or small , was seen in the context of the struggle between the superpowers -- a struggle that could never reach culmination because it would mean , as the priesthood of nuclear theologians described it , &quot; mutual assured destruction. &quot; Presidents after Truman could maneuver , but they could not escape the Cold_War . Their presidencies were framed by it . They all were shadowed by a ubiquitous military aide with &quot; the football &quot; in his briefcase -- &quot; the football &quot; being the codes to launch nuclear attacks . More_than any President of the Cold_War , Lyndon B . Johnson wanted to have it all : the guns and the butter . His Great Society was intended to complete the work of New Deal , but his belief that he could do this and also commit vast resources to a widening war in Vietnam opened a chasm that became known as the &quot; credibility gap. &quot; Richard M . Nixon consistently made the claim that credibility was at the heart of the presidency and that it depended_on trust in the President ' s war policy . Any doubt , he and his Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger suggested , radiated into an undermining of the U.S. position everywhere . Ronald Reagan ' s presidency was the Cold_War in its rococo phase : A succession of dying Soviet leaders ; military_actions in Grenada and against Libya , all tied together by the battle against the &quot; Evil Empire , &quot; and the climax of the happy ending with Mikhail S . Gorbachev . For George_Bush , the World_War_II pilot , there was no idea of the presidency apart from war . The invasion of Panama was , in fact , the first military_action taken without mention of the Cold_War -- though Bush made no explanation of the change . The Gulf War was a kind of valedictory to the wars of the 20th Century fought by our Presidents -- complete with Bush ' s borrowed rhetoric from Winston Churchill . When he left_office , Bush ' s legacy included U.S. forces in Somalia and a policy of stalwart indifference to the roiling situation in Haiti . Clinton , by now , has learned that even in a radically new_world and at a time when the public desperately wants foreign affairs to be kept at arm ' s length , presidential leadership and credibility can easily be eroded by them . The Cold_War was a permanent state of crisis and mobilization suddenly relieved without a final conflict . For all its terrors , Presidents automatically gained stature and authority from it . So , it is not easy to be released from its momentum . Clinton must deal with problems that are not crises -- but may be perceived as such . He must clarify his reasons for action -- especially the use of force -- against threats that are real but not vital . Our means may seem infinite , with no rival superpower -- but our ends are far more limited . With Clinton , it appears that nothing comes easily . He is assailed as indecisive , a veritable waffle , only seeking approbation . On Haiti , however , he is attacked by his opponents as taking too precipitous an action , flying in the face of overwhelming public_opinion . Yet , the threat of invasion was a prelude to a final gesture of diplomacy : On Friday , Clinton enlisted former President Jimmy_Carter to head a delegation that included former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff Colin L . Powell and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) -- good cop , bad cop , bad cop . The mission was to persuade the generals in Port-au-Prince to leave the country -- now . Clinton , if successful in Haiti , may be seen as having negotiated his first real crisis . For what we encounter in Haiti , among other things , is a crisis in our perception of the presidency .</TEXT>
