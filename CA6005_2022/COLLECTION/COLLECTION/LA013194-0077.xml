   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A : ROBERT J . COHEN ; EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR , LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF ORANGE COUNTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Legal Aid lawyers in Orange County are probably best known for suing local officials who try to ban the homeless . That enrages conservatives , many of whom oppose the idea of lawyers getting paid by government to sue government . But local Legal Aid does a lot of other things for the 15 # 000 poor people who come though its doors each year -- from divorces to going_after scam artists who prey on the poor . Staff writer Michael Flagg visited the Santa Ana office of executive_director Robert J . Cohen , 46 , to talk_about Legal Aid . * What are some of the scams being pulled on poor people these days ? Let me give you an example : There was one case that started_out simple and ended_up keeping about a third of our office busy . A woman came_in who was an immigrant from Afghanistan ; her husband was shot by the Communists . Her father was chancellor of the University of Kabul ; she was very much a middle-class person . She came_to this country after unsuccessfully searching for her husband . She got a low-wage job , and one of the first problems she encountered was buying a car . She didn ' t have any credit history . But she saw an ad in the paper , and she wound_up sub-leasing a car . Sub-leasing was a very big scam a_couple_of years ago in this county and across the state . * How did_it work ? People without credit histories would go_to brokers , who took_in cars from people who no longer wanted their leases . The brokers would take what they call a down_payment , but it was really for their services in matching buyer and seller . What ' s wrong with that ? The brokers would run_off . There were the sleaziest people in this business . They ' d have a cash flow of a couple hundred_thousand dollars in lease payments , and they ' d run_off with it and start a new business under another name . Or people who sub-leased the cars would run_off , and the people whose names were_on the lease would be stuck . So this lady came_to me and said she couldn ' t even figure_out how to make her car payment anymore . So I called the bank , and they said the owner had died , and they were wondering why the car was still being driven_around ! * What happened ? Well , of course they repo ' ed the car right away , and we threatened to sue the broker , so the broker kept bringing her nicer cars until eventually he brought her a Cadillac . But the repo men would be waiting by her house , and as soon as she ' d park a car there , they ' d take it off . There were literally hundreds of people in Orange County who ' d encountered the same scam . We had a Marine come_in who was about to be charged with murder because he had let his car go_to the auto broker , who ' d sub-leased it to someone who ' d committed a murder in it . We didn ' t get much help from the police because , frankly , they had more important things to do . We got an injunction , and we wound_up getting funding from the bankers association for our lawsuit . Security Pacific even helped the Afghan woman lease a car without any subterfuge . And the state Consumer Affairs Department drafted legislation that made_it a felony to sub-lease a car without the consent of the bank , so all this confusion cannot inure to the benefit of the sleazy auto broker . * Do you get a lot of these kinds of cases ? We ' re not doing that much consumer work these days -- only about 14 % of our cases . that ' s because the cases we ' ve handled on behalf of the homeless take_up a lot of our resources . We ' d rather not have to spend those resources that way . But we have to because , essentially , what local_governments are doing is criminalizing poverty when they try to force the homeless to go elsewhere with anti-camping ordinances . It ' s not a crime to be a poor_person . * What ' s your budget ? It ' s about $ 4.3 million . Two-thirds comes from the federal Legal Services Corp . Most of the rest comes from the state Bar . The federal funds have gone_up ; the state funds went_down . So 10 years ago , when our office only covered Orange County , we had 17 attorneys . Now we cover southeastern L.A. county as far as Compton . Our potential clients have doubled . And we still have 17 lawyers . * What about lawyers in private practice in this county . Do they do enough pro bono work ? The ones who are doing_it are doing_it a lot . But it ' s a small percentage . You have something like -- what -- 7 # 000 or 8 # 000 attorneys in Orange County now ? And you have 600 or 700 that volunteer to do pro bono . So most of them don ' t -- one in 10 , if that many . And it used to be worse . * Are there a lot more poor people than there used to be ? Yes . And in most places it ' s growing faster than the population at_large -- a big jump . My sense is that ' s true in Orange County too . I know our office got a substantial increase in funding from the federal_government because the census found we had a larger growth in poor people than most areas of the country . In 1980 our service_area encompassed 250 # 000 people ; now it ' s 350 # 000 . You see that kind of jump in the Sun Belt in_general . * Who are these new poor people ? Immigrants ? The dispossessed middle_class ? It ' s all_of them . The angriest are those in the process of being dispossessed from the middle_class . The hardest thing I do is tell them we don ' t have the resources to help them . If you have a meritorious claim or a good defense to a lawsuit , you should be able to get legal help . that ' s the way it is in most civilized countries . But we turn_away a lot of people . We have people who come_to us and say : &quot; I ' m an American citizen . I have a right to this service. &quot; And we have to tell them : &quot; No , the way this works is that you have a right to be defended if you ' re charged with a crime . But you don ' t have a right to access the civil courts with an attorney. &quot; * On homelessness . . . &quot; Our streets and our parks should not become our mental_institutions . It ' s a medical problem and should be treated as a medical problem -- or else it becomes a police problem. &quot; On city ordinances that try to ban the homeless . . . &quot; People in urban_areas see the problem day in and day out . They develop ' compassion fatigue. ' They ' re willing to do anything to get_rid_of the homeless , even if it means violating the law. &quot; On Legal Aid champion Hillary Rodham Clinton being in the White_House . . . &quot; After Reagan , we couldn ' t have a more supportive White_House . that ' s not the problem for us now . It ' s ' How much money will Congress appropriate ? ' &quot; On the future of Legal Aid . . . &quot; We ' re not magicians . If the money ' s not there , we can ' t serve all_the people who deserve help. &quot;</TEXT>
