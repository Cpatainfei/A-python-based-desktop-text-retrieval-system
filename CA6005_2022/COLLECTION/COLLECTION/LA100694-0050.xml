   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ALEXANDER COCKBURN : A CUBA POLICY DRIVEN BY SADISTIC ZEAL ; THE U.S. EMBARGO HOBBLES LIFESAVING MEDICAL_CARE . WHY DON ' T U.S. DOCTORS PROTEST ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States is killing Cubans every day . The victims are mostly over 65 , and they are dying from such diseases as TB , influenza and pneumonia . It ' s the kind of carnage registered in small upticks on a mortality graph , not as easy to focus_on as , say , a pile of bodies dismembered by U.S.-trained troops in El_Salvador in the early 1980s . But the killing , engineered by the U.S._government , is just as relentless . Cuba ' s crisis began with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the late 1980s , but real devastation commenced with the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 , reluctantly signed into law by President Bush in_order to head_off candidate Clinton , who had been eagerly promoting the bill in Florida . The new law severely tightened the 33-year U.S. embargo on trade with Cuba , banning shipments to Cuba from any subsidiaries of U.S. firms . Foreign ships visiting Cuba are banned from docking at U.S. ports for six months . U.S._government officials have been enforcing the 1992 law with sadistic zeal . They once banned a shipment of Colombian chickens to Cuba because their diet consisted_of American-made chicken_feed . Goods produced outside the United States containing less than 10 % U.S.-origin components aren ' t banned under the act . But the United States determined that by the time of shipment , the American feed was reckoned to make_up more_than one-tenth of the chicken . It would take the pen of Jonathan_Swift to address this level of bureaucratic madness . Would a Somalian kid fed_on humanitarian shipments be able to claim U.S. citizenship because he had been raised on corn from the Midwest ? The policy is sadistic and deadly . Cuba was able to import a European-made water-purification system that contained filters made in the United States . But the sale of replacement filters was prohibited . So now the whole system is useless . Deaths in Cuba from diseases such_as diarrhea , associated with unsafe drinking_water , have been rising since 1992 . Medical donations are sometimes permitted from private U.S. organizations , but only under maniacally tortuous on-site supervision . Cuba can buy_food and medical supplies from other countries , but pays about 30 % more_than U.S. prices ; shipping costs are anywhere from 50 % to 4 # 000 % higher . Under such duress , imports of medicines and medical supplies have declined by about 40 % . Substitution of some American products is impossible : X-ray_film for breast-cancer detection ; replacement parts for respirators , Spanish-language medical books from a firm bought by a U.S. conglomerate . Bibliographic searches are impossible for Cuban doctors , since they can ' t use the National Library of Medicine ' s MEDLAR indexing system . Between 1989 and 1993 , Cuba ' s overall mortality_rate rose 15 % , with a 79 % increase from flu and pneumonia attributed to lack of antibiotics . Since the Cuban medical system gives priority to women and children , the elderly and men are bearing the brunt of the shortage . Rationing protects the weak . Nonetheless , even though overall infant_mortality continues to decline , babies with birth weights under 5 1 / 2 pounds rose by nearly 2 % from 1989 to 1993 , wiping_out 10 years of progress . Cuba ' s health system has always been one of the great achievements of the Castro years . Childhood malnutrition disappeared . Immunization coverage for those under 2 is still higher than 90 % . The population over 65 increased from 4.8 % to 8.9 % in 20 years and life_expectancy at birth is 75 years , the highest in Latin_America . There ' s one physician to every 214 residents and the number of physicians continues to rise . This public-health system is resilient , and shows no sign of the sort of collapse suffered by nations in the former Soviet_Union . When a shortage of B_vitamins caused 50 # 662 Cubans to go temporarily ( and 200 permanently ) blind back in 1993 , health workers were quick in distributing the necessary supplements to every household . But Cuban people are dying because of the U.S. siege , and one question is : What is the American medical_community going_to do about it ? Almost all_the major associations have kept their mouths obediently shut . The only one that fought the 1992 bill publicly was the American Public Health Assn . When its own material interests are threatened , no group is more tigerish in self-defense than American physicians . Is it beyond the powers of one of the most powerful U.S. lobbies to urge its government to drop this barbaric siege ?</TEXT>
