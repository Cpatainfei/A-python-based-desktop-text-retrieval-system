   <TEXT> Traditionally , people turn_to two methods to determine the value of their homes : appraisals and something called a comparative-market analysis . Appraisals vary in cost depending_on the price of the home , but average about $ 300 for a $ 250 # 000 house.Appraisers review numerous factors including recent sales of similar properties , location , square footage and construction quality . An appraisal is a professional &quot; estimate of a property ' s monetary_value on the open market ; an estimate of a property ' s type and condition , its utility for a given purpose or its highest and best use , &quot; according to Charles O . Stapleton III , Thomas Moran and Martha R . Williams , authors of &quot; California Real_Estate Principles , &quot; 3rd Edition ( Dearborn Financial Pub lishing Inc. , Chicago , 1994 ) . Comparative-market analysis is an informal estimate of market_value performed by a real_estate_agent or broker . It is based on like sales and offers a range of_values including probable market_value . Agents will provide an analysis at no charge in hopes of getting a home listing .</TEXT>
