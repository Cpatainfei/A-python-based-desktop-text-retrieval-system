NEWLY FORMED ENTITIES INCLUDE A FUND WITH HUFFINGTON TIES AND AN EZELL TASK_FORCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With McDonald ' s gift certificates in his pocket and a list of names on his clipboard , Liam Weston makes the rounds of a Venice apartment complex . He is a Republican foot_soldier scouring the corners of the 36th Congressional District for evidence of illegal votes , one of dozens of volunteers knocking_on doors and asking questions : How long have you lived at this address ? Are you registered ? Did you vote_in the last election ? The fast-food coupons are for those willing to respond . Most do , usually confirming the registration information Weston has with him . But in an hour ' s time on a recent Saturday morning , he and his walking partner , Michael Davis , find two apartments in which the information doesn ' t match . The people registered to vote at those addresses don ' t live there . The names will go_into a file -- part of a loosely_knit but intensive effort to gather data that could be used to challenge the November election of some Democrats and , more broadly , to advance attempts to tighten registration and voting laws . From the streets of Venice to county registrar ' s offices , lowly volunteers and high-powered attorneys are toiling over voting records and analyzing precinct tallies . Small groups , such_as Weston ' s Committee for Election Integrity , are working with the Voter Fraud Task_Force formed by Harold Ezell , one of the architects of Proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigrant initiative . The campaign of Republican Rep . Mike Huffington , who has refused to concede his 163 # 000-vote loss to U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein , has hired Patton , Boggs &amp; Blow , a prominent Washington law_firm , to scrutinize the election results for irregularities . The Federal Recount Fund , a secretive fund with Huffington ties , has been formed to help finance the fraud hunt . Election officials say they have no evidence of ballot fraud , and Democrats dismiss allegations of a tainted election as the grumbling of graceless losers . But some Republicans are not about to let_go_of the issue . With it , they see the potential of not only contesting some Democratic victories -- such_as Feinstein ' s , and Jane Harman ' s in the 36th Congressional District along the county ' s southern coastline -- but also of gaining momentum to revise state and federal voting laws that they believe favor Democratic registrations . &quot; We have an opportunity to do something . . . . This is the day , &quot; said Ezell , pointing to a more receptive environment created by the rise of Republicans in the state Legislature and Congress . Never shy of the limelight , Ezell leaped from the victorious Proposition 187 campaign to the voter fraud crusade . A week after the election , he started_up the task_force , which he describes as &quot; a nonpartisan citizens ' action organization , &quot; but most of whose dozen members are Republican , including two conservative GOP legislators : state Sen . Richard L . Mountjoy of Arcadia and Assemblyman Bill Hoge of Pasadena . The group also includes Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich and veterans of the Proposition 187 drive . &quot; The thing that made me start wondering about this , &quot; Ezell says , &quot; was when I was looking_at the opposition to 187 . I was watching the vociferous anger against 187 and the hot pursuit . . . to register ( people ) to vote against 187. &quot; It made him wonder , he says , how many who were registered by opponents of the initiative were &quot; not qualified to vote , much less qualified to register. &quot; The task_force , which operates out of Ezell ' s Newport Beach consulting office , recently opened a toll-free telephone hot_line to take tips on suspicious voting activity . The group is running radio advertisements , including one on Spanish-language stations , publicizing the line , and buying small ads in newspapers throughout the state to solicit tips to the hot_line . So far hundreds of calls have come_in , ranging from insults to hearsay to reports deemed worthy of follow-up . Last week , task_force workers spent days in front of computers in the Los Angeles County registrar ' s office , comparing registration and voting records from precincts in the 36th Congressional District , where Republican Susan Brooks has refused to concede defeat in her 812-vote loss to Harman , the Democratic incumbent . The group is also using Patton , Boggs attorneys , according to Ezell , who says he is pouring some of_his_own money into the effort , which he predicts will cost $ 150 # 000 to $ 175 # 000 . But he is otherwise vague about the source of the task_force ' s financing . There are plans to file for nonprofit status , but so far , Ezell says , the task_force is &quot; just a bunch of people &quot; and does not have to disclose its donors . Pressed , Ezell says that some of Huffington ' s friends are contributing money and that he &quot; has gotten some bills paid &quot; by the Federal Recount Fund . Indeed , Dimitri Carapanos , listed as a task_force member when the group was formed , was later named as the treasurer of the Federal Recount Fund on a document request made to the San Francisco registrar ' s office . Ezell said Carapanos dropped_off the task_force a_couple_of weeks ago . As for the fund , John Nelson , a spokesman for Huffington , said : &quot; The people behind the fund would like to remain anonymous . They have the right to remain anonymous . . . . Michael Huffington is not a donor . He might be in the future. &quot; Still , Nelson said , Huffington is involved with the fund and gets daily updates on its activities . Moreover , in contacting county registrars , the fund has given as its address the same Costa Mesa office suite that houses Huffington ' s office . &quot; They might be sharing office space to save money , &quot; Nelson said . The fund is not stinting in other ways , however . A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County registrar ' s office said the recount fund has requested copies of every page of the polling rosters signed by voters in each of the county ' s 6 # 000 or so precincts in the Nov . 8 election . The estimated bill is $ 25 # 000 . Another fund request , for the precinct auditing sheets , will cost about $ 3 # 000 . While the fund is spending money and Ezell is beating the publicity drum , it appears that much of the hard-core election analysis is being conducted by Patton , Boggs . The firm has sent several attorneys to California , including partner Bob Hunter , an election law specialist who usually works_out of the firm ' s North Carolina offices . According to those familiar_with the effort , the Patton , Boggs team is scrutinizing a wide variety of records , including precinct tally sheets , registration records and postal change-of-address lists -- which registrars rely_on to see whether voters have moved . Pinkerton Security and Investigation Services was even briefly employed to get some information from registrar ' s offices . The attorney team , which has also hired some political_scientists for data analysis , is not just looking_for deliberate fraud . It is searching as well for discrepancies and sloppiness that would cast doubt on election figures . Even if individual precinct tallies are off by only a handful of votes , if that trend can be proved statewide , it could , in theory , add_up to the kind of numbers Huffington needs to question Feinstein ' s winning margin . All this is being done against a tight deadline , because elections have to be challenged within a month of certification . In the case of Huffington and Brooks , complaints could also be filed with the Senate and House , both of which will be under Republican control when the new session of Congress convenes in January . Ezell also says he wants to amass evidence to try to block implementation of the motor-voter law , which goes_into effect next month , or even get Congress to repeal it . Widely opposed by Republicans , the national legislation allows people to register by mail ( long the practice in California ) and at welfare and motor_vehicle offices . Despite suggestions by both Ezell and Huffington that there may have been widespread voting by non-citizens in last month ' s elections , the search for illegal balloting seems to be taking other directions . A task_force press_release earlier this month centered_on various alleged discrepancies in balloting figures in the 36th District , which is being closely examined because of the narrow margin in that race . Those discrepancies included differences between polling_station tallies and the county registrar ' s numbers , as well as differences between the number of cast ballots and the number of signatures on the polling roster signed by voters . Weston , for his part , says his group ' s door-to-door canvassing has uncovered hundreds of voters registered at an address they do not appear to live at , including some vacant_lots . &quot; To what degree is it fraud and to what degree is it someone who moved , I ' m not sure , &quot; says Weston , an El Segundo city councilman who has worked for several GOP politicians . &quot; But they ' re all illegal votes. &quot; ( According to election laws , people can vote_in their old precinct if they have moved within 28 days before an election , but otherwise they are required to re-register at their new address. ) Using a list provided by Weston ' s group , The Times contacted seven voters who were registered at one address but , according to postal forwarding information , no longer lived there . In several cases , the voters said they had moved a short distance away and either did not know they had to re-register or did not think it was that important . &quot; Oh , I didn ' t think it was that big a deal . I only moved five blocks away , &quot; said one man who returned to his old polling precinct for last month ' s election . In another case , a woman said she had never moved , but simply used a post_office box for her mail . Fredric Woocher , an election law specialist and Harman ' s attorney , dismissed the significance of the alleged irregularities so far cited . &quot; I have no doubt that occurs in every election . It is far from voter fraud , &quot; Woocher said . &quot; The notion of a coherent pattern of people ( who have moved ) running back into Jane Harman ' s district and voting for Jane Harman and not Susan Brooks is absurd . How would you organize that ? &quot;</TEXT>
