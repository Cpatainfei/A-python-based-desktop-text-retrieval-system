   <TEXT> For those of us who have the privilege of serving Los Angeles as appointed representatives of Mayor Richard Riordan , it is our job to initiate policies to make city government function better for everyone . that ' s why I wholeheartedly agree with your editorial ( &quot; Keeping a Hometown Industry Home , &quot; Sept . 9 ) , joining with the mayor and the L.A. County Board of Supervisors in urging the Los Angeles City_Council ' s approval of a merger of the city and county film permitting offices . Location filming often crosses jurisdictional boundaries . One-stop permit shopping for the film_industry would be as helpful to it as one-stop permitting would be for builders , manufacturers and other job creators in our city . Streamlining these oversight operations should be a goal of government at all levels . It was with this goal in mind that the L.A. City Fire_Department , through the mayor ' s urgings and our commission ' s direction , and in collaboration with the film_industry , devised a new and innovative &quot; spot check &quot; safety program to replace the city ' s filming oversight program in place for the past 60 years . We currently require a fire safety officer to be present around the clock at virtually all filming locations in the city . Our new program will provide_for periodic inspections at locations where the public is not present in meaningful numbers or where there are no open flames or pyrotechnics used . This innovative program will substantially reduce the film_industry ' s location costs ( the industry pays_for fire oversight ) while still preserving public safety . DAVID W . FLEMING Vice_President Board of Fire Commissioners City of Los Angeles</TEXT>
