   <HEADLINE> DEATH OF NORTH_KOREA ' S KIM RATTLES G-7 ; DIPLOMACY : NUCLEAR STANDOFF WITH PYONGYANG WILL DOMINATE TALKS TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The death of North_Korean leader Kim Il Sung sent a tremor of anxiety through the Naples meeting of the world ' s leading industrial nations Saturday . Leaders of the advanced nations sought to put the best face on developments since the death , but they privately acknowledged their deep concern about what many view_as the world ' s most dangerous trouble spot . And as they scrambled for scarce information , they said the death of the 82-year-old dictator would push the North_Korean nuclear standoff to the top of political talks scheduled for today . Although Kim ' s death temporarily shut_down talks between North_Korea and the United States over Pyongyang ' s nuclear program , President Clinton said he saw &quot; good news &quot; in the request of North_Korean negotiators in Geneva that U.S. officials remain in Switzerland for talks that may resume after Kim ' s funeral , in eight days . The talks , which entered their third round Friday , are aimed at resolving a dispute over what U.S. officials fear may be North_Korean use of radioactive power_plant fuel for bomb-building . &quot; We believe that they will stay with their policy and stay with their course -- that this reflects the feelings of the leadership in North_Korea , and not simply the feelings of Kim Il Sung , &quot; Clinton said . He noted that U.S. military officials had decided against calling an alert for the 37 # 000 U.S. troops in South_Korea after an inspection showed &quot; there was no evident , alarming change. &quot; Yet Clinton stopped short of praising Kim ' s heir_apparent , Kim Jong Il , whom U.S. officials have in the past described as erratic , dissipated and dangerous . &quot; I know something about him , obviously , but I haven ' t met him , &quot; Clinton said tersely when asked his view on the likely North_Korean ruler . The younger Kim has rarely been seen and has never met U.S. officials . Other world leaders at the meeting interrupted their economic discussion to interrogate Clinton on how he plans to react to the developments . &quot; What they wanted to know from me was what happens now , &quot; Clinton said . But he acknowledged that &quot; we don ' t have any more information. &quot; The summit brought_together the leaders of the United States , Japan , Germany , France , Canada , Italy and Britain . U.S. officials , clearly searching for hopeful signs_in a murky situation , said they saw some evidence that a cadre of officials , perhaps led by Kim Jong Il , was taking_charge . They said the fact that Kim ' s death was not formally announced until 32 hours after it occurred suggested that a leadership group was deliberating over affairs of state . U.S. officials went_out of their way to try to quash speculation that the death might be the result of a coup , saying they had no evidence that the cause was anything other_than a heart_attack , as officially reported . They said there were no signs of ominous troop movements in North_Korea . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , who said he had been in talks on developments on the Korean_peninsula since early Saturday , said U.S. officials will be &quot; watching this with great care. &quot; And another U.S. official acknowledged that no matter what the United States might want to do about the succession , &quot; we have exactly zero influence over this. &quot; Foreign ministers of Japan , South_Korea and Britain were quick to assert their view that the death will not disturb the unstable chemistry of the region . Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said he believes the situation will not &quot; negatively disturb the situation on the peninsula. &quot;</TEXT>
