   <HEADLINE> LATINO LEADER INDICTED IN DOCUMENT FRAUD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jose Velez , president of a leading national Latino civil_rights organization , and three Taiwanese nationals were indicted Tuesday on federal charges that they conspired to create and supply false documents so thousands of illegal immigrants could remain in the United States . The indictment , returned by a federal grand_jury in Las Vegas , said the immigrants were charged fees as high as $ 45 # 000 each for fraudulent documents provided by the alleged Taiwanese conspirators -- Bill Tzeng , Simon Chang and Al Feng . Velez carried_out his part of the conspiracy through his Las Vegas immigration consulting firm , Velez &amp; Sons , Inc. , according to the indictment . The organization Velez heads , the League of United Latin_American Citizens , the nation ' s oldest Latino civil_rights organization , was not accused of any wrongdoing . The indictment is part of a continuing investigation in Las Vegas by a Legalization Fraud Task_Force made_up of 10 Immigration and Naturalization Service agents , assisted by Internal Revenue Service agents . The indictment was released by the Justice_Department here and in Las Vegas . In the investigation related to Velez , six defendants , including Velez ' s son , Peter Velez , have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with investigators , the Justice_Department said . Ted Marshall , an attorney for Jose Velez , was quoted by the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Sunday defending Velez ' s conduct . &quot; He was clearly operating an agency with staff but he gave clear and implicit instructions that nobody was to be involved in any illegalities , &quot; Marshall said . &quot; If some of the mice were playing when the cat was away , that ' s one thing , but he insists that whatever happened did not involve him. &quot; The alleged conspiracy , which ran from March , 1988 , to about January , 1991 , sought to misuse the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 , the department said . The act authorized immigrants who had been living_in the United States illegally before Jan . 1 , 1982 , to apply for amnesty as a step toward becoming legal residents . Immigrants who did seasonal agricultural work for specified periods also could file another type of legalization application . The grand_jury charged that Velez , Feng , Tzeng and Chang conspired to provide false documents and oral statements to the INS_for immigrants fraudulently seeking amnesty . At the height of the alleged conspiracy , Velez reportedly received receipts , paid primarily in cash , totaling as much as $ 50 # 000 a day for his work . The indictment described how unnamed co-conspirators , called &quot; group leaders &quot; in the indictment , recruited busloads of unqualified immigrants to file false amnesty applications in Las Vegas . Most group leaders charged applicants fees ranging from $ 250 to $ 3 # 500 , although Feng , Tzeng and Chang allegedly charged some applicants as much as $ 45 # 000 apiece . The group leaders shared their fees with Velez , according to the indictment . It said that Velez and his fellow plotters obtained blank envelopes bearing Mexican postage and backdated Mexican postmarks , which when addressed to unqualified immigrants served as fictitious evidence of longtime U.S. residency . In Sacramento , Arnoldo Torres , who served as the organization ' s national political adviser during the 1989-1990 election that brought Velez to the helm of the group , said he warned the members that Velez was under investigation and could embarrass the organization .
