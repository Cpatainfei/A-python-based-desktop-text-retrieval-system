   <HEADLINE> NEW ASSEMBLYMAN KUYKENDALL BLENDING IDEOLOGY , PRAGMATISM ; POLITICS : LEGISLATOR SAYS ACCEPTING TOBACCO FIRM ' S $ 125 # 000 CONTRIBUTION HELPED HIM BEAT INCUMBENT , AND VOWS IT WON ' T EASE HIS OPPOSITION TO SMOKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If the state Assembly takes_up campaign finance reform again , Assemblyman Steven T . Kuykendall ( R-Rancho Palos Verdes ) admits that he might be singled_out . &quot; I may have taken what is the largest single contribution to an individual Assembly candidate , except for maybe Willie Brown , &quot; said Kuykendall , who was sworn_in Monday as the assemblyman in the 54th District , which includes the Long_Beach , Signal Hill , Palos Verdes Peninsula and San Pedro . Campaign reform would limit the size of contributions to state Assembly and Senate_campaigns . In the waning days of the campaign , Kuykendall accepted a $ 125 # 000 check from tobacco giant Philip Morris even though he is_on record as supporting anti-smoking legislation . It might look_like a contradiction . But this is how the political_system works , Kuykendall says . A more polished politician might be coy about it , but Kuykendall freely admits that accepting the money was a pragmatic move that may have helped him defeat incumbent Betty Karnette by 597 votes . Now , Kuykendall , an ex-Marine and mortgage banker , is facing threats of a recall launched by Sacramento Democrats . The state party has already filed a complaint over the contribution with the state Fair Political Practices Commission . But so far , there ' s been little protest beyond Sacramento Democrats . Kuykendall and his supporters dismiss the complaint as frivolous and doubt that a recall will go anywhere . &quot; It ' s something that he ' s always going_to to have to deal with . But I ' d rather accept the check and be the winner with controversy than be the loser , &quot; said Republican consultant Tom Shortridge , president of Bear Republic Political Services in Redondo Beach . Even anti-smoking groups say they are confident Kuykendall won ' t be beholden to the tobacco company . &quot; I expect we are going_to be working with him , &quot; said Paul Knepprath spokesman for the American Lung Assn . in Sacramento . This is not the first time that pragmatism and ideology have clashed for Kuykendall . Elected to the Rancho Palos Verdes City_Council as a &quot; read-my-lips , no-new-taxes &quot; conservative , he soon found himself justifying tax increases as a way to resolve the city ' s fiscal crisis . * He voted for a utility tax , which the council passed last year , and supported a parcel tax , which narrowly lost when it was put_on the ballot in 1992 . With the city in need of new revenue , Kuykendall suggested a referendum to ask residents if they wanted to hand control of the city over to the county . &quot; It ' s not a question of ideology , but whether a locally controlled city government can survive or not , &quot; he said at the time . The proposal went nowhere , but did get people talking . &quot; As a businessman , he had a way of saying ' Look_at this problem or we ' ll be in bankruptcy , ' &quot; former Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach said . And Kuykendall ' s supporters say that voters have little if any resentment over the Philip Morris contribution . Kuykendall notes that the tobacco giant has a number of subsidiaries , including real_estate and food_products . &quot; That company has got a lot more at stake than whether or not they sell cigarettes , &quot; he said . And ironically , it could be the Philip Morris contribution that ensures that he backs anti-smoking legislation while in Sacramento . Otherwise , opponents could gain even more fodder for a recall . &quot; He ' s not going_to be dumb enough to vote tobacco , &quot; said Shortridge , the Republican consultant . &quot; I don ' t think he owes them anything. &quot;</TEXT>
