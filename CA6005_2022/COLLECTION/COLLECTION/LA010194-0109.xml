   <HEADLINE> WALL_STREET SCORES WELL FOR 1993 , A SURPRISING END ; WINNING AGAINST THE ODDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wall_Street clawed its way to a third straight winning year in 1993 , overcoming early doubts about the economy , later fears of higher interest_rates and a growing diversion of U.S. investors ' cash to red-hot foreign markets . The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 13.7 % for the year and closed just under its all-time high . The Dow began the year at 3 # 301.11 and ended at 3 # 754.09 , for a 452.98-point gain . The blue-chip index hit a record 3 # 794.33 on Wednesday but slid a total of 40.24 points in the last two trading sessions , undermined by fresh bond market jitters . Still , analysts said the market ' s performance was impressive . While many experts had been expecting a broad market pullback of at least 10 % during 1993 , it never came . &quot; The things that fooled everyone were the mood , the money flow and the momentum , &quot; said Alan Ackerman , investment strategist at Reich &amp; Co . in New York . Investors ' mood improved as the year wore_on and the economy finally built a head of steam . At the same time , interest_rates remained near 20- to 30-year lows for much of the year , encouraging investors to draw record sums out of bank CDs and other short-term accounts and funnel the money into stock and bond mutual_funds . Those trends fed_on themselves , Ackerman said , giving stock prices the momentum needed to overcome numerous potentially crippling worries -- from Russia ' s right-wingers to rising gold and commodity prices to the expectation that the Federal_Reserve will eventually be forced to push interest_rates higher . For a third consecutive year , small-company stocks were the U.S. market ' s stars . The Russell 2 # 000 index , the purest benchmark of small-stock performance , rose 17 % for the year , bolstered by a rally this past week . The Nasdaq Stock_Market ' s composite index , which is mostly made_up of smaller stocks , gained 14.8 % in price in 1993 . Wall_Street has been touting smaller companies as being_better able to cope_with the rapidly changing economy . Investors appear to believe the story -- and that small companies ' earnings growth will continue to outpace bigger companies ' growth . The market ' s major disappointment in 1993 , relatively speaking , was the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index , the most widely used benchmark for mutual_funds that attempt to match the market ' s performance . The S &amp; P gained 7.1 % for the year . With dividend income , however , the total return is estimated at just above 10 % . While a 10 % return still handily beat the 2.7 % that investors would have earned by sitting in a money_market fund for the whole year , Wall Streeters say the S &amp; P ' s results since 1991 show that the U.S. market overall is becoming a tougher place to eke_out attractive returns . The bull_market , after all , now is 38 months old . U.S. stock gains might have been better in 1993 but for the avalanche of cash Americans opted to instead pour into foreign stocks . Most foreign markets turned_in spectacular gains , as interest_rates fell overseas ( especially in Europe ) and as investors worldwide bet_on a stronger global economy in 1994 . The Hong Kong market , for example , leaped 115.7 % for the year , with the Hang Seng stock index shooting from 5 # 512.39 at the start of the year to 11 # 888.39 at the close . Taiwanese stocks soared an average 79.8 % , German stocks 46.7 % and British shares 20 % . Passage of new_world trade accords in December , after seven years of international wrangling , boosted optimism about overseas markets , sparking an explosion of buying during the month . Indeed , the list of markets at or near new highs at year ' s end extended from Karachi , Pakistan , to Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , to Mexico_City . But some veteran investors now warn that foreign markets have become overheated and are vulnerable to a selloff . &quot; The intensity of the investor craziness about emerging markets suggests to me that a cold bath is in the offing , &quot; warns Barton Biggs , investment strategist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co . in New York . Many Wall Streeters fear the same about U.S. stocks , though the doubters admit they are beginning to sound like broken records . &quot; Nobody thinks the market can go_down next year , &quot; complains a worried David Shulman , investment strategist at Salomon Bros . in New York . Revived fears of higher interest_rates could be the catalyst for at least a short-term pullback early in 1994 , analysts say . Rates have been creeping higher in recent months as the economy has surged . The 30-year Treasury_bond yield , the benchmark for long-term interest_rates , hit a 20-year low of about 5.8 % in the fall , after starting the year at 7.40 % . The yield now stands at 6.35 % , and a jump late in the week is what tripped the Dow industrials . The bulls argue that interest_rates needn ' t move_up significantly so_long as inflation stays low . What ' s more , even a rise from the current 2.7 % money_market fund yields to 3.7 % probably won ' t be enough to destroy investors ' hunger for stocks , some say . &quot; The country ' s demographics are such_that baby_boomers are starting to step_up their savings rates , &quot; says Charles Albers , a veteran investor who manages the Guardian Park_Avenue stock fund in New York . &quot; Common_stocks are the natural thing for the boomers to emphasize. &quot; So far , that still appears to be the case . A Fidelity Investments survey of small investors in December found that 52 % of them plan on making new purchases of stock mutual_funds soon . that ' s down just slightly from 55 % in November , a high that had been reached only once before ( last February ) since the Fidelity surveys began in 1990 .
