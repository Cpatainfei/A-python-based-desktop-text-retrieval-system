   <HEADLINE> GENETIC BASIS FOR GENOCIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In your editorial , &quot; Genocide and Genes &quot; ( May 8 ) , you argue that genocide is a &quot; ' natural ' action &quot; and that humans , like lower primates , &quot; have a collective capacity for genocide. &quot; If this tendency is indeed a part of our genetic_endowment , then its universality as a behavior should be present in all cultures . Clearly it is not . Granted , 17 genocides between 1950 and 1990 is horrific , but this ugly statistic does not prove that genes played any role in the course of these events . What is needed is a close examination of the crucial historical , social , and psychological dimensions driving a society toward genocide . Nearly all genocides , like most wars , are group decisions , made by usually rational , though totally immoral men . ( Incidentally , do females also carry this genetic tendency ? If so , where is their representation ? ) The social , economic and political upheavals , the values and goals of superiority and power , the acceptance of violence , the fears and insecurities , the historical prejudices and racism , and the culture ' s strong obedience to authority are key factors common to most genocides . For centuries , scientists and philosophers have used the &quot; human nature &quot; argument to provide explanations and / or justifications for every human ill , from slavery and conquest to the inequality of women . Until your research biologist , Jared Diamond , isolates the &quot; genocide gene , &quot; I ' ll continue to believe that mass_murder , like war , is a planned group behavior that can one day be eradicated by humanity . Our destiny is in our hands , not in our genes . EDWARD MARKARIAN Van Nuys Your editorial underlines the difficulties of drawing inferences concerning human nature from the behavior of other animal species . First , you do an injustice to the chimpanzee . While it is true that bands of chimpanzees have been observed to exterminate rival bands , this is far from a common occurrence . The challenge for the student of primate behavior is to determine and specify the conditions under which this extreme , relatively unusual behavior occurs . While chimpanzee bands may_not welcome strangers and may pursue them , the conflicts are usually resolved without resort_to &quot; genocidal &quot; acts . The fact of the_matter is that humans engage in far more destruction of_their_own species than do chimpanzees or other mammals . Humans , of course , also manifest much loving and cooperative behavior in interacting with different groups . While we can learn much about the human species from the evolution and behavior of other animal species , we need to look_to those attributes ( language , self-awareness , culture ) that are peculiar to Homo sapiens for the source and mitigation of acts of genocide . SEYMOUR FESHBACH Professor of Psychology , UCLA As long as we continue to tell our children &quot; you are black &quot; or &quot; you are white , &quot; &quot; you are Christian &quot; or &quot; you are Jewish , &quot; &quot; you are American &quot; or &quot; you are Russian , &quot; there will continue to be attempted genocides . Only when all_the world ' s children are raised as humans , disregarding color , culture , country and creed , will Homo sapiens be able to overcome this tragic quirk of evolutionary adaptation .
