   <HEADLINE> LOOKING YOUNGER ; ASTRONOMY : DATA FROM THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SUPPORTS RECENT FINDINGS THAT THE COSMOS IS FAR NEWER THAN SCIENTISTS THOUGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have produced the most compelling evidence yet that the cosmos is younger than scientists previously thought , calling into question the estimated age of the stars and the Big Bang theory itself . Their calculations , made public Wednesday , are significantly more accurate and broader in scope than two other recent estimates of the age of the universe . Taken together , all three studies strongly suggest that the expanding fabric of the universe -- that void between the stars and galaxies -- may be considerably younger than the stars themselves . An international team of 22 scientists , led by Pasadena astronomer Wendy L . Freedman at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution and Barry F . Madore at Caltech , used NASA ' s orbiting telescope and a special camera designed at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory to determine just how fast the universe is expanding with unprecedented accuracy . That allowed them to determine that the universe is between 8 billion and 12 billion years old . This contrasts with more conventional estimates , based on the age of stars and less precise measurements of intergalactic distances , which range from 16 billion to 20 billion years old . While the work has Hubble scientists celebrating , the new calculations are beginning to create a major headache for cosmologists . The Hubble study , combined with the most precise measures available from ground-based observatories , apparently indicates there is a possibility that the way scientists view the universe is somehow flawed . Are the ages of the stars too high ? Is there an unexplained force at_work to accelerate matter in the cosmos ? Or is the Big Bang theory itself incorrect ? &quot; There appears to be a controversy growing here , &quot; said UC Berkeley astronomer Alexi V . Filippenko . If the current results are confirmed and refined through additional observations , &quot; then we will really have a dilemma , &quot; he said . &quot; It might lead to a revolution in cosmology which would be a very very exciting thing , &quot; Filippenko said . &quot; We may have to consider some new perhaps wild ideas . Maybe there is another force pushing the universe out or something like that . that ' s exciting . that ' s what science is all about. &quot; Freedman ' s team used the space telescope to develop the most precise yardstick yet for measuring the size , scale and age of the universe by determining the distance from Earth to a distant spiral_galaxy called M100 . Through the lens of its recently refurbished Wide Field / Planetary Camera , they scanned 40 # 000 stars to locate 20 rare pulsating cepheid guide stars in M100 , located in the Virgo cluster . Astronomers can use the variable_stars to estimate the distance from Earth to the dense stellar cloud . It is the most distant galaxy in which the cepheid variable_stars have been detected . &quot; The speed at which they pulsate reveals their distance , &quot; Freedman said . &quot; The trick is to find them. &quot; The stars are so distant and so faint that &quot; only space telescope can make these types of observations routinely. &quot; The accurate measurement of the distance to M100 -- 56 million light-years -- allowed them to calculate the velocity at which the universe is expanding , called the Hubble constant , which is a measure of how the universe has grown since the primordial Big Bang . That expansion was discovered by astronomer Edwin Hubble , for whom the orbiting telescope is named . The NASA team ' s calculations , published today in the journal Nature , indicate that the universe is expanding so fast that a galaxy about 1 million light-years away will appear to be receding from Earth at approximately 60 # 000 m.p.h. If it is twice that distance , it will appear from Earth to be moving at twice that speed . The galaxy M100 is receding at a speed of about 3 million m.p.h. &quot; This galaxy is the most distant object that anyone ever expected ( the ) space telescope to be able to get_to , and it was dead easy , &quot; Madore said . &quot; Now we know we can do Virgo . And in fact it was so easy we know we can go three times farther than Virgo . The space telescope is working_at a_level that is unprecedented , unexpected and beyond specification. &quot; The researchers emphasized that although the current assessment of the Hubble constant and the universe ' s age is the most carefully calculated to date , they still have at least three years of additional work with the space telescope before they will have an answer they consider definitive . &quot; The Hubble constant has been fraught with controversy for some time , &quot; said John P . Huchra , a Harvard_University astronomer on the Hubble team . &quot; There are also other forces that affect the way galaxies move and we have to work_on that as well. &quot; The speed at which the galaxies recede , for example , is &quot; modified , twisted and warped &quot; by the force of gravity in ways not yet well understood , he said . Without knowing exactly how much matter the universe contains , scientists can only guess as best they can how gravity affects the rate at which the universe is expanding .</TEXT>
