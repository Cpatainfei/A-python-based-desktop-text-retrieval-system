   <HEADLINE> FIGURE IN DENNY CASE ARRESTED IN ALLEGED ASSAULT ; POLICE : ANTOINE MILLER IS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SHOOT A MOTORIST . HE PLEADED GUILTY TO COMMITTING A FELONY ATTACK DURING 1992 RIOTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Antoine Eugene Miller , who became a symbol of the Los Angeles riots for his role in the attack on truck_driver Reginald O . Denny , was arrested Friday on suspicion of trying to shoot a motorist just three blocks from a flash_point of the riots at Florence and Normandie avenues . Miller , 22 , is accused of trying to fire a 9-millimeter semiautomatic_pistol at a driver from point-blank range after an argument , said Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker of the Los Angeles Police_Department . The gun jammed and did not go_off , Kroeker said . &quot; He got_in an argument with two African American males , who were seated in a car , &quot; LAPD spokeswoman Sandra Castello said of the incident , which occurred last Sunday . &quot; He ran_into a house and came_back out with a . . . chrome-plated pistol . He walked up and pointed the gun point-blank and pulled the trigger , but it was unable to fire. &quot; Apparently , Miller fired the gun before he got_to the driver ' s side of the car near 71st Street and Normandie Avenue , police said . The target of the attempted shooting picked_up an unknown number of bullet casings at the scene and took them to the 77th Street Division police_station , Kroeker said . LAPD detectives arrested Miller at 7:10 a.m. Friday after raiding a home where he was staying , Castello said . He was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and held without bail at the 77th Street station , police said . Miller , one of four primary defendants in the Denny trial , had been charged with premeditated attempted murder in that case but pleaded guilty in November , 1993 , to lesser charges of felonious assault and two related misdemeanor counts . In exchange for his plea , he was given no prison time and placed on 27 months of probation . At the time , Supervising Superior_Court Judge Cecil J . Mills repeatedly stressed to Miller that he would not hesitate to send him to prison for violation of probation if Miller became &quot; significantly involved &quot; in any crime . &quot; You will be carrying the key to the penitentiary around in your pocket , young_man , &quot; Mills said . Miller ' s probation had been scheduled to end in early 1995 . Seville Colston , who with her husband Greg raised Miller for much of his childhood , expressed surprise at the arrest , describing Miller as &quot; a troubled little kid with problems , but he wasn ' t real bad. &quot; A talented artist who recently had shown some of his drawings to the Walt Disney studios , Miller tended to be shy and to hide his feelings , Colston said . &quot; He always made light of things , &quot; she said . &quot; that ' s why it ' s shocking to me that he even had a 9-millimeter whatever it was . I ' ve never known him to play with guns . I ' ve never known that side of him. &quot; Greg Colston , who runs an auto repair_shop at 69th Street and Vermont Avenue , said Miller had been spending much of his time there , visiting . Greg Colston said he learned of the arrest late Friday and theorized that Miller may have been the target of others who wanted to do him harm in some way . &quot; I can ' t believe it -- I can ' t believe it , &quot; Greg Colston said . &quot; He comes_by my shop all_the time . I ' ve been trying to keep him in the right direction . I don ' t believe this ( stuff ) that happened. &quot; Miller ' s attorney in the Denny case , James R . Gillen , could not be reached for comment . In videotapes of the Denny beating in 1992 , Miller was seen opening the door of Denny ' s truck before Denny was pulled from it and severely beaten . However , lawyers from both sides agreed that Miller committed no acts of violence against Denny . The videotapes also showed Miller going_through Denny ' s pockets later , as he lay on the ground . &quot; I never in my life beat on nobody , &quot; Miller said after his arrest . He ultimately pleaded guilty to felony assault with a deadly weapon for throwing a metal-encased telephone_book at the car in which Marisa Bejar was riding at Florence and Normandie , opening a gash in her head and showering her 7-month-old baby with glass . The two misdemeanor charges involved receiving a stolen purse and taking papers from Denny ' s truck . After Miller ' s arrest Friday , one activist -- a block-club captain in a Neighborhood Watch program near Florence and Normandie -- polled others in her group on the alleged incident . No one seemed surprised by it , the activist said , declining to be named for fear of repercussions . &quot; We have got_to do something to get these types of people off the street -- ( the ones ) that are going_to be running_for their guns and wiping_out people , &quot; the block club captain said . &quot; It makes life so cheap. &quot;</TEXT>
