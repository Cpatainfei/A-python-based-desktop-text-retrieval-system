   <HEADLINE> CAPITAL POWER STRUGGLE ; DON ' T BEMOAN GRIDLOCK -- THE CONSTITUTION LIKES IT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As we prepare_for the convening of a new Congress , we ought to be clear about what we can expect . The defeat of health-care reform and the passage of the crime bill in the last Congress are widely misunderstood , in part because Democrats and Republicans are making partisan claims but in larger part because Americans do not understand what they can and cannot expect from their national government . To liberal Democrats , Bill_Clinton ' s health-care plan was defeated because of political-action committee spending , Republican obstructionism , special-interest pressure and misleading television advertising . To conservative Republicans , the crime bill was passed because it was laden with &quot; pork. &quot; The fate of high-profile political issues cannot solely be explained by personal failings , narrow partisanship or devious maneuvering . These forces are always at_work , of course , and sometimes make a big difference , but whenever this country comes_to grips with a major controversy , the way it is resolved usually depends more on the central features of the U.S. constitutional system than on the tactics of the participants . These features are : * The system of checks and balances requires the creation of a majority coalition out of disparate , often antagonistic elements if any significant policy is to be adopted . * In assembling such a coalition , the benefits of a program must appear to be real and the costs either small , deferred or displaced onto the &quot; other guy. &quot; * If there is strong public demand for some specific federal action , coalitions can be formed out of the sheer pressure of electoral necessity ; but if there is no such clear demand , members must receive side payments in exchange for joining the coalition . * Despite the aggrandizement of federal power during the last_half century , the Constitution and the political culture require that many policies be implemented by state and local authorities . Applied to health_care , these principles have the following implications : A new policy initiative of the magnitude of Clinton ' s health plan requires either a crisis or strong popular support if it is to pass . The plan must convince people that its benefits exceed its costs or that its costs will be paid by somebody else . The support of groups already delivering the service must be assured by making them part of the process and plan , or their opposition must be made ineffectual by isolating and demonizing them . The Clinton health plan did not address some of these requirements and tried but failed to meet others . There was no popularly sensed &quot; health-care crisis. &quot; There was popular concern over rising health-care costs , but little demand for changing the ways in which the health-care needs of uninsured people are being met . The public thought the President gave an effective health-care speech to Congress , but few believed they were the people he was talking_about . Groups now delivering health_care -- doctors , hospitals , insurance and pharmaceutical companies -- were largely frozen_out of policy development . Many large corporations like the idea of the government taking_over some of their post-retirement health costs , but they were outnumbered by the small firms that resisted taking_on new costs . The public would n ' t mind seeing uninsured people receive care and their own coverage guaranteed , but they will only support these things if someone else pays . Clinton tried to persuade them that the &quot; someone else &quot; were greedy insurance and pharmaceutical companies and wasteful paper-shufflers , but his effort to demonize these groups failed . Had the United States a parliamentary system , everything would have been different . In all likelihood , we would have long since had a single-payer system like Canada ' s or some version of the German plan . But the U.S. Constitution does not permit us to move decisively in such directions without a crisis ; it permits us , at best , to modify the existing system , correct the worst and most widely recognized problems and devise new ways of having public-private partnerships that take_into_account diverse local realities . So stop complaining about Harry and Louise ads , PAC spending and congressional gridlock . Crime is a different story . There was , and is , in the public mind a genuine crisis , so some action is politically imperative . The problem is that neither the Constitution nor public_opinion permits the federal_government to do much except make symbolic gestures ( the federal death_penalty ) and ship_money to the states ( to pay part of the costs of a_few police_officers , build some prisons and try some untested programs ) . And even to do these things , Washington must promise to help every congressional_district and not just those with a severe crime problem . The recently announced allocation of federally subsidized police_officers to the cities illustrates what this means -- such crime hot spots as Stanislaus , Calif. , St . Albans , Vt. , and Rock Springs , Wyo. , will get some &quot; tree &quot; cops . In a parliamentary regime with political authority centralized in a national government , things would have been different . There would long since have been a national police_force ( or , as in England , a nationally funded and directed set of local police_forces ) enforcing a national criminal code . If the death_penalty existed , it would be based on national law applicable to all offenders . There would probably still be a Bill of Rights of some sort , but there would be no strong , independent judiciary to enforce it against the legislative_branch . Because parliamentary systems are more responsive to national elites than to local interests , penal policy would reflect , in large measure , the views of these elites ( in much of Europe of late , those views have favored decarceration and rehabilitation ) . Would such a nationalized criminal-justice system produce less crime ? Not if the recent experience of England , Germany and Sweden is any guide . National elites influenced our crime bill as well , though not nearly to the same degree as would be the case abroad . The price of a largely meaningless expansion of the federal death_penalty -- and even more meaningless federal &quot; three strikes &quot; law -- was the insertion of several billion dollars for untested social spending . Critics called this &quot; pork , &quot; as if that were a serious criticism . But buying_off potential coalition members with spending programs they favor is exactly what the Founders not only expected , but practiced . In 1790 , Alexander Hamilton got his economic plan adopted in exchange for locating the capital district on the banks of the Potomac , as Thomas_Jefferson wanted . Washington , D.C. , was -- literally -- built_on &quot; pork. &quot; What is significant about pork today is not that it is less savory or more common , but that it has changed . Once pork meant tangible benefits to particular districts ( such_as a grant for Lamar College in the Texas congressional_district of Rep . Jack Brooks ) ; today , it increasingly means general rules and programs to satisfy nationally organized constituencies ( such_as programs that somebody believes prevent crime ) . Many liberals and conservatives would like this country to have health and crime policies that are more &quot; rational &quot; -- that is , systematically planned , carefully coordinated and centrally directed . Unless they want to scrap the Constitution , they should forget it . And a good thing , too ; however messy , localistic and &quot; irrational &quot; our policies in these areas , they are likely to permit far greater levels of innovation and to be more easily subject_to corrections in the light of experience than the &quot; rational &quot; policies abroad. *</TEXT>
