   <HEADLINE> ENERGY SUPPLIER MAKES OFFER FOR COMPETITOR MAGMA POWER ; ENERGY : IF THE $ 840-MILLION OFFER IS ACCEPTED , THE DEAL WOULD MERGE THE NATION ' S TWO LARGEST GEOTHERMAL PRODUCERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a bid to buy one of its major competitors , California Energy Co . made an unsolicited $ 840-million tender_offer Monday for San Diego-based Magma Power Co . -- a deal that would merge the nation ' s two largest independent geothermal energy producers . California Energy offered $ 35 a share for each of Magma Power ' s 24 million outstanding common shares , consisting_of $ 25 in cash and $ 10 in California Energy common_stock . Wallace Dieckmann , chief financial_officer for Magma Power , said he could not comment on the offer because his company had not yet received the California Energy proposal . Magma Power has 350 employees , of whom 35 work_at the company ' s headquarters in San Diego and the remainder at power_plants in the Imperial Valley . Trading in both companies ' stock was halted late Monday pending news of the acquisition offer . California Energy shares were unchanged at $ 17 on the New York Stock_Exchange , while Magma Power shares were down $ .75 at $ 27.50 in over-the-counter trading . California Energy , based in Omaha , spelled_out its tender_offer in a letter Monday from its chairman , David Sokol , to Magma Power ' s chief_executive and board of directors . Sokol said the companies have discussed a business combination on several occasions and that he hoped the transaction could be completed on a friendly basis . But he warned that his company was prepared to go directly to Magma ' s shareholders with a tender_offer . California Energy has more_than $ 300 million cash on_hand , Sokol said , and should have no difficulty acquiring additional financing for the acquisition . &quot; We are , of course , prepared to negotiate in good_faith all aspects of our proposal and to work_out the terms in a mutually satisfactory merger_agreement , containing terms and conditions typical for a transaction of this type , &quot; Sokol said in his letter . A Wall_Street energy analyst who asked not to be identified said both companies are competing in the booming geothermal markets in the Far East . A merger might cut costs and reduce competition for California Energy , he said . Both companies are looking_to the Philippines and Indonesia for future growth . Magma Power recently signed a deal to operate a 216-megawatt plant on the Philippine island of Leyte to be completed in 1997 pending financing arrangements . California Energy has deals to build plants totaling 300 megawatts in the Philippines . &quot; The two of us used to compete in the domestic U.S. market for power generation , &quot; Sokol said . &quot; The market has shifted very dramatically in the last year to where our primary growth prospects are international . It is a very different marketplace . Magma Power operates seven geothermal plants in Imperial Valley that generate 244 megawatts of power . Last year , the company reported profits of $ 52.1 million on revenue of $ 167 million . It sells all_of its energy to Southern California Edison . Magma Power is 21 % owned by Dow Chemical , whose engineers developed the technology that harnessed the Imperial Valley ' s superheated brines -- fluids thick_with dissolved solids that circulate below ground at temperatures of up_to 550 degrees . Magma also owns or leases about 200 # 000 acres for possible future geothermal development . Magma Power ' s management in recent years has been dominated by ex-Dow Chemical executives . California Energy operates six geothermal plants that generate 300 megawatts of power , all but one of which are located in the Coso geothermal field near Mammoth Lakes . The company reported a profit of $ 42.5 million on revenue of $ 132 million last fiscal_year . One of the company ' s major shareholders is the Kiewit family , owners of an Omaha-based construction firm , Peter Kiewit Sons .</TEXT>
