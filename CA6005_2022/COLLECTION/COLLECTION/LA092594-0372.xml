   <HEADLINE> MAKING HIS MARK ; HANDWRITING_EXPERT IS INCREASINGLY USED TO HELP IDENTIFY GRAFFITI VANDALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> James ( Jay ) Black is the taggers ' unseen enemy . Little do they know that the shy man in jeans and Nike running_shoes could one day take_the_stand against them and put them away , without ever having met them . Black , 47 , is a forensic scientist whose work the past dozen years has involved forgeries and fraud . But as a handwriting-analysis expert , he finds himself increasingly used in prosecuting graffiti vandals , otherwise known as taggers . He recently testified in two trials in Orange County , including one in which Kaya , one of the region ' s most infamous juvenile taggers , was convicted and given a three-month sentence . Black now is employed by six law_enforcement agencies in Orange County , three in San Bernardino County and , increasingly , by others around the country . He recently was asked to testify in Massachusetts . During the past two years , he has worked primarily for the Orange Police_Department in 36 cases involving graffiti , or as Black calls it , &quot; visual terrorism , constituting both a property crime and a social crime. &quot; &quot; Jay is a recognized , court-tested examiner of ' questioned documents , ' or to paraphrase , he ' s a handwriting_expert , &quot; said Orange Police Detective Jack Nanigian , who works closely with Black . &quot; Our agency had used him for years on forgeries and written-document fraud cases . &quot; Then , about two years ago , when graffiti vandalism -- especially tagging -- exploded , Jay conceived_of the idea of using his skills in handwriting analysis to identify the authors of graffiti vandalism. &quot; Black has proven consistently , Nanigian said , that the characteristics of handwriting are the same &quot; for a questioned document as they are for spray-painted vandalism on walls. &quot; Nanigian routinely provides Black with schoolbook covers , folders , lunch boxes , backpacks , practice pads , tennis_shoes , hats -- items used by suspected taggers to scrawl their monikers . It is primarily the tagger ' s moniker that opens the door for Black . &quot; The spelling ( of the moniker ) is one of the first things , &quot; Nanigian said . &quot; The shape of the letters , the proportionality , the frequency of it being written in various locations . . . . If it appears similar to that of other writing samples , Jay can usually establish a connection. &quot; In the case of Kaya , a 17-year-old high_school dropout suspected in numerous acts of graffiti vandalism , Black was able to show that in 45 out of 100 locations , &quot; the author was ( Kaya ) , &quot; Nanigian said . Kaya ' s work appeared on freeway signs , buildings and signal_boxes and often was etched in glass throughout central Orange County , Nanigian said . He even was suspected of leaving his moniker outside the Federal Building in Santa Ana and on a sign along the Costa Mesa Freeway . Black ' s skill at linking Kaya to as_many as 45 incidents propelled the amount of damage to more_than $ 5 # 000 -- meaning he could be prosecuted for a felony and not just a misdemeanor , a critical factor_in such cases . &quot; There ' s only four ways to nail a tagger , &quot; Nanigian said . &quot; You ' ve got_to see ' em do_it , somebody else has to see ' em do_it , the guilty party confesses , or you have a scientific handwriting analysis done to pin it down to a single suspect . . . . We don ' t get too many of the first three , which is the reason Jay ' s so valuable. &quot; Photographs are Black ' s best pieces of evidence . But on occasion , he checks_out the markings himself . On a recent muggy morning , he walked stealthily along a gravel-rutted road under an overpass , making his way past wary transients amid a clutter of broken glass and stolen shopping_carts to eye every available surface . He found plenty of graffiti and several spent cans of Krylon spray paint , including one with a bullet_hole straight through it . &quot; This was put_up by gangs , &quot; he said , pointing to undistinguished markings that read &quot; dark side &quot; -- the name of a local gang . More scrawlings under the same bridge were the work of taggers , Black said , explaining that what the public knows about graffiti is oddly limited , considering the millions of dollars in damage it inflicts on property , both public and private , and the level of attention it commands from law_enforcement . Graffiti vandalism now costs county agencies more_than $ 4 million a year , including , officials say , more_than $ 1 million a year in Santa Ana alone . Taggers , Black said , tend to be nonviolent and not affiliated with gangs , whereas the public assumes that most , if not all , graffiti is the work of gun-toting gang members . If graffiti is evident , Black said , the public frequently -- and mistakenly -- concludes that gangs are taking_over the neighborhood . Another misconception : that graffiti is the province of the underclass . &quot; Some of the worst tagging is going_on in affluent areas of Irvine by affluent kids who live_in Irvine , &quot; Black said . The father of three children who lives_in a bucolic area of Lake Forest , Black finds himself cast in an unlikely role : He ' s suddenly well versed in the culture known as hip-hop . &quot; Hip-hop or tagger graffiti is far more artistic than gang graffiti , which I don ' t work with very often , &quot; he said . &quot; Members of the hip-hop culture , which began in New York in the 1970s and spread west , subscribe_to rap_music and break-dancing and love to spray-paint graffiti , usually in places more visible than this. &quot; Fame , artistic expression , power and rebellion are the major motivators of the hip-hop culture , he said , and fame is determined by the quantity and quality of a tagger ' s work . Why do they do_it ? &quot; For peer approval and the thrill of it , &quot; Black said . Hip-hop painters usually are males in their teens or early 20s , but , he said , &quot; females and older individuals have been known to write it. &quot; Hip-hop increasingly is prevalent in Orange County , as are its symbols , Black said : baggy pants , shorts and shirts ; stocking and baseball_caps ; long belts , oversize ( often untied ) high-top tennis_shoes and backpacks . Black most enjoys the work for &quot; helping to establish out of a murky situation what the truth really is. &quot; But the work isn ' t easy . &quot; The process itself is very labor intensive , both for the police and for me , because it takes a lot of time for police to keep track of everything and a lot of time to do the procedures , &quot; he said . A guarded man who describes himself as bland , Black said he &quot; rarely gets excited about anything , &quot; whether it ' s triumphs or setbacks . &quot; But it ' s real disappointing to police_officers , &quot; he said , &quot; to put_in hours and hours of work and have something come_back inconclusive or equivocal , because I didn ' t have enough to ID somebody . &quot; When I can ' t prove it , or nobody can prove it , it ' s real frustrating , especially if a lot of time and effort has gone_into the preparation. &quot;</TEXT>
