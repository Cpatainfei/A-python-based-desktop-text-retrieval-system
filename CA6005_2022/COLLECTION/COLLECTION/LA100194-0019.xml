   <HEADLINE> U.S. ABSTAINS AS U.N. VOTES TO EXTEND SOMALIA MISSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States , insisting that &quot; the time has come_to bring this U.N. mission to a conclusion , &quot; took the unusual step of abstaining Friday when the Security_Council extended the peacekeeping operation in Somalia for another month . The American stand put the United States at_odds with the 14 other members of the council , all_of whom voted for the resolution that delays a decision on withdrawal . Since the United States has a veto , it could have halted the mission immediately . But the Americans clearly did not want to defy the overwhelming majority and end the mission so suddenly . &quot; In the face of Somali intransigence , and unwillingness to reach political agreement , ( the U.N. ) cannot continue to maintain 15 # 000 troops in Somalia and spend over $ 2.5 million a day , &quot; U.S. Ambassador Madeleine K . Albright told the Security_Council . &quot; The resolution . . . fails to come_to grips with the realities of the situation in Somalia , &quot; she said . &quot; It puts_off any decision . . . for yet another month . . . . The gravity of the situation . . . does not countenance such delay. &quot; But French Ambassador Jean-Bertrand Merimee , clearly reflecting the view of the overwhelming majority , said : &quot; It would be a serious mistake for the Security_Council to terminate the force prematurely . . . . The U.N. should continue to play a role in Somalia. &quot; The U.S. stance meant that the country that led the world into a chaotic Somalia with more_than 28 # 000 troops in December , 1992 , was now trying to lead the world out of a chaotic Somalia as soon as possible . None of the peacekeepers now in Somalia are American . The council , although it passed the resolution , did not give the mission any resounding accolade . The resolution clearly lays the groundwork for a possible withdrawal if security continues to deteriorate and Somalia ' s antagonistic warlords fail to resolve their differences in a conference . While extending the mission until Oct . 31 , the resolution provides that the Security_Council will use that time to &quot; undertake a thorough examination &quot; of the mission &quot; with a view to deciding on its future. &quot; In addition , the resolution asks Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to prepare contingency plans for withdrawal . Many diplomats believe the 15 # 000 peacekeepers could be in danger if they depart without some kind of reinforced military escort . Albright appeared to imply that U.S. forces might take_part in this when she told the council : &quot; My government stands ready to work with other members of the council to bring_about &quot; a safe withdrawal .</TEXT>
