   <TEXT> Richard Nixon wove many_a tangled web in his lengthy and controversial career . One of his unintended legacies has the National Archives in the uncomfortable position of keeping research material secret . It ' s a federal agency that should be dedicated to preserving the nation ' s history for the public . The centerpiece of a dispute between the National Archives and Nixon ' s alma_mater , Whittier College , is the availability of audiotapes . After Nixon became President in 1969 , Whittier was chosen as the site of his presidential library . A Whittier professor interviewed relatives , friends and neighbors concerning the years 1913 to 1946 ( a period ending just before the start of his political career ) for an oral history . A foundation was established to raise funds for the library but found the task impossible after Nixon resigned the presidency in disgrace due_to the Watergate scandal , in which an entirely different set of tapes played a key role . As the foundation folded , it deeded the tapes to some future Nixon presidential library , and the National Archives took them for safekeeping . They now reside in the archives ' branch in the Orange County community of Laguna Niguel . Much other Nixon material there has been available to the public , but not the Whittier tapes . Although the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace opened in Yorba Linda four years ago , the National Archives contended that it was not a real presidential library because it did not control the presidential papers and was not administered by the archives . Whittier College contends the tapes should be made public . At the very least , the Nixon library should have copies provided by the archives . As Stephen Ambrose ' s masterful three-volume biography of Nixon demonstrated , historians have no dearth of materials on the man , before , during and after his presidency . Yet every bit helps . Insights and remembrances from those who knew him form parts of the mosaic of history . At Nixon ' s funeral in Yorba Linda last April , President Clinton urged that his predecessor be judged on &quot; his entire life and career. &quot; The National Archives should help historians in furthering that worthy goal .</TEXT>
