   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; YOUNG U.S. TEAM LOOKING FOR GOLD ; HOCKEY : THOUGH SEEDED SIXTH , THE AMERICANS ARE CONFIDENT . QUEST BEGINS TODAY AGAINST FRANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Its exuberance tempered but not extinguished by six months and 61 games of preparation , the U.S. Olympic hockey_team begins its gold-medal mission today against France . &quot; This is something I ' ve been dreaming about since I was 8 years old , &quot; said Craig Johnson , the left_wing for Todd Marchant and Peter Ferraro on the team ' s top-scoring line . &quot; I think we ' re really prepared , and we have some real confidence going in. &quot; Although no U.S. team has won the Olympics in a foreign country -- the 1960 team won at Squaw Valley , Calif. , and the stunning 1980 victory was accomplished at Lake Placid , N.Y. -- there is reason for U.S. high hopes . &quot; I strongly believe we have a chance for a medal , and I ' m not just speaking hopefully , &quot; said center Peter Ciavaglia , who joined the team 10 days ago after playing in the Swedish Elite League . &quot; We ' re shooting for gold . I can ' t say that if we won a bronze we ' d be unhappy , but right now we would n ' t trade a guaranteed bronze for the chance we have. &quot; The U.S. team is seeded sixth in the 12-team field , well above the 10th-seeded French team . However , the United States and France played a 4-4 tie on Feb . 5 in Rouen , France , a game in which the United States squandered a 3-1 lead . Too_little discipline by the U.S. team , and it will struggle as it did_in Rouen , where only a late goal by Peter Ferraro averted an embarrassing defeat . Too many mistakes by goaltender Mike Dunham , who has stopped 64 of 68 shots in his last two games after giving_up 35 goals in a five-game stretch , and the offense will be under pressure . Too_much offensive pressure , and the defense , the team ' s most vulnerable element , will be thrown_off . &quot; The first five minutes of the first game of the entire Olympics , with a young team like we have , this one game could be the catalyst to send us toward a medal , &quot; Ciavaglia said . &quot; People are going_to have question_marks about us after that . We learned we can ' t lose our patience against teams like Sweden and France . If we have to chip it off the boards , dump it in , we will . We ' ve been burnt before and gotten frustrated , and we can ' t let that happen again . We ' ve got_to keep attacking , but be smart and not force the attack. &quot; Coach Tim Taylor is concerned about his team maintaining its concentration if it has a slow start or is victimized by an unfortunate bounce . &quot; Our players are young , &quot; he said . &quot; We can ' t change that . We can only make them play more maturely and with as much poise as possible . Discipline is the area we ' ve made the most progress in and it ' s the area we have the longest to go . These kids were all like street_fighters when we started . They ' ve got_to be patient and not take retaliatory penalties , but stand_up and support each other . &quot; The essence of our game_plan is to not get frustrated with their defensive play . You have to get good goaltending , and you have to be patient defensively . It ' s not a situation where you can count_on offense to win. &quot; Taylor juggled his line combinations through last Wednesday ' s pre-Olympic finale . The offense will be sparked by the Marchant line and the line of late arrivals Ciavaglia and Ted Drury ( Calgary Flames ) flanking center Brian Rolston . &quot; We ' re at a point where we feel we have four very solid lines , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; I think that ' s our best approach -- four lines with short and hard shifts. &quot; That and solid goaltending . Dunham , who admitted he had never felt so discouraged as he did during his slump , has regained the assurance that deserted him in December and January . &quot; I lost some sleep , but right now I ' m ready to go , &quot; he said . &quot; ( Today ' s game ) is just another hockey_game , and I ' m going_to have a lot of other big hockey_games in my career after this . . . . We ' ve played so many games , we know each other ' s ins and outs . There ' s no question we ' re ready and we ' re confident with each other. &quot;</TEXT>
