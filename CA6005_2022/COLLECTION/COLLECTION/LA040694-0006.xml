   <TEXT> The American self-image of ethical uprightness in the face of Nazi terror during World_War_II has remained an unexamined myth of the national life . But the myth is broken , if not shattered , by Martin Ostrow ' s devastating 90-minute film for PBS ' &quot; The American Experience , &quot; &quot; America and the Holocaust : Deceit and Indifference. &quot; With a mass of paperwork and eyewitness testimony to back it up , Ostrow ' s work explains how the U.S._government deliberately prevented the immigration of millions of Jews trying to flee Nazi-occupied Europe . And the blame falls right into the lap of President Franklin D . Roosevelt . Yet Ostrow ' s superbly constructed history , lucidly narrated by Hal Linden and based largely on scholar David S . Wyman ' s decades-long research , is not merely a critique of U.S. war-era policy . It reveals an America shot through_with deep anti-Semitic sentiments , and recounts the tragic tale of Jewish refugee Kurt Klein ' s family . As Klein ' s running narrative is intercut with the political scandal in the halls of Washington , &quot; America and the Holocaust &quot; sharply demonstrates how bureaucratic decisions carry personal and moral consequences . Unlike the racist virulence of the Nazis , a quieter racism dominated such agencies as the State_Department , according to Wyman , who points a particular finger at Assistant Secretary_of_State Breckinridge Long . Roosevelt appointee Long enacted a secret policy to , in Long ' s words , &quot; postpone and postpone and postpone &quot; visas for Jews seeking refuge in the United States . The motives of Long and his cronies could do with more examination by both Ostrow and Wyman ; alongside anti-Semitism were the political pressures of hundreds of anti-foreign , anti-immigrant &quot; patriotic societies , &quot; isolationism , the security concern that German spies would enter the United States and the State_Department ' s concern not to upset relations with oil-rich Arab nations . * Klein recalls the unendurable wait as he and his brothers and sisters , freshly arrived in the new country , anticipated word from their parents that their visas were in_order for emigration . To his growing horror , he realized that German extermination plans were being aided and abetted by both British and American policymakers unwilling to ease visa requirements . The young Klein was David against the U.S. governmental Goliath , but , as news arrived in 1942 that German trains were carrying thousands of Jews to death camps , a campaign for American rescue of Jews gained real clout . Its stars included such unlikely allies as Rep . Will Rogers Jr. , writer Ben Hecht and Dr. Stephen S . Wise , but it was Treasury_Secretary Henry Morgenthau and his aides who finally uncovered Long ' s secret policy . The horrors didn ' t end there . Ostrow ' s film describes how the War_Department declined to consider bombing the Auschwitz death camp because it was too far a flight , even though several photos show U.S. bombers flying directly over the camp to bomb nearby oil factories . Klein ' s story finally ends with a mixture of bittersweetness and tragedy that ranks with the most moving chapters in Holocaust history .</TEXT>
