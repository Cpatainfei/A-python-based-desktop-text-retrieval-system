   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : MISSION VIEJO ; DRIVE IS_ON TO NAME STADIUM AFTER COACH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Parents and students at Mission Viejo High_School are calling_on trustees of the Saddleback Valley Unified School District to name the campus stadium in honor of deceased former football_coach and teacher Mike Rush . Rush died of a heart_attack in November at age 46 . Eight months earlier , he resigned his coaching position amid controversy over the school ' s devil mascot and reports of conflict between him and Principal Robert Metz . In five seasons , Rush ' s teams compiled a 45-16 record . He had also been an assistant football_coach at the school for 10 years . After stepping_down as head coach , Rush continued teaching at Mission Viejo and was hired as an assistant football_coach at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana . &quot; Mike Rush was a hero in this community ; he touched thousands of lives , &quot; said Sandie Gonzales , one of the parents spearheading the stadium drive . &quot; Mike stood_for integrity , honesty , moral values , all_the things that are so important to young people . What better way to pass Mike ' s values along to the community and keep his values alive than to put his name on that stadium ? &quot; Rush ' s departure from the district came amid controversy over the school ' s logo . Rush had sided with players and students who rebelled against a ban on the school ' s devil logo , put_in place in 1986 as a result of concerns from the Christian community . Rush ' s position caused tensions between him and school officials , but no one was ever willing to discuss publicly the reasons for his resignation as football_coach . Before Rush ' s death , Gonzales and other parents petitioned the district ' s Board_of_Education for his reinstatement . They also filed a lawsuit against the district last year , claiming it infringed on their children ' s free-speech rights by forbidding them to wear in school the_devil icon , representing the school ' s Diablos nickname . Diablo is Spanish for devil . The district later rescinded the ban and last September held an election in which students voted to adopt a baby-faced devil as the new mascot , replacing a bulldog . However , the new logo is in limbo because it may look too_much like a trademarked comic-book character . Last week , about 60 people -- including parents , students , Rush ' s widow and a Capistrano Valley High_School football_coach whose players competed against Rush ' s teams -- attended a trustees meeting to ask that the field on the Mission Viejo High campus be named Mike Rush Memorial Stadium . The field does not have a name . About a third of those in_attendance delivered occasionally emotional speeches testifying to Rush ' s charisma , caring , interest in students and motivational abilities . They also presented the board with a petition with 1 # 500 signatures from students and community members . &quot; Mike was never one to brag about himself or carry_on about his accomplishments , &quot; said Pam Rush , his widow . &quot; It ' s something I don ' t think the board can deny after the number and variety of people who got_up to speak on his behalf. &quot; Board President Dore J . Gilbert said the board is concerned about setting a precedent by putting the name of a high_school football_coach on the stadium . It will be seeking reaction from parents and students throughout the district , particularly Laguna Hills High , which shares the stadium with Mission Viejo . The board is scheduled to discuss the issue again on Jan . 25 . &quot; The Board_of_Education is not making a decision based on how we as individuals may feel about Mike Rush , &quot; Gilbert said . &quot; We are making a decision based on what is right for the district. &quot; RICHARD CORE</TEXT>
