   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : EAST : LINCOLN HEIGHTS ; THE CHALLENGE BEGINS FOR ACCIDENT VICTIM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cindy Gonzales sits on her bed with her twin , Sandra , going_over math problems that the high_school freshman learned long ago . They review the work , along with reading and spelling , because 14-year-old Cindy , who had been making A ' s and Bs , now tests at a third-grade level in math and at a sixth-grade level in reading after she was struck by a drunk driver Nov . 29 . She does not remember the accident , but can relay what happened from what police , friends and family tell her . The former Lincoln High_School student is preparing to enter Eagle Rock High_School in February to catch_up_with her schoolwork . Meanwhile , her mother , Beatrice , 49 , is gathering signatures to petition the city to put a traffic_light at North Broadway and Sichel Street , where Cindy was hit . Relatives and friends have conducted fund-raisers , such_as carwashes and breakfasts , to help the family defray medical_expenses . &quot; Something bad has to be for something good ( to happen ) , and you have to turn it around to something good , &quot; Beatrice Gonzales said . &quot; I figure the only thing is I want to do something for my daughter . I want to try to stop this ( the lack of a traffic_light ) from hurting another person. &quot; Cindy and a friend , Frank Cifuentes , 16 , were crossing North Broadway in a crosswalk when they were hit by a car . Cindy was thrown 30 feet and Frank suffered a broken leg , cuts and bruises . &quot; I have half my memory , &quot; Cindy said , explaining that the car hit her on her right side , fracturing her right leg and affecting the vision in her right eye and agility in her right arm . She was in a coma for 15 days . She has short-term_memory and sometimes needs help in simple tasks , even in spelling her name . Released from Childrens Hospital last week , Cindy walks with the aid of a front-wheel walker and occasionally uses a wheelchair . The driver , John Joe Gomez , 30 , of Lincoln Heights , pleaded guilty to felony drunk driving with bodily injury Dec . 27 . Police say Gomez , who has two felony convictions for driving under the influence , drove_away from the scene but returned shortly thereafter . &quot; I think I hit something but I ' m not sure if I did . I ' m responsible , &quot; he is quoted as saying in the police report . Gomez faces three to seven years in prison when he is sentenced March 29 in Superior_Court , said police Detective Richard Lopez . &quot; They ' ll evaluate whether they think he ' s made an effort to clean his act_up or whether he ' s a menace to society , &quot; said Lopez of the Central Traffic Division . Ten years ago Cindy ' s father , Alfred , 56 , and Sandra were seriously hurt when their car was hit by a delivery_truck . The family had to sell their Chatsworth home , liquidate their furniture , move_in with Alfred Gonzales ' mother and rely_on public assistance to make ends meet . Alfred Gonzales , who made a living in real_estate , now relies_on Social_Security and a settlement from the accident to provide_for his family , who moved_into their Lincoln Heights home_in 1988 . Now , they are facing a new challenge . Cindy underwent surgery to drain excess fluid from her brain and explore for internal bleeding , and had a tracheotomy to clear her windpipe . She wears a scarf to hide short-cropped hair where doctors had to drill into her head . She wants to attend Gomez ' s sentencing . &quot; I ' m so mad , &quot; Cindy said . &quot; I ' m going_to tell him. &quot; MARY ANNE PEREZ</TEXT>
