   <HEADLINE> TESTING : PARENTAL FEEDBACK ON CLAS EXAMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I am writing to express my concern regarding the CLAS test that is currently required to be administered to fourth- , fifth- , eight- and 10th-grade students . I believe that this is an invasion_of_privacy and that it is an attempt to control and manipulate the family_unit . As an example , in the_English portion of the test , children are forced to read graphic and violent stories and then write their feelings or experiences as expressed in the story . I do not believe this is necessary and certainly should not be administered in a test at school . They are also asked to name a circumstance ( s ) that changed their feelings about a member of their family . If they cannot do so , they are asked to make one up . If the story , for example , centers_on abuse , it is reported to the proper authorities . Please understand that I am a firm believer in protecting our children from any sort of child_abuse ; however , I am against forcing a child to make_up a story ( they could have learned from a television_program or courses taught in schools ) , and the government taking whatever action they feel necessary without knowing whether or not the story is make believe or true . This is ludicrous . It is also my understanding that the CLAS test is not in any way an aptitude test . My child was administered an aptitude test recently and I have no problem with this . I think it is a helpful tool in educating our children . However , the CLAS test does not measure aptitude . In light of the above , it is my understanding that passage of the SB-1273 would : 1 . Make CLAS testing a graduating requirement ; 2 . Take_away local school control by forcing schools to administer the test ; and 3 . Make_it illegal for anyone to make unauthorized copies of the test . ( This is of concern to me . I would like the right to peruse any test or school material my child is subjected to. ) Torrance schools are known to be some of the best in the state . Our local officials and schools are obviously doing something right . I would like my school district to have the option , and the parents of the children to have the right , to refuse to administer the test . I for one will be writing a letter to my child ' s teacher , principal , and district superintendent to excuse my child from taking the CLAS test . DARLENE BESST Torrance</TEXT>
