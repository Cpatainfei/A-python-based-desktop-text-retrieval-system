   <TEXT> * Martin Walker is correct when he states that the special relationship between the United States and England is dead ( Opinion , July 17 ) . But his impression that we gave orders to the loyal British is totally false ; it was in fact the tail that was wagging the dog . Walker ' s belief that the_British were used as military cannon_fodder is a joke . Many a young Americans can testify to serving in postwar Europe to forestall a possible Soviet invasion , at a considerable cost to this nation . I have recently returned from living_in the United Kingdom , and became used to the distorted news coverage about America on television nightly . There is anger that we are not engaged in the former Yugoslavia , but the real problem is that the Europeans cannot decide what to do among themselves . The British particularly want to use American &quot; cannon_fodder &quot; on a European problem . Many British_people live_in the nostalgic past of British greatness . Those days are long gone . The future is in a united Europe , with Germany at its center . The British are the main obstacle to a peaceful , united Europe . The country is deeply divided on this issue . Britain is not the quaint country pictured in airline commercials . Britain needs to wake_up and realize its standing in the world and go from there . But I can assure Walker that Britons , not Americans , are to blame . NEIL G . FLANAGAN Costa Mesa</TEXT>
