   <HEADLINE> DOCUMENTARY ; AFRAID OF FLYING ? TRY CATCHING A RIDE ABOARD ' MAYBE AIRLINES ' TO SARAJEVO ; JUST GETTING TO THE PLANE CAN BE HUMILIATING , COMPLEX , PERILOUS -- AND SOMETIMES FUNNY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Aren ' t you afraid ? &quot; sensible people ask foreign correspondents as they set_out for besieged Sarajevo . It ' s a logical question , as this forsaken Bosnian capital has been savaged by combatants for 2 1 / 2 years , and the bombs and bullets make no distinction between the Sarajevans who are their targets and the U.N. peacekeepers , foreign_aid officials and journalists . It ' s a question that would get an unqualified affirmative answer , at least from me , if my natural instincts for survival weren ' t so thoroughly distorted by the mental and physical gymnastics required to get here in the first place . Merely getting aboard a U.N.-operated relief flight to Sarajevo has become so complicated , humiliating , perilous and unpredictable that putting that part of the trip behind me makes me feel_like I ' ve got the world beat . After being bumped a dozen times to make space for anything from leotards to lentils , finally jumping from the open tail of a C-130 cargo plane onto the Sarajevo runway in a blizzard of exhaust fumes has the same satisfying &quot; yes ! &quot; sensation as spiking a football after a touchdown . It feels_like winning the lottery , beating the odds , putting_one_over . And it even has its amusing moments . On the surface , there would seem to be little to laugh about in the United Nations ' courageous , expensive and trouble-plagued undertaking to feed hungry Sarajevans . But behind the scenes , the humanitarian airlift that has fed this rebel-encircled city since July , 1992 , operates like a black comedy crossing &quot; Catch-22 &quot; with &quot; Top Gun. &quot; The airlift is known by its pilots , ground_crews and passengers as &quot; Maybe Airlines , &quot; operating under the proud motto : &quot; Maybe We Fly , Maybe We Don ' t. &quot; You can buy &quot; Maybe Airlines &quot; T-shirts from a French canteen tucked behind a wall of sandbags at the airport . The &quot; airline &quot; brings_together by-the-book soldiers and bizarre civilians , from swaggering Tom Cruise wanna-bes who pilot the cargo planes to Ukrainian ground crewmen in plastic sandals -- even in winter . Then there ' s the explosives-sniffing dog &quot; Foster &quot; who has the entire French contingent vying for his affection . After 26 months in_service , the operation is replete with stories , from the scandalous to the absurd . There was the time a Canadian pilot bumped four senior North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization officers to make room for a Canadian television crew that planned a documentary about his brave flyboys . A German journalist for an obscure dance magazine who wanted to bring_in neon-colored tutus for a Sarajevo ballet school managed to get the Luftwaffe to up his standing to military priority with the contention he was carrying &quot; vital cargo. &quot; French flight crews have commandeered relief aircraft to fly in personal stocks of wine and pate , and Bosnian black marketeers with bogus press credentials use the airlift as a free shuttle on which to transport suitcases full of coffee , sugar , liquor and cigarettes . Journalists , who have the lowest priority among the soldiers , relief workers , missionaries , peaceniks and assorted do-gooders , often find themselves forced onto an aerial trapeze , swinging on commercial flights around southern Europe in vain efforts to get_in the right place to catch the airlift that is the sole , if unreliable , access to Sarajevo . How the white-knuckled flights come_to impart a sense of accomplishment is_best explained by the disorder and frustration that afflict each journey ' s onset . You set_out laden with guilt , as well as tons of luggage . Spouses , parents , children , even other colleagues , act like you ' re headed_off for certain death -- a prospect we correspondents try to treat as ridiculous so as_to calm our families ' fears , as well as our own . &quot; You ' re going to get stuck there forever one of these days , &quot; my husband admonished as I set_off in mid-October , well aware that the airlift had been grounded for the two previous weeks . &quot; I wish you would stop doing that , &quot; my mother said disapprovingly in a phone_call , as if going_to Sarajevo were some kind of unseemly habit , like showing_up at the dinner_table chewing gum . The logistics of getting there as safely as possible help you focus_on something other_than fear . To gain access to a U.N. relief flight , you must scurry across the Balkans to collect credentials , then obtain a helmet and flak jacket that together usually weigh more_than 20 pounds . The more experienced you get with Sarajevo ' s deprivations , the more gear you consider essential . Fears of being caught_up in an intensified siege or being marooned by a prolonged suspension of the airlift compel most of us to bring_in at least small caches of &quot; backup food &quot; : dry soup mixes , granola_bars , peanut_butter and the_like . They can always be given_away to grateful Sarajevans before departure . You want a first-aid_kit , candles , flashlights , a shortwave radio and heaps of batteries . And of course , without a laptop_computer you ' d be unable to send_back any news_stories . Even with minimal clothing and the disincentive of having to carry everything across the Sarajevo tarmac at a brisk , sniper-defying trot , keeping the load below the 66-pound limit is a challenge . The trip begins with the guessing game of choosing a venue from which to get_in . There are more flights from Ancona , Italy , than from Split , Croatia , but the latter has the attraction of being within driving distance of other locales in Bosnia-Herzegovina that you can visit if the Sarajevo airlift is grounded . For an October visit , undertaken with my Warsaw colleague , Dean E . Murphy , we gambled on getting_in from Split . The five seats allotted to passengers on each of three daily French flights are_on a first-come , first-served basis , so you have to get_up at 5 a.m. to get_to the airport by 7 , in time to jostle for space with the dozens of Priority III passengers angling for a seat . Then you wait . Sometimes you wait for the fog to lift in Sarajevo , where it seems to be foggy every day until noon . Other times you wait because the last relief planes came_back with bullet_holes , and airlift administrators want to seek fresh assurances -- insincere as they may be -- from the Bosnian combatants that they won ' t target the aircraft again . Often you wait because no one at Split or Ancona knows whether they ' re flying or not . Biding time at Split airport is an experience with the surreal . It bears a resemblance to the intergalactic bar in the movie &quot; Star Wars , &quot; with cocky pilots in their chevroned flight suits and aviator shades sipping coffee next to camouflage-clad Croatian policemen , homebound Bosnian civilians bearing slings and casts from medical treatments abroad , bearded black-marketeers skulking around in leather jackets and robed peace activists headed for the war zone to share the Bosnians ' pain . We learned , after flying from Vienna to the Croatian capital of Zagreb and then driving for 11 hours to Croatia ' s Adriatic port of Split , that flights had been suspended that Tuesday because of small-arms fire directed at the planes . The suspension lasted all day Wednesday , and fog grounded the airlift the day after that . By Friday , our fourth day of 5 a.m. reveille for nothing , we should have been immune to the vicious_cycle of hope and disappointment . The airlift was operating . The weather in Sarajevo was clear . Even some military flights that had slipped_in without passengers late Thursday had returned with reports of nothing untoward . But the_French air operations team emerged to inform our ever-growing numbers that their aircraft was being diverted to Zagreb to fly military cargoes until at least Monday . So we repacked our armor , drove_back to Zagreb and flew from there to Rome , then Ancona , where the relief flights were supposedly getting_out without problems . Somewhere en route , my bags were set_in a pool of fish brine because they emerged from the Alitalia baggage ramp with the overpowering odor of low_tide . By 7 a.m. Sunday , we were at Ancona airport , and close to 11 a.m. we were allowed to &quot; check in. &quot; This involves having your luggage weighed to make_sure it doesn ' t exceed the 30-kilogram limit . Then British Royal_Air_Force police_officers go_through it , item by item , to make_sure no one carries contraband . Your money is counted . Letters are opened . Your neatly folded shirts and underwear end_up in a tangled heap . After you repack , you sit in a small waiting_room for word that a plane is ready to take_off . There was a lot of sniffing and seat-changing as the fish odor emanated from my bags . Most people would be embarrassed , but I figured it hardly made the annals of unpleasant relief flights . I once shared the ride with a planeload of seed onions , which gagged even the unflappable cargo crew , and more_than a_few hardened passengers have lost their lunches when pilots have soared into evasive_action after being locked onto by combatants ' missiles . C-130 Hercules cargo planes are like flying submarines , with strange tubes and equipment affixed to every inch of bulkhead . Lights blink , valves hiss , steam wafts from unknown sources and the engines make a deafening roar . The seats are simple canvas slings that hang down from the bulkhead , clustered up toward the cockpit with the loading equipment and around a mounted metal container that looks_like a mailbox but bears the illuminating warning : &quot; This urinal is to be used for its intended purpose only. &quot; Ground_fire at previous relief planes can cause a flight to be called_back right up_to the moment of scheduled landing . The planes take a gut-clutching plunge from their cruising altitude down to the tarmac , to minimize the time they are visible and vulnerable to ground fire . Ours landed fairly smoothly , and we gleefully leaped_out after four pallets of flour sacks had been rolled into the sturdy arms of waiting forklifts . Finally , seven days , two 300-mile drives , four flights and much stomach acid after leaving home , we arrived in Sarajevo at 1 p.m. on a Sunday , lugging our smelly bags through the wreckage of the airport terminal . We were elated . We had made_it . We had won . At least it felt that way for the first few minutes . Trying to Fly &quot; Maybe Airlines &quot; Getting from Zagreb , Croatia , to Sarajevo , Bosnia-Herzegovina , can take six days of nerve-fraying travel . Here ' s a recent itinerary for two Times correspondents . Tuesday : Drive for 11 hours from Zagreb to Split , Croatia . U.N.-operated relief flights to Sarajevo suspended due_to small-arms fire . Wednesday : Split . Get_up at 5 a.m. Still too dangerous to fly . Thursday : Split . Get_up at 5 a.m. Fog grounds all planes . Friday : Split . Get_up at 5 a.m. All aircraft diverted to Zagreb to fly military cargoes . Drive_back to Zagreb . Saturday : Fly to Rome and then to Ancona , Italy . Sunday : Ancona . Arrive_at airport at 7 a.m. Board flight at 11 a.m. Arrive in Sarajevo at 1 p.m .</TEXT>
