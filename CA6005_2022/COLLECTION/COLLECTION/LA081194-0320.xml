   <HEADLINE> ALZHEIMER ' S ASSN . SEEKS TO EXPAND ITS VOLUNTEER BASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Responding to a heightened demand for services , the Alzheimer ' s Assn . of Orange County is attempting to double its volunteer base , according to Kim Robinson , the nonprofit agency ' s program director . &quot; We have a very small staff , so we are totally reliant_on our wonderful corps of volunteers , &quot; Robinson said . &quot; We have about 300 volunteers , which sounds like a lot , but we could easily use twice as many. &quot; An estimated 40 # 000 Alzheimer ' s patients live_in Orange County , she said . One of the most pressing needs is for workers to operate a phone information service at the agency ' s headquarters . This free service provides information about the disease and resources available to patients and their families . In addition , teams of volunteers are needed to make home visits that help &quot; reduce the isolation &quot; often experienced by Alzheimer ' s patients and their care-givers , Robinson said . Volunteers are also needed to conduct support groups for care-givers throughout the county . Modern medical technology is allowing people to live longer , Robinson said , but this also increases the risk of becoming afflicted with an age-related disease such_as Alzheimer ' s . Alzheimer ' s is the fourth-leading cause of death among older adults , Robinson said . The ailment strikes 10 % of people 65 and older and 47 % older than 85 . &quot; There is more quantity of life but not always a quality_of_life , &quot; Robinson said . Although Alzheimer ' s is primarily associated with senior_citizens , &quot; we ' re also seeing young patients , &quot; Robinson said . &quot; I ' ve heard of patients in their 30s , and some of those patients have_young children. &quot; &quot; We don ' t know what causes Alzheimer ' s , so we don ' t have a cure for it , &quot; she said . &quot; But we have discovered ways to manage it better. &quot; In the final stage of the disease , &quot; the person is totally helpless , &quot; Robinson said , which can place an extreme burden on family members and other care-givers . &quot; There is very little government support , &quot; she said . &quot; It is devastating not only emotionally but financially. &quot; The next training session for new volunteers is scheduled for 1 to 3 p.m. Aug . 26 at the agency ' s headquarters , 2540 N . Santiago Blvd. , in Orange . Information : ( 714 ) 283-1111 . ALAN EYERLY</TEXT>
