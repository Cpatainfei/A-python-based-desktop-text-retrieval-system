   <HEADLINE> UKRAINE DISARMAMENT DEAL MET WITH A NOTE OF DISDAIN ; WEAPONS : HISTORIC AGREEMENT IS OVERSHADOWED BY NATIONALIST SENSITIVITY . SOME SAY CLINTON WAS CONDESCENDING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even before President Leonid Kravchuk signed a historic agreement with the United States and Russia on Friday to give_up all_of Ukraine ' s nuclear_weapons , the headlines here were scornful . On the morning of the signing ceremony in Moscow , three of Kiev ' s leading newspapers reported not on the details of the groundbreaking trilateral accord but on what some Ukrainians considered to be condescending behavior by President Clinton during his two-hour visit to Kiev late Wednesday . Clinton kept Kravchuk waiting_on the tarmac of Boryspil Airport in freezing temperatures for at least 12 minutes before descending from Air_Force One . The visit ended , the Kiev Vedemosti newspaper said , &quot; with the absolutely tactless joke by Clinton that ' If he did not have such an important job , I would invite President Kravchuk to the United States to run my press conferences. ' &quot; The joke was clearly intended to laud Kravchuk ' s skill in handling the fierce White_House press corps . But to some Ukrainians , it sounded as though Clinton fancied Kravchuk his lackey . Kiev Vedemosti said the meeting was meant &quot; to put Ukraine in its place , &quot; and two other newspapers trumpeted Clinton ' s remark in Page One headlines . Though the flap will pass , it shows how dicey it will be for Kravchuk to sell his balky Parliament and nervous public on a disarmament deal -- even one that the White_House has bent over backward to make palatable . Clinton praised Kravchuk ' s &quot; courage and vision &quot; in agreeing to dismantle Ukraine ' s 1 # 800 nuclear_warheads in exchange for fuel , economic aid and security guarantees . But many lawmakers still view with suspicion the U.S.-sponsored initiative to denuclearize their nation . Ukrainian nationalists are still fuming over the so-called &quot; Chicken_Kiev &quot; speech by former President George_Bush here in 1991 . Bush argued that Ukraine should drop its bid for independence and remain part of a newly democratic Soviet_Union . Clinton and his aides have been careful to avoid any suggestion that the United States views Ukraine -- a country larger than France -- as a junior political partner . The United States is offering at least $ 155 million in economic aid . Equally important are security guarantees that Kravchuk can present to Ukrainians anxious that a Russia led by neo-fascist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky might try to seize the Crimean peninsula from a disarmed Ukraine . The trilateral statement says that Clinton , Kravchuk and Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin &quot; reiterated that they will deal with one another as full and equal partners and that relations among their countries must be conducted on the basis of respect for the independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity of each nation. &quot; Kravchuk underlined the &quot; inviolability &quot; of Ukraine ' s borders in remarks later Friday . Saying that nationalism &quot; always tends to spill_over the boundaries of any single state , &quot; Kravchuk warned that if Zhirinovsky prevails in Russia , Ukraine will not be the only victim . The agreement does not bind the United States or Russia to intervene if Ukraine is attacked . An attachment to the statement signed Friday says that Ukraine will eliminate all nuclear_weapons on its territory within seven years . But Ukraine will deactivate the SS-24 missiles , the most powerful in the Ukrainian arsenal , within 10 months . The attachment , whose contents had not previously been made public , states that within 10 months , Russia must give Ukraine 100 tons of uranium fuel for use in nuclear_power plants , and Ukraine must send Russia at least 200 nuclear_warheads from SS-19 and SS-24 missiles for dismantling . The United States will pay Russia a $ 60-million advance against payments Russia will eventually receive for reprocessing the uranium from the Ukrainian warheads for use as enriched uranium fuel for nuclear_power plants . A clear majority of Ukrainians say they see no reason to keep the atomic missiles left on their soil after the breakup of the Soviet_Union . &quot; The fewer nuclear_weapons we have , the more peacefully we will live , &quot; said Julia Dmitrienko , 40 , an engineer . &quot; What are we going_to do with them -- fight Russia ? &quot; said Vladimir Nazaruk , 45 , a Kiev building official . &quot; No one would win. &quot; But they want &quot; fair compensation &quot; for the weapons . As Parliament put that sum at $ 3 billion , Kravchuk will have to try to convince voters and lawmakers that the current deal -- by some estimates worth about $ 1 billion -- is the best he can get . A poll published Thursday found that 17.4 % of Ukrainians would agree unconditionally to exchange the weapons in return for oil and gas and 31.4 % would agree to such a deal if absolutely necessary . The Socis-Gallup poll found that 36 % oppose giving_up the weapons . Kravchuk has not yet indicated whether he will try to persuade the current Parliament to accept the agreement , present it to the new Parliament to be elected March 27 or insist that the &quot; statement &quot; signed Friday is not a treaty and thus does not require parliamentary ratification . Lawmakers have already said they will insist on the right to decide . Key lawmakers , including the Speaker of the Parliament and his deputy , have been silent on the deal . Neither met Clinton at the airport . Kravchuk supporters say the economic_crisis has become so acute -- Ukraine ' s monthly inflation_rate hit 80 % in December , compared to 12 % in Russia -- that even hard-line lawmakers will be inclined to compromise . &quot; The man ( Kravchuk ) has signed a paper saying he can do_it , &quot; one senior American official said . &quot; Am I 200 % sure he can deliver ? Let ' s see how it plays . He has a lot of incentives. &quot; But pro-nuclear lawmaker Serhij Semenets said Kravchuk ' s authority has been eroded . &quot; Kravchuk does lobby , but the deputies are less and less influenced , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s considered unseemly to support Kravchuk. &quot; Lawmaker Tatiana Jakheeva joked that America has nothing to fear -- even from a nuclear Ukraine . &quot; Don ' t be afraid of us , &quot; she said . &quot; The worst Ukraine can do to America is send Kravchuk to be ( Clinton ' s ) press secretary. &quot; Special correspondent Mary Mycio contributed to this report . Global Gun_Control The agreement to peacefully dismantle Ukraine ' s huge nuclear arsenal signed_in Moscow on Friday would work like this : 1 . Ukraine ships warheads to Siberia , where Russian technicians extract the highly enriched uranium and turn it into less powerful civilian reactor fuel . The United States has offered to help pay_for the cost of dismantling the weapons . 2 . In return , Ukraine receives fuel rods for its civilian power_plants and debt relief from Russia . 3 . The United States , Russia and Britain provide security assurances to Ukraine . 4 . To sweeten the deal , the White_House is offering Ukraine at least $ 155 million in economic aid . Mining a Missile The deadly part of a nuclear missile -- the warheads -- resemble upside down ice_cream cones . Within their highly protective walls is highly enriched uranium . Under the agreement , the uranium taken from Russian and Ukrainian warheads will be converted into low-enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel for nuclear_power plants . Once weapons-grade uranium is converted into low-enriched uranium , it can ' t be used in nuclear bombs . Russia will sell uranium to the United States Enrichment Corp. , which will use the material to supply nuclear_power stations around the world .
