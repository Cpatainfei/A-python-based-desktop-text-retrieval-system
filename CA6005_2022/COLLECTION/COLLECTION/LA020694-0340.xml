   <HEADLINE> BACKERS SAY RECALL WAS TRIGGERED BY PRINCIPLE ; POLITICS : SEN . ROBERTI SAYS FOES ARE FIREARMS FANATICS ANGRY ABOUT HIS ASSAULT-WEAPONS BAN . BUT LEADERS EMPHASIZE A GOOD-GOVERNMENT AGENDA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Depending_on who ' s talking , the leaders of a recently qualified effort to recall state Sen . David A . Roberti ( D-Van Nuys ) are an eclectic coalition of madder-than-hell proponents of good government or a secretive bunch of vindictive gun nuts . Recall advocates claim to be reformers who see Roberti , the powerful Senate president pro_tempore for 13 years , as epitomizing a political_system gone haywire with soft-on-crime liberalism , corruption , arrogance and deal-making . But Roberti , who last week became the first_state lawmaker in 80 years to be forced into a recall election , has denounced attempts to characterize his foes as anything other_than vengeful -- and potentially dangerous -- firearms fanatics angry about a bill of his that led to a ban on assault weapons in 1989 . &quot; that ' s what this is all about , &quot; Roberti said at a recent news_conference , holding_up an Uzi assault_rifle -- one of those banned from sale in California . Not so , says Bill Dominguez , chairman and standard-bearer of the anti-Roberti forces , who describes the senator ' s charges as a &quot; smoke screen. &quot; But in an interview , Dominguez acknowledged that the recall leadership has entered into a marriage_of_convenience with gun groups . &quot; When we called ( gun activists ) for financial help , it was almost a situation of them being ready to mortgage their houses , &quot; Dominguez said . &quot; But call_up someone and ask them to contribute to a movement to stop corruption in government , and they ' d say , ' that ' s nice -- we ' ll get_back to you. ' &quot; The alliance was practical politics , said Dominguez , a Democrat . &quot; To do something like this you need a tremendous amount of energy and money , and you can ' t get that with three people operating out of a garage , &quot; he said . But while Dominguez , a systems analyst with the Trans-america Insurance Group and a candidate in the recall election , denies that firearms issues are the driving force behind his political activism , he nevertheless shares with enthusiasts of the 2nd Amendment the belief that gun_control is liberalism ' s failed substitute for getting_tough on criminals . &quot; I guess I ' ve been hanging_around these 2nd Amendment people too long , &quot; Dominguez said , joking about their influence . Dominguez also ran against Roberti in 1992 . The anti-Roberti movement has paid a stiff price for its alliance with the anti-gun control forces . Such ties have handed Roberti valuable ammunition in his bid to virtually demonize his foes as single-issue gun &quot; fanatics &quot; or &quot; extremists. &quot; The evidence has been compelling enough to prompt Handgun Control Inc. , the sponsor of the recently passed federal Brady bill , to jump to Roberti ' s defense . The senator ' s aides have said they hope to turn the recall , scheduled for April 12 , into a national referendum on gun_control . &quot; It ' s a very intelligent ploy on his part , &quot; said Russ Howard , one of the behind-the-scenes leaders of the anti-Roberti group . Still , the recall movement cannot be dismissed as merely a puppet of the gun lobby . For example , among the five official sponsors of the recall are Glenn Bailey , 38 , an Encino educator and longtime environmental activist ; Hans Rusche , 63 , an engineering executive and local leader of Ross Perot ' s United We Stand movement , and Dolores White , 59 , a realtor and veteran activist in county and state Republican circles . Both Bailey and White ran against Roberti in 1992 . White and seven others , including Dominguez and a Canoga Park gun dealer , this week filed as candidates to replace Roberti if the recall succeeds . Although his participation is often cited to rebut charges that the recall is a product of gun-rights monomaniacs , Bailey is not insensitive to 2nd Amendment issues . A San Fernando Valley leader of the Green Party , Bailey has said that while he believes there is &quot; far too_much firepower in the hands of the public , &quot; he is &quot; equally distrustful &quot; of letting the government own all weaponry -- thus sounding a favorite theme in the gun movement , that private gun ownership is a bulwark against government tyranny . On the other hand , Rusche said recently : &quot; This gun thing has been played_up too_much by Roberti and the media . There ' s no question these people are involved . But the ( National Rifle Assn. ) hasn ' t supported us with money. &quot; Besides , Rusche personally applauds Roberti ' s assault-weapon ban . &quot; Such high-tech weapons belong on the battlefield , not on our streets , &quot; he said . But the Roberti camp contends that such views are the exception rather than the rule_in a movement spawned by the gun lobby . The Roberti thesis got a major boost when the media obtained a lengthy , confidential memo laden with sinister , threatening rhetoric , written to the NRA by recall advocate Howard . In the memo , Roberti is graphically described as the target of the anti-gun control movement . &quot; The beast is wounded , &quot; the memo says in one section , a reference_to Roberti ' s costly 1992 struggle to win election to the Valley-based seat of former state Sen . Alan Robbins . &quot; It ' s time to go_in for the kill before he can run_for something like attorney general. &quot; Howard has justified the memo ' s strident anti-gun control language as a natural part of a sales pitch designed to get the NRA interested in supporting the Roberti recall . Howard ' s involvement with the recall also stems from his participation in a failed 1990 campaign to block the reelection of former state Assemblyman Mike Roos . Howard said he joined the anti-Roos campaign because of the 1989 assault-weapons ban , which Roos co-authored . On the other hand , Dominguez and Howard say they have gotten no help from the NRA for their current recall drive . &quot; I would have killed to have gotten their mailing_list &quot; of 350 # 000 California members , Dominguez has admitted . And the recall leadership denies that they are out_to punish Roberti for his assault-weapons law . &quot; I ' m not counting_on the gun issue to make or break this recall , &quot; Dominguez said . Recall advocates also say the success of their petition drive proves that theirs is not a single-issue campaign . More_than 20 # 000 registered voters signed the petitions that outlined -- as required by law -- proponents ' arguments for recalling Roberti , as well as the senator ' s rebuttal . But the pro-recall arguments mention as the last of five points that Roberti &quot; advocates gun_control but opposes capital_punishment even for murderers of children. &quot; Howard , 37 , a stockbroker and South Bay resident , also resents being portrayed as a gun fanatic . He points to the fact -- confirmed by other sources -- that he was the first research_director for the Proposition 174 school-voucher campaign . He also claims to have been an avid precinct worker for the campaign to oust former California Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird . A lifetime NRA member , Howard insists that it is Roberti ' s political abuses that have motivated his drive to oust the senator . It was in 1990 that Howard met Dominguez and joined Californians Against Corruption ( CAC ) , a group organized around the effort to defeat Roos . CAC was founded by Dominguez and Richard L . Carone , a Rancho Palos Verdes resident and president of Finley Oil_Well Services , an oil-drilling maintenance firm that has reported revenues of $ 5 million to $ 10 million . At its headquarters in Signal Hill , the CAC ' s taped answering machine message hotly denounces Roberti as one whose soft-on-crime record &quot; has protected and released violent criminals like the ones who murdered Polly Klass and Kimba Reynolds and yet opposed your right to defend yourself against them. &quot; CAC activities also have been praised by Neal Knox , a national gun-rights leader who has complained that the NRA has not been vigilant enough in stopping gun-control legislation , including California ' s assault-weapons ban . Perhaps the most controversial member of CAC has been Cuban emigre Manuel Fernandez , who once told The Times that the &quot; whole purpose of the recall of Roberti is retribution &quot; for his weapons ban . In 1983 , Fernandez was convicted of illegally owning a machine_gun . Despite a recent effort by the recall movement to distance themselves from him , Fernandez attended a news_conference of the recall leadership Jan . 6 . Referring to the Fernandez conviction , Roberti campaign press secretary Staci Walters said : &quot; This is just another example of the fact that the recall proponents have clear motives to wreak revenge on Sen . Roberti because of his leadership on banning assault weapons , that outgun cops and cut_down kids. &quot; With or without Fernandez , CAC is little more_than a front for the NRA , according to Roberti . His backers have filed complaints with the state Fair Political Practices Commission , alleging that CAC violated state law by failing to disclose a $ 5 # 000 contribution received in 1990 from the NRA Political Victory Fund . These complaints stemmed from CAC ' s 1990 campaign to block Roberti ' s difficult bid to win election to a Valley-based Senate seat . Howard , now a leader of the CAC , said the failure to disclose the NRA gift was a technical mistake . Dominguez ' s political views have been shaped by his own brush with authoritarian rule as the son of a Cuban businessman who fled his homeland in 1961 because of his political opposition to Fidel Castro . &quot; Let ' s put it this way , &quot; Dominguez , 43 , said . &quot; I don ' t feel as complacent as_many people do about the situation we ' re in. &quot; For Dominguez , it is galling that Roberti , the leader of a legislative body that has seen several of its members convicted and charged with political corruption in recent years , can spend more_than $ 2 million to win election to a seat in the Valley even though his residence is in Hollywood . Bailey , the environmental activist , shares a similar sense of outrage about Roberti . &quot; It ' s despicable that he was able to bring his laundered political money and buy a seat in the Valley , &quot; Bailey said in an interview . After attending meetings where Roberti was present , Bailey said he was shocked to learn that the senator did not know about prostitution problems on Sepulveda Boulevard and was indifferent about protecting the Sepulveda Basin from development . &quot; This coalition to oust Roberti includes people from the right , the left and the middle , &quot; Bailey said . &quot; We don ' t agree on all_the issues , but we are united in our belief that Roberti is unfit for office. &quot; Also active in the coalition is Ralph Morrell , a legislative gadfly in Sacramento . Morrell gained considerable recognition for his efforts to force disclosure of how legislators spend their office budget funds . Morrell and Ted Costa , who is the executive_director of the People ' s Advocate , the group founded by tax fighter Paul Gann , recently flew to Los Angeles to join the recall leadership at a news_conference . &quot; I ' ve been reassured that this is not a gun issue thing only , &quot; the retired Navy_man said . John Stites , a candidate for Los Angeles County sheriff , is another recent recruit to the coalition as it seeks to broaden its base . Stites , a sergeant in the Sheriff ' s Department , sensed during meetings with leaders of the recall campaign that the group is not dominated by anti-gun control fanatics . &quot; Certainly , that ' s not my gig , &quot; Stites said .</TEXT>
