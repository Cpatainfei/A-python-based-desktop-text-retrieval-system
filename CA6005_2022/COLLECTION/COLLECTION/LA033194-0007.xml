   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; ' MEXICO ' SHOW NOT A PRETTY PICTURE ; EXCEPTIONAL WORK LOST IN MUDDLED PHOTO EXHIBITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Mexico Through Foreign Eyes : 1850-1990 &quot; is among the sillier shows of the season to date . A sentimental travelogue masquerading as a photography exhibition , it seems less interested in examining works_of_art than in selling a mythologized picture of Mexico . Curators Carole Naggar and Fred Ritchin , hired to organize the show and assemble its bilingual catalogue for the independent Santa Monica exhibitions firm Pilar Perez and Associates , selected more_than 180 photographs by more_than four dozen American and European visitors to Mexico since the middle of the 19th Century . Among them are such major figures as William Henry Jackson and Henri Cartier-Bresson , as well as such compelling , if lesser-known , artists and photojournalists as Ellen Auerbach and Alex Webb . After stops in Mexico_City , Monterrey and New York , it is currently on view at the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center in Westwood . * The organizers claim that throughout the medium ' s 150-year history , Mexico has been the site of more artistic breakthroughs for visiting American and European photographers than any other country . Neither the show nor the book offers much to substantiate the claim , but who knows ? Maybe they ' re right . What ' s perplexing is the nature of the assertion as an organizing principle for an exhibition . It suggests something magical , mysterious and enduring about Mexico , something so unusually compelling that over the course of 150 years it galvanized the art of visiting photographers as radically different from one another as France ' s Cartier-Bresson and Italy ' s Tina Modotti , or as sharply distinctive as the incisive chronicler of urban children ' s lives , Helen Levitt , and the stark abstractionist of city walls , Aaron Siskind . In brief catalogue essays each curator pursues an aura characterizing Mexico -- or characterizing many outsiders ' views of it -- that is potent enough to have transformed the artistic outlook of widely disparate photographers . Naggar finds it in the Mexican embodiment of &quot; otherness &quot; for some Europeans and North_Americans ; Ritchin finds it in Mexico ' s particular sense of time . Yet any search for such a magic_bullet capable of transforming the work of perceptive artists makes little sense . It also does a disservice to their art . You ' re encouraged to stop considering the acute specificity of a photographer ' s work , but that is what makes any art finally worth looking_at . Instead , you ' re coaxed to search for a missing common_denominator that makes Cartier-Bresson and Modotti , Levitt and Siskind somehow alike . Maybe it ' s something in the water ? &quot; Mexico Through Foreign Eyes &quot; might be most succinctly described as a NAFTA show . Underwritten by the Banco Nacional de Mexico ( BANAMEX ) , Eastman Kodak , Anheuser-Busch and Mexicana Airlines , and touring since 1993 , it ' s finally all about packaging and marketing the image of a country currently in the forefront of popular consciousness . It ' s too_bad , because there are some exceptional pictures to be found scattered throughout the otherwise muddled show . Few are likely to be a surprise ; in addition to the well-known Mexican pictures of Cartier-Bresson , Modotti and Levitt , there are fine pictures by the_likes_of Edward Weston , Paul Outterbridge , Harry Callahan , Arthur Tress , Richard Misrach , Paul Strand , Linda Connor and other accomplished photographers . Among the most arresting is an 1867 albumen print by the little-known Frenchman Francois Aubert , who was a kind of court photographer to the Emperor Maximilian . A rather more grisly task was recording the aftermath of Maximilian ' s execution , which Aubert had witnessed . His picture_shows the slain emperor ' s bullet-ridden , blood-stained white shirt , which has been tacked to the back of a door for display . The shirt , and by extension the photographic record of it , are bluntly offered to the viewer as factual evidence of the deed . Mundane reportage reverberates against a poetic intimation of St . Veronica ' s veil , which displays the image of the executed Christ as evidence of a miracle and was a popular subject in Mexican devotional painting of the period .</TEXT>
