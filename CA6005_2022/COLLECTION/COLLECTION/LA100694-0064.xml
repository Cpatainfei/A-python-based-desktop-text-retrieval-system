   <HEADLINE> NEWS BITES : THE HOT_SAUCE INFO SUPERHIGHWAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hot Hot Hot , the Pasadena hot_sauce boutique , claims its mail-order catalogue is the first food catalogue on the Internet . If you want to browse it with Mosaic ( hey , color graphics ! ) , http : / / www.hot.present.com / hot / is the address . Warning : For Exterior Use Only Speaking of hot_stuff , paprika sales were suspended in Hungary last week following the discovery of flour colored with red house paint in a third of the paprika samples tested . At least 40 Hungarians are hospitalized with lead_poisoning from the adulterated paprika and 18 people have been arrested in the scandal , which has been traced to recently opened fly-by-night paprika mills concentrating_on Hungary ' s voracious domestic paprika market . No warning has been issued about the major-brand paprika that Hungary exports to other countries . Java Jive Tejava , the brand of unsweetened , unflavored bottled tea , now also comes_in one-liter glass bottles . OK , maybe that ' s not the biggest news , but it ' s an excuse to note that when we reviewed bottled teas a_couple_of weeks ago , we unknowingly didn ' t give Tejava a fair shake . The bottle we tried must have been pretty old , since it had the kind of cap that requires a bottle_opener . Recent Tejava bottlings have twist-off caps . Fiery Cookbook &quot; The National Firefighters Recipe Cookbook &quot; features 175 easy , hearty recipes from every state in the nation , plus firehouse anecdotes , a glossary of firefighting terminology and eager comments on every recipe from a cartoon spokesdog named Cinders . ( Those who have to cook for big appetites will also appreciate the Firehouse Kitchen Rules , which begin , &quot; 1 . It doesn ' t matter what it tastes like as long as there is enough . 2 . The later the meal is served , the more food you will need . 3 . When in doubt , make_it Mexican. &quot; ) The book is a fund raiser for the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors . To order , send check for $ 15 plus $ 3 shipping ( 50 cents for each additional book ) to All Hands Publications , 2640 E . Virginia Ave. , Phoenix , Ariz . 85008 . Whale on Ice ? Whale bootlegging is nothing new -- the Soviet_Union had a secret operation in the Southern Hemisphere that processed 48 # 477 humpback_whales between ' 48 and ' 73 , while reporting only 2 # 710 -- and it ' s no surprise that the current whaling moratorium hasn ' t totally prevented it . Science Magazine recently published a DNA analysis of whale meat sold in Japan ( limited numbers of minke_whales , caught for scientific purposes , may still be sold for food there ) that suggests that some of the meat was from the fin_whale , which hasn ' t been legally caught since 1989 , and some of the rest was North Pacific humpback , which , if legally caught , would have to have been in cold storage for 27 years .
