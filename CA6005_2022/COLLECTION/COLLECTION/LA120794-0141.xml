   <HEADLINE> HUBBELL ADMITS TO FRAUDULENTLY BILLING CLIENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former Associate Atty . Gen . Webster L . Hubbell , one of President Clinton ' s closest friends , agreed Tuesday to cooperate with the Whitewater independent counsel and entered a guilty plea to charges that he had billed his legal clients fraudulently for at least $ 394 # 000 in personal expenditures between 1989 and 1992 . Once the nation ' s third-ranking law_enforcement officer , Hubbell , 46 , admitted to committing two felonies -- mail_fraud and tax_evasion -- each of which carries a maximum five-year prison sentence . He almost certainly will go_to prison , even though his sentence could be reduced in exchange for supplying information to Whitewater counsel Kenneth W . Starr . While Hubbell ' s crimes have virtually nothing to do with the central Whitewater allegations against the President , lawyers familiar_with the case said that his testimony could be helpful to Starr in determining whether Clinton appointees made any effort to interfere with the government ' s early investigation of the case . Starr told reporters outside the courthouse that he is &quot; looking_forward &quot; to Hubbell ' s cooperation with the inquiry , which so far has centered primarily on allegations that federally guaranteed savings and loan money may have been funneled improperly to Clinton through his investment in the Whitewater real_estate development in the Ozarks . Hubbell ' s courtroom confession also caused obvious personal and political embarrassment for the President , a frequent golf partner who once described Hubbell as &quot; my best_friend , &quot; and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , who was Hubbell ' s partner at the Rose Law_Firm of Little_Rock . Until he resigned from the Justice_Department last March 14 , Hubbell was a close legal adviser to the White_House and one of the most visible Arkansans in the Clinton_Administration . Not surprisingly , David Kendall , the President ' s lawyer , sought to distance the Clintons from Hubbell ' s crimes . &quot; This matter does not concern the President , the First_Lady or Whitewater Development Corp . in any way , &quot; Kendall said . In a contrite statement to the court at the close of the one-hour hearing in which he entered his plea , Hubbell indicated that he was painfully aware of the embarrassment he had caused the Clintons , the Rose Law_Firm and his family . &quot; I deeply regret that my actions have reflected on my family , friends and those who have placed me in positions of trust , &quot; Hubbell told Judge William R . Wilson . &quot; If the consequences of my actions were only mine , this would be a lot easier. &quot; Once widely admired in this town as a former college football star , former state Supreme Court chief_justice and a former mayor , Hubbell was clearly shaken by the experience of publicly confessing to private acts of greed that will tarnish his reputation and cause him to lose his license to practice law . His voice cracked , as if choking_back tears . In detailing the evidence that had been gathered against Hubbell , W . Hickman Ewing Jr. , an assistant to the independent counsel , told a remarkable tale of a highly successful , well-paid attorney who on at least 400 occasions charged his law_firm and its clients for his own family ' s extravagant expenditures at a variety of fancy shops in Little_Rock and Dallas , including a fur salon and Victoria ' s Secret . According to Ewing , Hubbell frequently used checks drawn_on the Rose Law_Firm ' s partnership banking account to pay_off personal credit_card bills . He then would add these charges to the bills sent to a wide variety of the firm ' s clients . Among the clients who were bilked in this manner were the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and the Resolution Trust Corp. , both of whom had hired the Rose Law_Firm to assist in the cleanup of several savings and loan failures in Arkansas . The prosecution cited one bill that Hubbell submitted to the FDIC on March 7 , 1990 , for work that the Rose Law_Firm did_in pursuing the government ' s case against Frost &amp; Co. , an accounting_firm , for negligence in auditing the accounts of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan . Madison was owned by James B . McDougal , Clinton ' s partner in the Whitewater investment . The bill asked the FDIC to reimburse the Rose Law_Firm $ 612 for so-called &quot; publications costs &quot; and $ 694.29 for &quot; deposition costs. &quot; But Ewing said that the FBI traced both of those expenditures back to personal credit_card purchases by Hubbell and his family . Hubbell did not charge his clients for all_of the personal bills that he paid from the law_firm checking_account , however . In some cases , Ewing said , Hubbell simply &quot; wrote_off &quot; the charge -- meaning that the law_firm itself shouldered the cost . It was the extraordinary number of these so-called &quot; write-offs &quot; by Hubbell that first caught the attention of his law partners after he went_to Washington to join the Administration in January , 1993 . When they questioned him , he promised to provide the firm with documentation to support the write-offs . But , as Ewing told the judge , &quot; it never came. &quot; Moreover , Hubbell filed tax_returns for the years 1989 through 1992 that did not reflect any of the income he received from his fraudulent billing practices , according to the government . In 1992 , for example , he received income of $ 309 # 168 , but reported only $ 194 # 966 . Overall , it is estimated that he failed to pay the government $ 130 # 291 in taxes owed . Normally , plea-bargains such_as the one between Hubbell and Starr are used as a way for the prosecution to obtain information from the defendant and for the defendant to limit his legal liability . To lawyers familiar_with Hubbell ' s case , the charges to which he pleaded guilty appear to be unusually stiff for such a plea-bargain . It was not known what other evidence Starr might have had against him , although some investigators had questioned whether Hubbell ' s work for the FDIC and the RTC represented a conflict_of_interest , since his firm also had represented Madison . As associate attorney_general , Hubbell also may have been privy to internal government discussions about a so-called &quot; criminal referral &quot; from the RTC to the Justice_Department regarding Madison that mentioned involvement by the Clintons . At the time of the referral , Paula Casey , the U.S. attorney in Little_Rock and a Clinton appointee , resisted passing it along to her superiors at the Justice_Department . U.S. District Judge William R . Wilson agreed to release Hubbell on_his_own recognizance , pending sentencing . No date was set for sentencing . Hubbell , who still_lives in Washington , was accompanied into court by his wife , Suzanne , and his attorney , former Iran-Contra committee counsel John W . Nields Jr . Although Suzanne Hubbell ' s shopping habits clearly contributed to her husband ' s downfall , he was clearly sensitive to her feelings during the hearing . &quot; Are you OK ? &quot; he whispered to her as Judge Wilson read the charges . She nodded .</TEXT>
