   <HEADLINE> ZAPATISTA ' DEMOCRACY CONVENTION ' TO PUSH FOR CHANGE ; MEXICO : REBELS CALL MEETING TO DISCUSS DEMANDS FOR POLITICAL REFORM . SKEPTICS WRITE OFF THE GATHERING AS A PLOY TO REGAIN THE INITIATIVE BEFORE THE ELECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This weekend could be either Woodstock without music or the most important strike for Mexican democracy in six decades . The ragtag Indian fighters who marched_out of the jungle Jan . 1 declaring war on the Mexican army have beat their guns into shovels . At the edge of the rebel wilderness stronghold here in the southern state of Chiapas , the Zapatista National Liberation Army has felled trees and dug terraces to build an outdoor auditorium the size of the Greek Theater for an audacious , non-military attack on the regime : a three-day convention to discuss what amounts to a peaceful overthrow of the government . The rebels say they want to rewrite the constitution , but they will probably settle for a resolution demanding a clean election in the Aug . 21 presidential poll , placing their movement once again in the vanguard of Mexicans clamoring for democracy . An impressive list of organizations has signed_up to send more_than 5 # 000 representatives , and the government is providing transportation , food and logistic_support for what in many countries might be considered a meeting of subversives . The National Democracy Convention is the latest twist in an uprising that has evolved with the surrealism of a novel by Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez . Since the initial 12 days of fighting , which left at least 150 people dead , the rebellion has become increasingly unconventional and inextricably enmeshed in election-year politics . Zapatistas in ski_masks and red bandannas initially captured the national imagination and international headlines with their demands for democracy and decent living conditions in their impoverished region . Since then , the world ' s attention has moved_on to bloodier uprisings , and in Mexico the cry_for democracy is now heard most clearly through the voices of intellectuals and politicians in Mexico_City . The Zapatistas are surrounded militarily and increasingly isolated politically . They are largely forgotten by everyone except the angry ranchers whose land lies within territory that the guerrillas still hold . Military intelligence indicates that divisions are emerging within the rebel ranks , as some members insist on the kind of national political reform that this weekend ' s convention envisions , while others want to take_advantage of the government offer of economic development programs for their region . Both economic and political issues were included in the rebels ' original list of demands . In the ensuing months , the economic demands have produced concrete proposals from the government with timetables for performance , while the political concerns have remained vague and were pointedly ignored in the government ' s peace offer . Against that backdrop , skeptics write_off the convention , which begins today , as a rebel ploy to regain the initiative before what promises to be the most closely contested presidential election in Mexican history . &quot; This is just more politics ; it has all been politics , &quot; one high-ranking Mexican army_officer said nonchalantly in a rare conversation with a reporter . &quot; This is a political situation , not a military one . They are trying to keep themselves in_the_public_eye , shouting that they are still alive . I don ' t believe that this will come_to much. &quot; The chairman of the conservative National Action Party dismissed the gathering as a &quot; a leftist Tower of Babel. &quot; Nevertheless , other politicians say privately that they will be watching the turnout as a measure of rebel support across the nation . Even within the rebel ranks , the purpose of the convention is muddled . Communiques inviting civic groups to attend said : &quot; The National Democratic Convention is an effort to peacefully organize the society against the ( ruling ) party and for the transition to democracy , liberty and justice . It is an organized and peaceful effort to reach a government of transition to democracy and a new constitution for our Mexico. &quot; But rank-and-file Zapatistas speak_of less ambitious goals . &quot; It will be a chance for us to share experiences with organizations in the north , Oaxaca and Guerrero , &quot; two other impoverished southern states , said Valentin , a Zapatista leader here in San Miguel , a village of wooden huts with dirt floors at the edge of rebel-held territory . Unlike Guadalupe Tepeyac , the village nearest the convention site , San Miguel has no electricity and no hospital . Since the cease-fire , a Red_Cross team has been posted here , providing better emergency care than nearby villages ever enjoyed before . &quot; We can join forces and coordinate efforts , &quot; Valentin said , squatting beside a makeshift roadblock of three logs that guards one of the two main entrances into a rebel-controlled area about half as big as Orange County . He is not talking_about coordinating armed attacks on military targets , but rather jointly marketing coffee and sugar while pressuring the government to pay_attention to the problems of peasant farmers . &quot; We don ' t want money , &quot; he said , explaining why the government ' s year-old agricultural subsidies program is not the solution . &quot; We want work. &quot; The seven months of the cease-fire have been difficult , complicating transportation problems for villages where the nearest dirt road can only be reached after hours of hiking over muddy paths . Zapatista guards cut_off trucks and cars at San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac , but the perimeter of the rebel-held zone is far from sealed . Security inside the village also has become less rigid . Although Zapatistas still ask that their last_names not be used , many who once covered their faces for pictures now invite a photographer to take their portraits . &quot; Why should we be afraid ? &quot; said Gustavo , a Zapatista . &quot; The government knows who we are . Let them come_after us . Either we will die or they will die . Then we will see who knows how to fight. &quot; A rival peasant group that refused to take_up arms has turned_over detailed information about the Zapatistas to the Mexican army . Soldiers said they have an exact count of how many rebels are in each village and who their leaders are , thanks to the head of the pacifist group , who is also the ruling party ' s congressional candidate in the district that includes the rebel stronghold . Since mid-January , the role of the 10 # 000 troops sent to Chiapas has been confined to gathering information and manning roadblocks . Army_officers said their orders are to allow unarmed travelers complete freedom to move about the area . &quot; We have our mission to protect the towns and keep order , &quot; said an officer , who spoke on the condition his name not be used . &quot; Good soldiers leave politics to the politicians. &quot; The people most frustrated with the standoff are the ranchers whose lands the rebels occupy . &quot; We have been waiting seven months for a solution , &quot; said Jorge Constantino Kantor , whose 136-acre cattle_ranch is behind Zapatista lines . &quot; What kind of a game are they playing ? &quot; In the weeks after the uprising , the young rancher was often characterized as a reactionary symbol of the problems that led to the uprising . But lately , his ideas have gained sympathy as a backlash has developed against the rebels . He has been elected head of the regional ranchers and property_owners association and was nominated as a ruling party candidate for the Mexican Congress but decided not to run . He now leads a sit-in of ranchers at the state capitol in Tuxtla Gutierrez . The protesting ranchers ' ranks have been reinforced as squatter groups inspired by the Zapatistas have invaded an estimated 300 ranches in the state outside the guerrilla-held area . In addition , merchants who depend_on the ranchers for business have also demonstrated support . They estimate business is down 40 % . Since May , the government has paid ranchers $ 6 an acre per month in compensation for occupied land . But that is far from the solution the ranchers want . &quot; We want a return to the rule_of_law , &quot; Constantino Kantor said . &quot; Marcos has been painted as some sort of Robin_Hood . Well , this is not Sherwood Forest . This is my ranch. &quot;</TEXT>
