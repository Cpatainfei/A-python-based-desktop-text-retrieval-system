   <HEADLINE> CONTROL OF BOSNIA ARMS TO BE TOTAL , OFFICIAL SAYS ; BALKANS : NATO COMMANDER DECLARES DEADLINE FOR WITHDRAWAL OF WEAPONS FROM SARAJEVO IS UNAMBIGUOUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Monday deadline for the withdrawal of heavy_weapons from around Sarajevo is unambiguous , and U.N. troops will exercise total control of weaponry turned_in by Bosnian Serb and Muslim-led government forces , the NATO commander who would order any air strikes said Wednesday . &quot; Control of weapons means that they are regrouped and collected and under U.N. control . If a warring faction wants to use those weapons , it would have to fight to get them , &quot; Adm . Jeremy Boorda told reporters here , gainsaying speculation from Washington that the United Nations might settle for less than absolute authority over weapons remaining in the area after the deadline . U.N. commanders in Bosnia-Herzegovina have exactly the same understanding of what control means , the American four-star admiral said . &quot; Our mandate hasn ' t shifted . Our rules haven ' t shifted , &quot; said Boorda , who heads the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s Southern Command here along with the bristling armada of NATO warplanes poised at Italian air_bases and on carriers in the Adriatic . Neither will the deadline shift , Boorda said . &quot; It ' s the U.N. ' s deadline , and it ' s the NATO deadline . There ' s no ambiguity about that. &quot; A NATO ultimatum issued last week and aimed principally at the Serbs gives both sides in the struggle over Sarajevo until an hour after midnight Sunday to withdraw artillery , mortars and other heavy_weapons from within a 12-mile radius of the Bosnian capital or turn them over to U.N. peacekeepers . Failing that , NATO warplanes -- American , British , French and Dutch -- could strike at the United Nations ' behest anytime thereafter . NATO jets flew routine missions over Bosnia on Wednesday as training for possible attacks and to enforce a U.N. &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over the former Yugoslav republic . One of the patrolling jets , an American F-16 fighter-bomber , crashed Wednesday morning after malfunctioning over Slovenia near that former Yugoslav republic ' s border with northeastern Italy . The pilot ejected safely . Boorda , who is favored to become the next U.S. chief of naval operations , according to reports from Washington on Tuesday , said he is in constant touch with the U.N. commander in Sarajevo , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose . Rose could ask_for air strikes before Monday if there is new shelling of Sarajevo , which has lived under_fire for 22 months . A weeklong truce there appears to be holding , however , despite minor violations that on Wednesday included the killing of a 56-year-old worker by a sniper . Some analysts believe that the Bosnian Serbs have as_many as 500 field pieces and mortars positioned around a city where 10 # 000 people have died since minority Serbs rebelled in 1992 to protest a Muslim-led secession from the disintegrating Yugoslav federation . The Bosnian Muslim armory is relatively modest , U.N. officers say . Boorda ' s view of how well the ultimatum is respected will be easily measured . &quot; I will be satisfied at midnight Sunday if the weapons are under_control or out of the area . Nothing else is going_to satisfy me , &quot; the admiral said . In a closed-door session at the United Nations on Tuesday , Kofi Annan , the U.N. undersecretary general for peacekeeping , laid a request for more troops and specialized equipment before ambassadors from the United States , Canada , Britain , France , Spain and the_Netherlands , diplomatic sources said . The menu had been prepared by Rose , who needs soldiers and radar equipment to help monitor Bosnian Serb weaponry in the_hills around Sarajevo . American sources also said Annan told the ambassadors that Rose had requested 2 # 000 to 3 # 000 troops and artillery-locating radar . An American official present at the session said that &quot; nobody volunteered a lot of troops. &quot; And he emphasized that the United States did not volunteer any . &quot; The United States does not supply ground troops &quot; to the U.N. Protection Force , the official said . In Washington , State_Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the Clinton_Administration ' s policy precludes the dispatch of U.S. ground troops unless the warring factions agree to a negotiated peace settlement . Diplomatic sources said that governments could send more troops to Sarajevo without convening the Security_Council to pass a new resolution authorizing them . But Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has had a difficult time persuading governments to send more troops . However , military analysts said France has agreed to send sophisticated counter-battery radar to U.N. forces in Sarajevo to help pinpoint Bosnian Serb artillery in the event of a NATO air strike . Times staff writers Stanley Meisler , Norman Kempster and Art Pine in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
