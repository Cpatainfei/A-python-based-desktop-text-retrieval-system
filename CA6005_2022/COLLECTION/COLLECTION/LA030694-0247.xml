   <HEADLINE> VOICES : LOOKING TO THE EAST FOR CURES TO WESTERN PAIN ; INITIALLY SKEPTICAL OF ORIENTAL MEDICINE , TIMOTHY TIMMONS NOW TOUTS THE VIRTUES OF THE DISCIPLINE AS A DEAN AT SAMRA UNIVERSITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Practitioners in Oriental medicine are not only trained in acupuncture but also in nutrition counseling , herbal medicine , exercise therapy and massage . We can ' t perform surgery in the United States , but Oriental medicine is especially well suited for patients with chronic degenerative conditions and pain . If the patient has acute symptoms , such_as an infection or a high fever , that clearly warrant Western medical and antibiotic therapies , then we refer the patient to tests right away . Most patients , though , are coming_into our clinic with Western diagnoses already in_hand and are seeking additional care in conjunction with their Western physicians . Although our clinic treats Asian patients , we see people from all ethnic backgrounds . We see people with conditions ranging from neck and back pain , sports injuries , gynecological and digestive complaints to stroke rehabilitation , cancer , depression and chemical dependency . Recently , we ' ve been seeing an increasing number of patients with HIV . Samra is setting_up a pilot study in_using Oriental medicine to increase blood_cell counts in HIV patients . One of the reasons why more people with chronic degenerative conditions are turning_to our profession is that acupuncture stimulates the body to function more efficiently so that it can heal itself . At Samra , we are trying to establish a field of integrative medicine whereby we train students to work with Western physicians to combine the best of both medical treatments . This notion of complementary_medicine also hits on a personal note . My wife , Christine , who is Chinese , is studying Western medicine at the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific in Pomona . We both realize the two systems of medicine have something to offer each other . Our profession is licensed as a primary health_care service by the state , and patients do not need a physician ' s referral . Some Western doctors view Oriental medicine with skepticism when they first encounter it because there has been insufficient research underlying acupuncture in this country . To those physicians , I would recommend open-minded skepticism . that ' s the way I approached it at first . I was a premed student at UC Berkeley in 1977 when my grandfather , who was suffering from tuberculosis , fell and broke his hip . Following his surgery , he responded poorly to the conventional physical_therapies and medications designed to alleviate his postoperative pain . Left with few options , my family began to research alternative therapies . No one in my family had any experience with Oriental medicine , but we decided to give_it_a_try because we had nothing to lose . Acupuncture helped alleviate his hip pain tremendously , and herbs helped him control his night sweats and coughing blood from his tuberculosis . Intrigued by the results , I decided to enroll at the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in San Francisco in 1980 after finishing my premed studies . At first , it was more of a curiosity , but I ' ve been studying it ever since . Although Chinese medicine is thought to have its roots around 200 B.C. , the movement to translate books into English is only a recent undertaking . There is a wealth of information to go_after , and Western culture has really only seen the tip of the iceberg . When I first started to study Oriental medicine , there were very few practitioners . Now , there are more_than 3 # 000 medical doctors and osteopaths who use acupuncture in the United States . I spent two years in China , Taiwan and Malaysia working in different clinics and research hospitals . I can read and understand Chinese , but I do not speak well enough to teach classes . Since the 1970s , there has been a steady stream of Western doctors going_to Asia to learn about Oriental medicine . This is an exciting time for me and my profession . Many principles of Oriental medicine coincide with the most significant developments in health_care today .</TEXT>
