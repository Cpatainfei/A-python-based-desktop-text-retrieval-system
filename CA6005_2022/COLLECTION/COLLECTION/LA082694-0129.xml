   <HEADLINE> POP_MUSIC REVIEW ; MANU DIBANGO PARTIES AT HOUSE OF BLUES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; A bit fatigue , &quot; commented an audience member after Manu Dibango strolled onstage at the House of Blues Wednesday , blowing his saxophone over his band ' s laid-back , jazzy noodlings . But the funkmeister from Cameroon was just pacing himself.By the third number , an up-tempo Senegalese reggae tune , Dibango and his Pan-African band had built_up a solid head of steam , and the dance_floor was packed . It ' s been 22 years since Dibango ' s Afro-disco single &quot; Soul Makossa &quot; was a U.S. hit . Wednesday ' s benefit_concert for the St . Jude Children ' s Research Hospital -- also featuring a lackluster performance from South_African trumpeter Hugh Masekela and his new band from Cape_Town -- proved that while the Paris-based Dibango may no longer be the intrepid musical adventurer he once was , he still throws a great party . Without the constellation of African stars ( Youssou N ' Dour , Ladysmith Black Mambazo , King Sunny Ade , Salif Keita , et al. ) whose vocals and songs receive the Dibango treatment in his latest album , &quot; Wakafrika , &quot; Dibango drew mostly on_his_own wealth of material to deliver in full on his stated promise to take the audience on a musical tour of Africa . His deep bass rap-chants seemed , as always , to bubble_up from the Earth ' s core , and his two singers contributed sweet , if not soaring , harmonies , particularly on the evening ' s set-pieces -- a rollicking interpretation of Miriam Makeba ' s &quot; Pata Pata &quot; and an enthusiastically received reinvention of &quot; Soul Makossa. &quot; ELENA OUMANO</TEXT>
