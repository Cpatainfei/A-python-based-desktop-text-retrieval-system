   <HEADLINE> KINGS ' RANSOM : FANS HELP PAY TAB ; HOCKEY : NEW COURT DOCUMENTS SHOW TEAM USED ADVANCE PLAYOFF TICKET MONEY TO MEET PAYROLL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On June 1 , 1993 , the Kings wrote a new chapter in franchise history , skating triumphantly for the first time into Game 1 of the Stanley Cup_finals to face the Montreal Canadiens . Not known then was how precarious the team ' s financial shape was off the ice . Only one day earlier , then-owner Bruce McNall ' s main company had defaulted_on an interest payment due_to Bank of America . Five weeks earlier , an emergency $ 2.8-million loan -- approved personally by one of Bank of America ' s top_executives -- was needed to meet the team ' s payroll and to pay suppliers . New court documents filed_in McNall ' s personal bankruptcy case and obtained this week by The Times show that , while the Kings were becoming the toast of Los Angeles in 1993 , the team also was struggling to meet its most basic financial needs . Later in the year , the threat of bankruptcy court loomed so seriously for the team that a contingency plan was drawn_up to put the club there . Only patience by some of McNall ' s bankers -- along with emergency funds made available at critical_points -- avoided that . The documents stand_in stark contrast to the public position taken by King officials -- seeking to ease concerns of fans and the team ' s high-paid players such_as Wayne Gretzky -- that the business of hockey went_on as usual despite McNall ' s deteriorating financial_condition . Instead , the documents portray the Kings as a high-wire act from early 1993 until this past May , when McNall sold 72 % of the team to Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen . One bank lawyer says in the documents that the club faced a &quot; nuclear meltdown &quot; had McNall failed to complete that sale . In addition , the documents contain embarrassing information likely to irk some fans . This past spring , the team , strapped for cash and performing nowhere near its Stanley Cup_final level of the previous year , met its $ 1.5-million , bimonthly payroll partly by tapping into some of the millions of dollars from fans ' advance playoff ticket money . Fans had to meet a February deadline to pay_for playoff tickets , even though it wasn ' t a certain thing the Kings would , indeed , make the playoffs . Eventually , the Kings failed to make the playoffs , and fans who had purchased the nonexistent playoff tickets ended_up effectively loaning the Kings their payroll money interest free . Refunds to those fans were not received until six weeks after the team ' s final game . The decision to use the money to cover payroll came despite strong objections from a Bank of America lawyer . One of the bank lawyers said the lender was &quot; very , very concerned &quot; about using the money for that purpose . The information on the playoff money is contained in sworn testimony from Robert Morrison , a lawyer with Pillsbury , Madison &amp; Sutro , who represented Bank of America in dealing with McNall . The bank had extended some $ 125 million in business and personal_loans to McNall before he sold a majority stake in the team in May . Cohen , now chairman of the Kings , confirmed in an interview that fans ' playoff ticket money was used to fund the payroll , but defended its use as &quot; a cash-flow issue. &quot; There have been no allegations that using the playoff ticket money for payroll was illegal . And discussions about using the money occurred while the team was still in contention in March , although by that time the team ' s chances of making the playoffs were minimal . But Morrison said in his statement that the bank conveyed to Sudikoff and Cohen &quot; the fact that the bank did not consent to that use and that it was an improper use of those funds . . . . &quot; At the time , Sudikoff and Cohen were working to close the purchase of a majority stake from McNall . Morrison says in his statement that &quot; the bank became very , very concerned that Sudikoff and Cohen , who were essentially running the Kings , were going_to use the playoff money to fund the payroll. &quot; He also said that he found_out -- not from Cohen and Sudikoff directly but from two bankruptcy attorneys , Kenneth Klee and Michael Tuchin , that the playoff funds were used for payroll . Klee and Tuchin had been retained to work with McNall and the Kings . A separate bank memo on file_in court says that the bank had been assured that the funds were to be kept at a separate account at City National_Bank and &quot; will not be used without the banks ' consent. &quot; The lengthy delay in postseason refunds for playoff tickets was a major sore spot this year for King fans , some of whom deposited thousands of dollars to reserve tickets before the playoff hopes evaporated . Some were especially irked because they had been asked to pay a 75 % down_payment in a letter from the Kings in January , before the February payment deadline . Cohen defended the use of the funds , adding that he and Sudikoff always intended to provide money for refunds . &quot; The fans are the lifeblood of our business and the money belongs_to the fans , &quot; Cohen said . &quot; We know that and it was our intention to refund the money to the fans. &quot; Cohen said he and Sudikoff had put a lot of money into the team at that point , and that Bank of America never stopped the Kings from using playoff money to cover payroll . &quot; The practice in sports is to use the funds as they come_in and if refunds are necessary , the ownership stands behind the refunds , &quot; Cohen said . Sudikoff and Cohen were known to have been funding payroll just before they closed the deal to buy a majority stake in the team -- up_to $ 4.1 million at one point -- but the disclosure that playoff money was used is new , as is the fact Bank of America objected so strongly . Said Cohen : &quot; Jeffrey and I had put_in a lot of cash . We were committed to putting cash_in . This is money the team billed . There is a practice of holding the money . &quot; They told us this was normal procedure . Kings management told us . I think ( the decision ) was probably made by Kings management and potential new ownership . It was clear the money would be returned and , in fact , it was. &quot; As previously reported , McNall ' s finances currently are being reorganized in bankruptcy court . In addition , sources have said that McNall has agreed to plead guilty to four criminal counts stemming from a federal investigation into his banking practices . The documents on file also include an examination of James Bailey , a former senior financial executive in McNall ' s operation , who claims he raised questions about possible irregularities in McNall ' s operation as far back as August , 1992 . A bankruptcy trustee ' s report released last week also said that Bailey found &quot; various financial improprieties in January , 1994 , including a bank_account of the Kings that was not kept_on its accounting books and into which millions of dollars were transferred during 1993-94. &quot; In his statement , Bailey claims he expressed concern to McNall then about rumors that the company was being seriously mismanaged and that company assets were being used for personal_expenses . According to Bailey ' s account of the meeting , McNall told him that some of his executives &quot; had been involved in systematically creating false financial statements. &quot; Said Bailey in his statement : &quot; . . . I said to him , ' These people are grossly incompetent. ' He ( McNall ) said to me , ' I need to keep them around . This is what they ' ve done for me in the past. ' &quot; Bailey declined to comment about his statement . A former McNall general counsel , Mark Eastman , has testified that he recalled Bailey telling McNall some of his executives were incompetent , but did not recall McNall ' s response . McNall lawyer Tom Pollack said that Bailey ' s testimony &quot; included numerous inaccurate statements and was contradicted in several instances by the testimony of several other employees. &quot; Added Richard Wynne , McNall ' s bankruptcy lawyer : &quot; Jim Bailey is still trying to figure_out ' Who shot J.F.K. ' and his testimony is based on unsupported guesses and is contradicted by other testimony and other evidence. &quot; Bailey also testified that he found evidence that &quot; substantial amounts_of_money had been taken_out of the Kings and put into a bank_account at First Los Angeles Bank. &quot; Bailey said he suspected that Bank of America was unaware that this money had been taken_away from their collateral . Upon his examination of the Kings ' financial records , he estimated $ 7.5 million was moved_out of the Kings into First Los Angeles between June 1 , 1993 and Dec . 31 , 1993 and that anywhere from two to three million was taken_out of the Kings between March , 1993 , and May 31 , 1993 . Additionally , Bailey said that he was told by Marty Greenspun , former King executive_director of finance , that in December , 1993 , a $ 309 # 000 check intended to go_to the Kings was intercepted by a McNall employee and put_in First Los Angeles Bank . Last year , after Christmas , Bailey was asked to serve as executive_vice_president and controller of the Kings . He said McNall and a lawyer asked him to &quot; go_down there and protect the Kings ' financial integrity and give comfort to Bank of America and give comfort to Sudikoff. &quot;</TEXT>
