   <HEADLINE> POLLS FAVOR CARDOSO IN BRAZILIAN VOTING ; ELECTION : EX-FINANCE MINISTER MAY AVOID RUNOFF IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE . HE IS CREDITED WITH HALTING RUNAWAY INFLATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fernando Henrique Cardoso , the man credited with halting Brazil ' s decade-long runaway inflation -- at least for now -- was poised Monday to become the nation ' s second democratically elected president in three decades . As the 94 million registered voters headed to the ballot_boxes , Cardoso , candidate of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party , was heavily favored by every national poll to capture the presidency . A final poll by Datafolha released Sunday projected that the 63-year-old sociologist and former senator would capture more_than 50 % of the vote and avoid a November runoff with projected runner-up Luis Inacio ( Lula ) da Silva , a former union leader and candidate of the left-leaning Workers ' Party . The first official tallies are not expected until this afternoon . Final official results will not be complete for at least five days . If they show that Cardoso did not get more_than 50 % of the vote , he could face Lula , as Da Silva is universally known , in a Nov . 15 contest . Cardoso -- an author , a former ambassador to the United States and , briefly , a political exile during the country ' s 21-year military dictatorship -- swept to the front of a field of eight presidential hopefuls atop a wave of support for an economic plan he devised while serving earlier this year as the country ' s finance_minister . Following the commencement in July of his Real Plan -- which included the introduction of a new currency , the real -- inflation dropped from 50 % in June to 6 % in July and less than 1 % in August . As the nation ' s economy stabilized , voters turned quickly away from Lula , once the leading candidate , and toward Cardoso . &quot; By voting for him , &quot; said student Virginia Goas , 20 , after casting her vote for Cardoso in Sao Paulo , &quot; it guarantees that the plan will continue to work. &quot; Mateus Helio of Sao Paulo also voted for Cardoso . &quot; He ' s stabilized Brazil , &quot; said the 54-year-old composer . &quot; That hasn ' t happened in a long_time . He deserves to be president. &quot; If elected , Cardoso will be the second popularly elected president since 1964 , when a military dictatorship took power . The military ruled until 1984 , when Jose Sarney was installed as president through a parliamentary process . Fernando Collor de Mello became president in 1989 following national elections but was impeached three years later on corruption charges and succeeded by his vice_president , Itamar Franco . Monday ' s elections were the biggest in Brazil ' s history , with voters choosing not only a new president but also hundreds of members of Congress , two-thirds of the Senate , all 27 governors and 1 # 500 state legislators . In major cities such_as Rio de Janeiro , Sao Paulo , Salvador and Belo Horizonte , voters waded to the polls on streets littered with election pamphlets , posters and papers distributed by hand , thrown to pedestrians from passing cars or rained_down like confetti from office_buildings during the final days of the campaign . Voting is mandatory in Brazil for residents aged 18 to 70 . Those 16 and 17 can vote if they desire . Monday was declared a national_holiday to assure voters time to go_to the polls . &quot; This campaign has been really great &quot; because it has avoided mudslinging , Cardoso told reporters in Sao Paulo as he headed to his polling_place . Lula , 48 , denounced the election as &quot; illegitimate &quot; after casting his vote_in an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo . Cardoso , he said , was boosted by big business , the media , the Franco government and the distribution of fraudulent sample ballots . More_than 12 million incorrect sample ballots used to educate voters before the election were found in the possession of Cardoso ' s party and in the offices of two other parties with which he has formed alliances . On the ballots , Lula ' s name appeared third instead of fourth , as it appears on the official ballot . Lula said the incorrect position would confuse millions of illiterate voters who had been taught to vote according to the position of the candidate ' s name on the ballot . Election officials and members of Lula ' s party said they will be watching the vote tabulations carefully to see how many votes Carlos Gomes receives that could have been intended for Lula . Gomes , who is third on the ballot , is projected to receive only 3 % of the vote . Election officials will also be watching the vote tallies in the newly formed state of Tocinas , where , in 70 of the state ' s 123 cities , there are more registered voters than there are people . State election officials launched a belated investigation Friday . The government on Monday sent troops to 12 states to maintain order , but a Superior Electoral Court spokeswoman said there had been no reports of violence or fraud . Twenty-six members of Lula ' s party were arrested in the state of Santa Catarina , however , for campaigning too close to an election site , and voting was temporarily stopped at a balloting site in Rio de Janeiro when a gun battle broke_out nearby between police and drug_traffickers .</TEXT>
