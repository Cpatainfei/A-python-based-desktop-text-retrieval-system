   <HEADLINE> TRAVELING IN STYLE ; PAPA WAS A ROLLING STONE ; ERNEST HEMINGWAY ROAMED THE WORLD , BUT MADE HIMSELF AT_HOME IN FOUR VERY DIFFERENT CORNERS OF NORTH_AMERICA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ERNEST HEMINGWAY LIVED AN INTERESTING LIFE . WRITING , he said , is alchemy , a blend of observation , experience , travel and imagination . From that , he made words into style . He stayed devoted to his craft throughout the whole journey -- and his sense of place was as sharp as an ice_pick . Hemingway is well-traveled territory himself , of course . Every secret that can be uncovered about him , every aspect of his life and work that can be interpreted , already has been . His trail is old , but it is not so cold as you might think . And following his footsteps has this reward : Hemingway favored the kinds of places that are easy to enjoy -- the dizzying dark waters of the Gulf_Stream , the high blue_sky of the Rockies , the boisterous corners of good saloons . . . . UNDER THE STARS IN THE STEAMY AIR AT HEMINGWAY ' S 95TH BIRTHDAY_party , I dance the rumba with my wife on the old_man ' s second-story veranda in Key West , Fla . The band plays_on the lawn below and the weepy trees are draped with lights . Through the window we can see his toilet and the bed he shared with his second wife , Pauline , and the clay Picasso sculpture of a cat that is glued to his dresser -- and , off in back , the detached studio with the old Royal portable where he wrote sentences that even today have the artist ' s unmistakable brush strokes in them . The rumba is my wife ' s idea . &quot; Hemingway was a bastard , &quot; she ' d said , &quot; but he was a romantic , no ? Dance with me. &quot; Frankly , I don ' t know that Hemingway ever danced . But I know when to say yes in the starlight . And I know how to rumba . Hemingway arrived here , in the southernmost city in the continental United States , in April , 1928 , on the advice of John Dos Passos &quot; to dry_out his bones. &quot; By the time he departed in December , 1939 , he had left such an indelible mark that his haunts remain the biggest tourist attractions in the Florida Keys to this day . Visitors crowd Hemingway ' s former house at 907 Whitehead St. , now a museum and home to about 54 descendants of his swarm of six-toed cats . His favorite saloon , Sloppy Joe ' s , is a rock ' n ' roll bar with a Hemingway mural behind the stage and pictures of him on the wall . The saloon where wife No . 3 , Martha Gellhorn , pursued him is now called Capt . Tony ' s . The marina where he docked his boat , the Pilar , still bristles with fishing_boats . Shopkeepers at local bookstores say they do at least 15 % of their business in Hemingway publications . &quot; People come_down here for lots of reasons , &quot; says John Boisonault , proprietor of Key West Island Books , &quot; and they seem to get wrapped_up in Hemingway . Some people cannot name two of his books and end_up paying $ 500 for a first edition . Others can tell you the most amazing trivia -- how many steps there were_on the walkway up_to his boyhood cabin at Walloon Lake in Michigan -- but they don ' t know the year Scott Fitzgerald died . One thing I can tell you , though : Hemingway sells more books now than when he was alive. &quot; Once a year for the past 13 years , in the heat of July ( when Hemingway himself always made_sure to be somewhere else ) , a festival has been convened here in his memory . Though the event ' s organizers have tried to give the festival some trappings of seriousness , with writers workshops , storytelling performances and a first-novel contest , it remains mostly a campy week that gives Hemingway fans a terrific excuse to go_on a bender and celebrate his birthday . One tour book describes the festival as &quot; a ritual of alcohol indulgence. &quot; Indeed , Key West ' s beaches are lousy , its offshore reef is dying , the fishing is not what it used to be -- but the bars and Hemingway ' s memory endure in a boozy , fun-loving embrace . This year at the festival , more_than 80 men have entered the three-day Hemingway look-alike contest , and everywhere you turned_in Key West you saw a burly chap with a pot gut and a silver beard , sly grin , khaki shorts and a long-billed fishing hat -- a good many ghosts with cold drinks_in their hands . If you insist , of course , you can always find someone to talk with , to argue the contradictions that make Hemingway so lastingly interesting : He glorified the kill , but would n ' t shoot an elephant because it was too majestic . He was a macho maniac , but his posthumously published &quot; Garden_of_Eden &quot; was_full of androgyny and gender-switching . He was a bigot and an anti-Semite , but he sought_out , befriended and glorified the working underclass , and his generosity is without dispute . He was a poseur . He was a man of deeds . And , excuse me , may I have another rum soda , please ? NINETY MILES AWAY , ON THE OTHER SIDE OF the world , is Cuba . At night , approached from the air , Havana is a city of few lights . Abandoned by its old ally the former Soviet_Union , and periodically embroiled in yet another bitter showdown with its erstwhile friend the United States , Cuba suffers oil shortages and power blackouts , as well as scarcities of food and other necessities of life . For more_than a generation , the United States has sought to restrict travel and trade with Cuba . But during quiet periods -- decidedly unlike the recent blustery confrontation between Presidents Fidel Castro and Bill_Clinton -- Americans nonetheless slip_in among growing numbers of Canadian and European tourists . And here the ghost of Papa Hemingway is preserved as nowhere else . Visitors -- including Americans -- are spared &quot; our present difficulties , &quot; as the Cubans like to say . What awaits them is not shortages but tourist taxis with plenty of gasoline , English-speaking guides , hotels with ample food and special tourist-issue soap and shampoo , plenty of rum and cigars and a tourist currency based not on the devalued Cuban_peso but on the U.S. dollar . A common route is through Nassau in the Bahamas ( see Guidebook ) . On the flight I took last summer were a_few returning Cubans and a number of tourists -- from Argentina , Canada , Japan , the Bahamas , England and two of us from the States . My fellow American is an old DC-3 pilot , who assures me that &quot; Cuban fliers are great. &quot; I ' m glad to hear this since I had earlier witnessed the disconcerting sight of a mechanic jabbing a giant screwdriver into the engine on our tired Soviet-made AK-24 turboprop , coaxing it to start . We arrive_at Havana ' s Jose Marti International Airport with tropical lightning flickering around us . Our plane lands so gently the tires don ' t even squeak . Perhaps the pilot is concerned by their lack of tread . ( I am. ) It is 35 years since Hemingway left , 36 years since Castro ' s revolution . The night air is hot , heavy and moist , rich with the damp smell of rotting vegetation buffered by the scents of wild tropical flowers . The past lives on in many ways here -- ways that are not usually beneficial to the Cubans but are certainly a curiosity for visiting Americans . Perhaps one-quarter of the cars on the streets , for instance , are spongy , leftover 1950s Detroit-built Buick roadsters and workaday Chevy coupes and boxy old Plymouths . Many are painted brightly . These mix with an assortment of Soviet trucks , belching buses and occasional donkey_carts -- plus about a_zillion bicycles and sidecar motorcycles . The architecture of Havana dates_from 1600 or so until about 1960 , when time seems to have stopped . I saw many buildings falling_apart , but the Plaza Hotel was not one of them . Built at the turn_of_the_century on the edge of Old Havana , it is a colonial-style structure with arched ceilings , stained glass , a grand_piano , an indoor fountain , free-flying indoor birds and a 24-hour bar that smells of a century ' s worth of cigars . I have chosen to stay here because it is a block from Obispo Street , the pedestrian thoroughfare that stretches down to the harbor and also to the site of Hemingway ' s favorite Havana restaurant and bar , the Floridita . In the 1940s and ' 50s , the Floridita was among the most glamorous and decadent hangouts in the world , and the place was always packed . Twenty years ago , I first saw those sharp black-and-white pictures of Hemingway and Spencer Tracy and Gary Cooper and the gang at the corner of the restaurant ' s wooden horseshoe bar , and I have wanted to visit the place ever since . Tonight , a distinguished-looking Cuban in a red jacket welcomes me , and there are empty seats to choose from . I take a place next to the brass chain that enshrines Hemingway ' s corner stool . Propped on the end of the bar is a rare photograph of Hemingway with Castro , taken at a fishing tournament in 1960 . Overhead is a three-quarter-size bronze bust of the author . There is only one cocktail to request at the Floridita : A slushy daiquiri ceremoniously prepared with fresh limes and no sugar -- a drink supposedly invented by Hemingway ' s favorite barman here , Constantino Ribailagua . Icy fruit and rum drinks have been popular_with Havana ' s elites since 1810 , when the first shipment of ice arrived_at the Floridita from Boston . My daiquiri is astringent and it coaxes forth the ghosts of the Lost Generation . The decor of the place has changed . The frosted ripple-glass windows of an earlier era have been replaced ; furniture and murals are unrecognizable from the old photographs . But there remains an unmistakable nostalgia . Dinner in the circular dining_room is elegant , and I will not criticize cooking in a country where wood_pulp is discreetly added_to the flour as an extender . The service is fastidious , and every crumb is swept_away between courses with a polished silver trowel . My red_snapper is small , grilled well and lavishly covered with enough thick gravy to fill the whole embossed china plate . There is no lettuce for the salad -- only onions and tomatoes . that ' s OK . After dinner , you can still light a nine-inch cigar at your table with impunity . In the morning , along with four Japanese tourists and a Florida coconut-grower , I tour Havana , partly by foot and partly in an air-conditioned Nissan van . The standard itinerary for the government-operated Havanatur includes the ancient forts of the city , the Revolution Museum ( where the boat Castro used for his invasion of the island is encased in glass ) , Revolution Square ( where Castro makes his speeches ) , a shopping plaza reserved for tourists , assorted other museums and city hospitals . Cubans are incredibly proud_of their universal health-care system , and we are promised free emergency medical services should the need arise . Orlando , our guide , adds a literary side trip : We walk to the Ambos Mundos Hotel , where Hemingway lived during his early days here . &quot; A good place to write , &quot; Hemingway called it . Today , the Ambos Mundos ( &quot; Both Worlds &quot; ) houses government functionaries , although Hemingway ' s unnumbered fifth-floor room is maintained as a small museum . After the tour , the coconut-grower and I visit the famous / infamous bar and restaurant La Bodeguita del Medio . Hemingway was a regular , but this tiny stone-block establishment has entertained so many of the world ' s artists and celebrities that the author barely stands_out among the yellowed photographs and old scrawled signatures covering the walls . At La Bodeguita , we meet a Cuban civil_engineer named Ricardo and his wife , Ellen . ( At their request , these are not their real names ; paranoia is not excessive here , but it exists. ) Ricardo is a Cuban army veteran of the war in Angola ; I am a U.S. Marine veteran of Vietnam . With our black_beans and strips of barbecued pork , we chew_over why the United States has rushed to do business with Cold_War enemies such_as China and North Vietnam but not Cuba . Then , to earn a bit of money , the couple agrees to drive us 12 miles to the hilltop suburb of San Francisco de Paula , where Hemingway ' s home , the Finca Vigia , is maintained as one of the premier Hemingway museums of the world . &quot; What car is this that barely runs and sags like an old gourd ? &quot; I ask . &quot; A Soviet Lada . We say , ' A Lada-trouble , ' &quot; puns Ricardo as we lurch through the slums , the engine dying , the clutch trembling , with suicidal bicyclists testing our screeching brakes at every turn . If you want to see how Hemingway lived from 1939 through the 1950s , the Finca Vigia is the place . His shoes , books , glasses , hunting trophies , Nobel Prize medallion , his boat , the Pilar , all sorts of relics , now belong_to the Cubans -- and most of them are_on casual display at the villa , as if Hemingway were merely away on summer safari . Also here is the converted wooden bookcase where he wrote standing_up and on a good_day dulled the points of seven No . 2 pencils . Here is the pool where he scandalized the neighbors by swimming nude . Here is the living room where he romanced young Italian countess Adriana Ivancich under the pained glare of Mary , his fourth and last wife . And here are the overgrown grounds , on which the author once instructed his gardener : &quot; Your job will be not to cut , not to prune. &quot; Some mysteries are not decipherable by the best of writers , like why Cuba ? In a magazine_article published in 1949 , Hemingway said merely this : &quot; You live_in Cuba because you can plug the bell in the party-line telephone with paper , so that you won ' t have to answer , and you work as well there in the cool early morning as you ever have worked anywhere in the world . But these are professional secrets. &quot; ERNEST HEMINGWAY BEGAN LIFE in Oak Park , Ill. , a suburb west of Chicago , in July , 1899 . He finished the journey in Ketchum , Ida. , 62 years later to the month , in July , 1961 . His boyhood home , at 339 N . Oak Park Ave. , is being slowly turned_into a museum . Another museum two blocks down , at 200 N . Oak Park Ave. , displays some of his high_school writing and memorabilia . A private home nearby at 600 N . Kenilworth Ave. , where Hemingway ' s family moved when he was 6 and and where he lived through high_school , is marked by a small plaque . At Oak Park High_School , an ornate classroom modeled after an Oxford_University reading_room bears Hemingway ' s name . School officials believe it is the most photographed classroom in America . &quot; Kids respond when they come visit the museum and see Hemingway ' s letter sweater , and view him as a person for the first time , &quot; says Jim Walwark , a veteran English_teacher at Oak Park High . &quot; But as for his writing , they find his style stilted . They don ' t find it realistic . In his day , he offered something new in literature . But to them , it ' s not new . He tried to leave things out_to reach the essence of his subject . They feel he left_out too much. &quot; Ketchum , appropriately , has no Hemingway museum . The author first came here in September , 1939 , when a public relations whiz handling the Sun Valley Lodge , the original destination ski resort , invited him to be a guest , figuring it would boost business . Hemingway accepted and rendezvoused at the lodge with Martha Gellhorn , in room 206 . ( From time to time , people still come just to stay in that room. ) Over the years , he returned frequently , usually to hunt birds , and in 1959 moved permanently to Ketchum , the town adjacent to Sun Valley . The Ram Bar at the lodge became one of his favorite drinking places , and the resort ' s Trail Creek Cabin was the scene of many wild , happy parties . On July 1 , 1961 , old beyond his years , unable to recover from electric_shock therapy prescribed for depression and a deteriorating mental condition , Hemingway ate his last meal at Ketchum ' s Christiana Restaurant . At home the next morning , he killed himself with a shotgun . Plenty of residents still remember the hulking Hemingway . &quot; He was loud and he smelled , &quot; one woman tells me at the Duchin Lounge , another Hemingway hangout . &quot; He smelled of garlic and booze. &quot; Later , she recites a Hemingway passage from memory and actually breaks_into sobs . A lode of Hemingway anecdotes can be found in the oral histories of the region collected by the Ketchum Library . Transcripts are open_to browsers . Hemingway ' s home , situated above the banks of the Big Wood River , on the west_side of town , is gated and posted with &quot; No Trespassing &quot; signs . The Nature Conservancy owns the property , and from time to time discusses opening the house for limited visits . But for now it remains harder to get_into than Cuba . Hemingway is buried in the Ketchum cemetery beneath a plain horizontal gravestone . A few miles away on the east_side of Ketchum above Sun Valley Lodge , a tasteful memorial to him has been erected . Here , on Trail Creek , in a grove of trees , rests a lonely stone bench facing a monument inscribed with an epitaph Hemingway wrote for an old hunting friend : &quot; Best of all he loved the fall , / The leaves yellow on the cottonwoods , / Leaves floating on the trout streams , / And above the_hills / The high blue windless sky. / Now he will be a part of them forever. &quot; GUIDEBOOK : On the Hemingway Trail Prices : All prices are approximate .
