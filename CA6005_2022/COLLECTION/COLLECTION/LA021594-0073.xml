   <HEADLINE> PICKING_UP THE PACE ; TOP U.S. SCORING LINE HOPES TO SHOW ITS STUFF AGAINST UP-TEMPO SLOVAKIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Todd Marchant is the playmaker , a center who prefers passing to shooting . Left_wing Craig Johnson is the digger , the dervish who spins into the corner to fight for the puck.Right wing Peter Ferraro is so natural a scorer that , according to Marchant , &quot; he just shoots and the puck finds ways to go_into the net for him. &quot; Together , the three pose the most formidable scoring threat for the U.S. Olympic team . But they had only one goal , combined , in Sunday ' s tournament-opening 4-4 tie with France , and will have to be more effective tonight against Slovakia for the U.S. team to stay in medal contention . Unlike the defense-oriented French team , Slovakia plays an up-tempo style . That means the Johnson-Marchant-Ferraro line should be in its element ; they are the three fastest U.S. skaters and were 1-2-4 in scoring in pre-Olympic play . &quot; Craig adds the power to our line because he can score goals and he can hit , &quot; said Ferraro , who scored 30 goals for the U.S. team in 60 pre-Olympic games . &quot; Todd adds good speed and I try to be somewhat creative and add scoring punch . I think we have very good line chemistry. &quot; Led by former NHL star Peter Stastny , Slovakia is seeded 12th in its Olympic debut , but has players with significant international experience . The same teams played a 5-5 tie at the Telehockey Cup tournament in Lillehammer in November . &quot; I think you ' re going to see a different offensive game from our team ( today ) , &quot; Marchant said after practice here Monday . &quot; We ' re really going_to try to bury our chances , especially on the power_play . . . . We can ' t float it in and hope it trickles through . that ' s what we were doing against France instead of taking the puck with initiative. &quot; HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
