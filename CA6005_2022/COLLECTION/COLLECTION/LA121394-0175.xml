   <HEADLINE> FATAL BOMB MAILED FROM S.F. , FBI SAYS ; CRIME : AGENTS ASK PEOPLE TO CONSIDER WHETHER ELUSIVE SERIAL BOMBER , SOUGHT FOR 16 YEARS , MAY BE SOMEONE THEY KNOW . LATEST ATTACK CLAIMED A LIFE SATURDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The package bomb that killed a prominent New York advertising executive Saturday was mailed from a mailbox here a week earlier by an elusive serial bomber whose devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated , the FBI said Monday . Frustrated investigators , who have been searching for the bomber for more_than 16 years , said the killer now may be based in the San Francisco area and urged residents to consider whether he may be someone they know . &quot; He may even appear to be a very nice guy , &quot; said Jim R . Freeman , special_agent in_charge of the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation ' s San Francisco office . &quot; He might not stand_out in a community . He could easily be the person living next door. &quot; The FBI has offered a $ 1-million reward for the capture of the bomber and , for the first time in its history , has posted a notice on the Internet appealing for leads . The bomber , believed to be a white male , has mailed or planted 15 explosive_devices spanning the continent from UC Berkeley to Yale , killing two and injuring 23 since 1978 . Many of the targets have been linked to universities , aviation and the computer_industry , prompting the FBI to code-name the case &quot; UNABOM. &quot; The bomb that killed Thomas J . Mosser at his New Jersey home Saturday was the first to target a victim in the advertising business . The FBI said it was investigating whether Mosser or his firm , Young &amp; Rubicam , Inc. , were linked to any of the other victims . &quot; This certainly adds a new wrinkle to the equation , having an advertising executive join the ranks of college professors and researchers and computer_industry executives , &quot; Freeman said . FBI_agents described the suspect as a loner with at least a high_school education and a perfectionist who is meticulous in handcrafting his explosive_devices . Since he began his attacks , his bombs have become more compact and deadly . The one mailed to Mosser was about the size of a videocassette tape . &quot; Over the period since 1978 , they have become more sophisticated and more destructive , &quot; Freeman said . Forensic experts have been able to link the bombs because of similarities in design , their painstaking construction and the initials &quot; FC &quot; found on some of the devices . In all , eight of the 15 bombs were sent through the mail ; the other seven were placed at locations where they would be discovered and detonated . The bomber began with four attacks in Illinois , targeting victims at universities and airlines . In 1981 , he moved west , with bombings in Salt_Lake_City , Berkeley , Sacramento and Auburn , Wash . During the 1980s , he also mailed bombs to professors at universities in Nashville , Tenn. , and Ann Arbor , Mich . In 1987 , a fair-skinned white_man with a mustache was seen placing a bomb at a computer_store in Salt_Lake_City . After the bomb exploded , injuring one person , the bomber stopped his attacks for six years . But in June , 1993 , a UC San Francisco geneticist was injured by a bomb mailed to his house in Tiburon . Two days later , a Yale_University computer_scientist was injured by a bomb sent to his office . After those attacks , the bomber sent a letter to the New York Times , claiming the explosions were the work of an anarchist group calling itself &quot; FC. &quot; But Freeman said Monday investigators believe they are searching for one man and have found no other indication of political motivation . Federal agencies , including the FBI and the U.S. Postal Service , formed a task_force last year based in San Francisco and are using a computer_system to analyze more_than 1 million pieces of information collected in the case . More_than 25 investigators had been working full time on the case , and the number of agents increased with the latest bombing . Freeman said investigators believe the bomber is probably in the Bay Area because of the frequency of activity here : Seven of the 15 attacks either occurred in Northern California or resulted from packages mailed from the region . The bomber ' s letter to the newspaper was mailed from Sacramento . By reconstructing the wrapping paper on the package that killed Mosser , investigators have found the return_address written_on the package and the date of the postmark , Dec . 3 . Agents also have come_up with the ZIP_code in San Francisco where the package -- bearing postage_stamps -- was mailed . &quot; We are conducting an intensive investigation here in the San Francisco area in an to attempt to determine exactly where that package may have been mailed , &quot; Freeman said . The task_force has established a hot_line for tips on the bomber : ( 800 ) 701-BOMB . The FBI also has released a new composite sketch of the suspect based on the 1987 sighting . The picture was drawn by Jeanne Boylan , the Oregon police artist whose drawing of alleged kidnaper Richard Allen Davis was widely circulated in the search last year for murder victim Polly Klaas . While appealing for help from the public , the FBI was reluctant to share much evidence in the case or offer a detailed personality profile of the suspect . &quot; I don ' t want to speculate , &quot; Freeman said at a news_conference , &quot; because I ' m not just speaking_to you in the media and to the general public , but I am also speaking probably to the UNABOM suspect. &quot; Times staff writer Ronald J . Ostrow in Washington , D.C. , contributed to this story .</TEXT>
