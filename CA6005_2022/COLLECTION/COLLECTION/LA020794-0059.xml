   <HEADLINE> MUSICAL ' FINDING HOME ' IS COMING_HOME TO SCR ; STAGE : TOURING PRODUCTION WITH MESSAGE FOR YOUNGSTERS HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE COUNTY . IT WILL BE STAGED HERE TUESDAY AND IN APRIL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A melting_pot is fine if you ' re whipping_up fondue . But asa way to mingle people of diverse cultures and values , well , the pot is basically a crock . that ' s the way Burger , the quintessential California surfer , sees things in &quot; Finding Home , &quot; South Coast Repertory ' s 1994 Educational Touring Production . Written by Michael Bigelow Dixon and SCR dramaturge Jerry Patch with music by Diane King Vann , &quot; Finding Home &quot; takes Burger ' s struggle to fit into an unfamiliar culture without sacrificing his own identity , and uses it as a parable to acquaint children with the challenges faced by local immigrants . &quot; Finding Home , &quot; which is intended for kindergarten through sixth-graders , recently began a four-month tour of Southland schools backed by a grant from the Mervyn ' s / Dayton-Hudson Foundation , underwriter of the Touring Project for the past 15 years . Two free performances for the public are scheduled : Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. on the SCR Mainstage and April 30 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center as part of the annual Imagination Celebration . For Tuesday ' s show , reservations are suggested . The musical premiered in 1984 and has been touted by SCR officials as the most talked-about show in the Touring Project ' s 25-year history . The primary reason , they say , is that until &quot; Finding Home , &quot; the touring shows centered_on larger , external themes and issues such_as communication , fitness and the computer age , and this show turned the focus inward , exploring the impact of immigration on a young_person ' s emotions . Such subsequent shows as &quot; Face 2 Face , &quot; which examined peer pressure , and last year ' s &quot; My Mom ' s Dad , &quot; a musical study in intergenerational strife , continued the trend . According to Patch ( co-author Dixon , a former literary staff_member who left SCR in the mid- ' 80s , was not involved in the revisions ) , the current version of &quot; Finding Home &quot; differs only slightly from the original : A new song was written for the finale , the musical style was funkified here and there , and the dialogue was fine-tuned to keep_up with current jargon . And yes , in case you remember the original and were wondering about them , those wacky vegetable hats are still there , although designer Dwight Richard Odle has broadened the we-are-all-growing-in-the-same-garden theme with the addition of more diverse wearable flora . In the 45-minute show , Burger rides a monster wave to the unknown and not entirely welcoming shores of Aboland , where he must navigate language , rituals and customs that are , like , totally foreign . And , because the natives are big on conformity , Burger ultimately must decide whether he will jump into the official Aboland melting_pot or hang_on to his own surfer dude identity . As Patch points_out , the subject of immigration and assimilation is more of a headline-maker today as it was in the early ' 80s . According to census figures compiled by the County of Orange Department of Immigration , more_than 63 # 000 documented foreign-born residents entered the county between 1982 and 1984 , while more_than 122 # 000 entered between 1987 and 1990 . &quot; Finding Home &quot; has been directed by John-David Keller , the SCR resident actor and director who has been staging the touring shows for 23 years , and it features four professional actors . * Keller said &quot; Finding Home &quot; is less about immigration per se as it is about values of tolerance between people of all ages and cultures . &quot; If we can express to children of elementary-school age a message of tolerance for people who are different , then we are hitting the right note at the right age , &quot; he said . &quot; The basic message is that various cultures can exist harmoniously together , rather than just be assimilated into our culture . He paused , then added with a laugh , &quot; Whatever that is. &quot; As a companion project to &quot; Finding Home &quot; in 1984 , SCR released &quot; Second Lives , &quot; a book of interviews with recent immigrants , most of them Asian or Hispanic . Before Tuesday ' s show , two of those interviewees , Chu ( Vu ) Collins and Mouachou Mounanoutoua , Laotians now employed as county social_workers , will conduct a seminar , along with a representative from the Orange County Human Relations Commission , an elementary_school principal and Keller . * &quot; Finding Home , &quot; South Coast Repertory ' s 1994 Educational Touring Production , will be performed Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. on the SCR Mainstage , 655 Town Center Drive , Costa Mesa . Also April 30 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center , 600 Town Center Drive , Costa Mesa , as part of the annual Imagination Celebration . Both performances will be free .
