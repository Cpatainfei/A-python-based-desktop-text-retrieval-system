   <HEADLINE> NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES ARE NOT ACTING VERY NEIGHBORLY ; SAN GABRIEL VALLEY : COMMUNITIES PUT UP THEIR FISTS WHEN BORDERS ARE AT STAKE . PROJECTS FROM CARD CLUBS TO FREEWAY EXTENSIONS SPUR DISPUTES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> El Monte is fighting Arcadia ; Diamond Bar and Walnut are duking it out with City of Industry . San Gabriel is headed for appeals court , nobody along the borders of Pomona is happy , and Alhambra and South Pasadena have had a feud going so_long , it makes the Hatfields and McCoys look_like pikers . It ' s a tale of many cities , of economic_growth versus peace and quiet . It ' s the story of what happens when one city ' s windfall is in another ' s back yard . In the San Gabriel Valley , 30 cities are squeezed ever more tightly as the population grows -- more_than 1.7 million now -- and buffers of empty land are eyed for development . At a time when city coffers are perilously low , the pressure to fill them sometimes sparks concern among neighboring residents that new developments will crowd them , lower property values , increase crime and traffic or compromise air and water quality . The result ? Tensions . Border disputes . Even lawsuits . &quot; There are more of them than there used to be and they are significantly more vicious , &quot; said Alan Heslop , a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College and director of the Rose Institute of State and Local_Government . Among the most volatile of San Gabriel Valley ' s feuds : * Proposals for two card clubs in Pomona prompted four neighboring cities -- Claremont , La Verne , Chino and Chino Hills -- and a citizens group to file a lawsuit demanding a full environmental impact report . Faced with a court battle , Pomona agreed . * Diamond Bar and Walnut banded_together to fight a proposed recycling_plant in a portion of the City of Industry that borders both cities , committing city funds to fight the_matter in court , and even ferrying residents on chartered buses to protests at Industry City_Hall . * Arcadia proposes to place a dump at an abandoned quarry on a remote finger of the city , far from Arcadia houses but bordering an El Monte residential neighborhood . In May , El Monte filed two suits against the city of Arcadia , one of which challenges the proposal ' s environmental impact report . * Residents of the San Gabriel Elementary School District voted two years ago to unify the district , build a high_school and return San Gabriel students , who previously attended high_school in Alhambra , to their own city . Alhambra challenged the vote_in court and won , but San Gabriel appealed . Despite the unfinished litigation , the fledgling district will be hosting its first_class of ninth-graders in temporary quarters . * Spanning generations , the conflict over the Long_Beach Freeway extension began in 1959 , when the state proposed an extension that would have split South Pasadena in two . Alhambra , which bore the brunt of traffic that spilled from the freeway onto surface streets , favored the extension . South Pasadena vehemently opposed it . In 1973 , a court injunction blocked the project on environmental grounds . The stalemate continues to this day . These are not the only conflicts , but they typify a trend among cities to step into the ring when their borders are at stake . It ' s not so_much that city borders have changed ; they just seem closer than ever . &quot; Increasing population and development has undoubtedly generated more legal contest , &quot; said Gil Smith , director of government and public affairs for the Southern California Assn . of Cities , and a former mayor and founder of the city of Carson . On top of that , Heslop said , recession and budget_cuts have dried_up local funds . &quot; Economic pressure is forcing ( cities ) into activities that are bringing them into conflict with their neighboring cities , &quot; he said . &quot; What is an economic asset for one community -- a card club or a landfill -- can be an environmental or a social threat to its neighbors. &quot; That , in turn , makes the neighbors ever more vigilant . &quot; I think you ' ll see more cities join together whenever our quality_of_life is threatened , &quot; said Eunice Ulloa , mayor of Chino , one of four cities that filed a lawsuit to force Pomona to do more extensive environmental impact reports before forging ahead with the card-club proposals . Time-consuming and expensive , EIRs are the weapon of choice when one group wants to challenge another ' s development . EIRs first came_into use in the early 1950s , Smith said , as a means of challenging highway routes that did not address the worries of affected cities . In the mid-1960s , South Pasadena hired an environmental firm to do an assessment on the Long_Beach Freeway extension , in preparation for a battle over the project ' s impact , City_Manager Ken Farfsing said . In 1970 the California Environmental Quality Act mandated the use of EIRs , and in 1973 South Pasadena sued the Department_of_Transportation to force them to conduct one . * Negotiations since then have been a volleyball_game in which Caltrans creates draft EIRs and South Pasadena bats them back with objections . To date the city has reviewed and rejected three draft EIRs , arguing that new concerns have surfaced with each draft and old concerns were never addressed . The federal Highway Administration , which would provide 85 % of the funding , will decide on the project at some point in the future . Glenn Watson , a municipal attorney whose Los Angeles firm represents 20 cities in the L.A. region including South El Monte , said vague environmental standards encourage that kind of standoff . &quot; An EIR is a document that you can ' t measure with absolute precision , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s easy to attack something as not being adequate if there ' s no precise way to measure adequacy. &quot; From serving on the battlefront in highway disputes , the EIR became the semiautomatic rifle of urban land disputes , used to scatter a wide range of accusations against plans seen as threatening . The reports now cover the impact on air and water quality , housing , jobs , access to public_services , transportation problems , infrastructure like roads and sewers , and most recently , noise , safety and crime , Smith said . Nowhere in the San Gabriel Valley have so many of those factors dovetailed into one conflict than in the fight against the proposed Materials Recovery Facility in City of Industry . Nearby residents dread the noise , glare and odor they say would be a constant nuisance from the proposed 24-hour-a-day recycling and sorting center . They worry about the health impacts of dust and air_pollution . They fear their property values may be dropping already , as prospective buyers grow wary of purchasing homes near what may soon be a trash behemoth . And they wonder if roads that join the cities would hold_up under the strain of more_than 1 # 000 truckloads a day . * Residents and officials from Walnut and Diamond Bar took_issue with City of Industry ' s preliminary environmental report , saying it failed to look_for other sites , gave inconsistent statistics on truck_traffic , and underestimated the noise_level involved . Volunteers from both cities gathered 8 # 000 signatures against the project and presented them to the City of Industry . Then in a strange twist on a political tactic more often employed by students and activists than municipal officials , the two cities jointly organized protests . On June 11 , 1 # 500 angry residents bearing picket signs reading &quot; Dump the MRF &quot; and &quot; Don ' t Trash Our City &quot; gathered near the site of the proposed facility . On June 23 , 200 of them rode buses chartered by the city of Walnut to protest at a City_Hall hearing . &quot; We thought we had to do something very drastic to bring the message to them , &quot; said Joaquim Lim , director of Walnut ' s city-sponsored MRF Task_Force . A bill sponsored by Assemblyman Paul Horcher ( R-West Covina ) that would have banned the MRF from within 2 # 000 feet of homes and forced the three cities to negotiate a joint-powers agreement , recently died . Industry officials did not return phone_calls from The Times . Another Assembly bill , sponsored by Hilda L . Solis ( D-El Monte ) , would require a joint-powers agreement to resolve the dispute between Arcadia and El Monte over the abandoned quarry . The bill has been passed_by both houses and sent to Gov . Pete Wilson . &quot; There are some unique situations where a legislator must intervene , because local_government isn ' t doing its job , or the concerns are falling on deaf ears , &quot; said Josephine Figueroa , a Solis aide . Intervening in local conflicts sometimes puts legislators in the untenable situation of being asked to resolve a problem , only to be castigated for stepping_on local authority when they do . &quot; Everybody thinks the solution to any problem is to throw it up_to the state , but once the state comes_up with a solution , all_the local officials are all upset , because it ' s another state mandate , &quot; said Ron Brand , Horcher ' s chief_of_staff . Arcadia Mayor Mary Young said she , for one , resents the intrusion . &quot; I think each city has the right to try to do what they think is right , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
