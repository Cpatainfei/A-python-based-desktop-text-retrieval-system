   <HEADLINE> DEES GOES TO COURT TO TWEAK SIMPSON ' MEDIA CIRCUS ' ; RADIO : THE KIIS DEEJAY WILL BROADCAST HIS SHOW FROM THE STEPS OF THE CRIMINAL_COURTS BUILDING TO POKE_FUN AT COVERAGE FOCUSED_ON TITILLATING DETAILS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an attempt to demonstrate that media coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder trial has turned loonier than a three-ring_circus , Rick Dees , accompanied by the Oscar Meyer Weinermobile and performers from Circus Vargas , will broadcast his KIIS-FM ( 102.7 ) morning show from the steps of the Criminal_Courts Building in downtown Los Angeles today . Paul Joseph , Dees ' producer , said that the live five-hour show , beginning at 5 a.m. , is a one-time event designed to poke_fun at all_the media from around the country and the world that will be_on hand today as jury selection for the celebrated trial commences . &quot; Our hope is to point_out how crazy the whole_thing has become , &quot; Joseph said . &quot; we ' ll be commenting not on the trial , but on the media , all_the reporters from every two-bit station in the country who are here , to see how they really feel . To see if they are just as sick_of it and yet sucked into it as we are. &quot; Joseph said that the decision to broadcast from the courthouse comes_in response to the incessant interest of the show ' s listeners to every development in the story -- a case of giving the people what they want . But he denied that the program was having it both ways : making_fun of the hoopla while piling on itself . &quot; I think if we were down there every day , you could say that then we were a part of the circus . But this is just once , &quot; he said . &quot; Believe me , I wish it were all_over with . I wish our listeners were interested in some_other kinds of comedy . I wish ( today ) was the last_day of this thing , not the first. &quot; * Dees is likely to be the only host of a local radio show on_hand live today . Local talk-radio stations said they will cover the story with news_reports for now , rather than originating entire programs from the site . But Dees will have radio company . KROQ-FM ( 106.7 ) probably won ' t send its morning team of Kevin Ryder and Gene ( Bean ) Baxter to the court , but it will have some of the program ' s regular cast of characters -- including loud-mouthed , megaphone-wielding prankster &quot; Michael the Maintenance_Man &quot; -- on_hand to stir things up , possibly to mock Dees , one of their favorite targets . &quot; We never make_fun of the murders or the judicial process , &quot; said Kevin Weatherly , KROQ ' s programming director , in response to questions about whether turning a tragedy into throwaway radio jokes is in bad taste . * &quot; We ' re there to mock the spectacle , &quot; he said . &quot; To make_fun of ourselves and what this has become . Like the T-shirt vendors and every news channel and ' Hard Copy ' and the tabloids all scrambling to get the dirt : that ' s what is humorous . The news part of it is not what we are there to mock. &quot; The Simpson case as sport or spoof continues in prime-time tonight as both &quot; Murphy Brown &quot; and &quot; Love &amp; War &quot; air tied-together episodes of a story obviously inspired by recent events . In CBS ' &quot; Murphy Brown &quot; at 9 p.m. , a famous astronaut is charged with murdering his brother and flees with police in pursuit on the New Jersey Turnpike . Meanwhile , Murphy and her news colleagues begin to investigate every angle during a live broadcast in which they find nothing much to report . Following at 9:30 p.m. , the &quot; Love &amp; War &quot; gang sits around the bar watching television and wisecracking as the astronaut leads police in a car chase down the highway . And on Thursday , a freeway pursuit again becomes comic fodder on NBC ' s &quot; Seinfeld &quot; as the character Kramer helps a former baseball star flee from police in the wake of a brutal crime .</TEXT>
