   <HEADLINE> SCHOOL ANIMAL FARM CLOSED OVER POOR CARE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An animal farm at Grant High_School was closed and the 26 animals sent to other facilities because of &quot; deplorable conditions &quot; at the campus , including filthy pens without shade that were littered with trash , officials said Friday . The animals were seized by the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals / Southern California Humane Society , whose investigators were alerted to the problems by a parent whose young child had seen a sick goat . According to the investigators , two goats were in the worst physical shape . One goat was walking on its knees . Other animals taken from the small farm included a dozen chickens , six sheep , three pigs , two goats , two ducks and a calf . &quot; This is just a horrendous educational example , &quot; said Madeline Bernstein , the executive_director of the Los Angeles SPCA / SCHS . &quot; Part of the reason you have animals on the campus is to teach care and responsibility for other living_things . When you have the opposite -- when you have conditions like this -- you ' re teaching that it ' s OK that a goat can ' t walk , that it ' s OK they ' re not regularly fed or cleaned. &quot; The animal_husbandry program no longer will be offered at the school and animals no longer will be permitted on campus , said Eve Sherman , principal at Grant . She said the teacher who oversees the farm is out of town and that she allowed the officials to remove the animals . &quot; We basically relinquished them ( the animals ) because they weren ' t getting the care they should have -- especially during the summer , &quot; Sherman said . &quot; The facility just wasn ' t prepared_for them -- that ' s really the biggest part of it . We feel we ' ve taken_care of it in a responsible manner. &quot; The school had been cited by the city two years ago for problems with the animal pens and told to remove the litter and debris . Sherman , who has been principal at the school for a year , said she knew of the previous problems but that she was giving the teacher a second chance . &quot; When you ' re new , you give everyone the benefit of the doubt , a fair shake , &quot; Sherman said . &quot; But I ' m very disturbed by this . I ' m an animal lover and I don ' t want anything to happen. &quot; The school avoided criminal charges because the animals were relinquished and no more animals will be kept at the facility , officials said . Grant ' s animal_husbandry program was small and was part of a bigger , horticultural program , Sherman said . The farm facility now will be used for the horticultural classes . The animals were supposed to be cared_for during the summer but that responsibility obviously had been shirked , Sherman said . She said she plans to investigate the situation further with teachers . Children who attend a summer program at Valley College , adjacent to the Grant campus , noticed the animals through a fence , Bernstein said . She said the children were upset when they saw the goat that couldn ' t walk , and one of the mothers called her . &quot; The goat is 1 # 000 % better with simple veterinary treatment , &quot; Bernstein said . &quot; It absolutely is a shame . Kids really benefit a lot from taking_care of animals . &quot; You do so_much more damage when you allow this to happen. &quot;</TEXT>
