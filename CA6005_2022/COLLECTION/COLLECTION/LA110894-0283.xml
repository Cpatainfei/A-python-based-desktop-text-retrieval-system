   <HEADLINE> WILSON AND BROWN CAP LONG , GRUELING RACE ; POLITICS : CONFIDENT GOVERNOR CAMPAIGNS FOR FELLOW REPUBLICANS . OPPONENT PRESSES FOR DEFEAT OF PROP . 187 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The long and often contentious battle for governor ended Monday with Democrat Kathleen Brown urging Californians to cast_aside the negativity and divisiveness she said was symbolized by Gov . Pete Wilson , and the Republican incumbent asking voters to give him four more years to lead a sprawling and troubled state . Wilson , while maintaining a cautious public visage , was confident enough to spend the day before the election campaigning for other Republicans , stopping off in several key legislative districts to help buttress get-out-the-vote efforts and taking along with him members of the state GOP ticket . The personal campaigning followed a $ 525 # 000 donation from Wilson ' s campaign treasury to a united Republican effort that bought television commercials on behalf of several party candidates -- underscoring Wilson ' s belief that his own victory is assured . So confident was the governor at several rallies that he did not even mention Brown ' s name , instead firing at President Clinton as though he were Wilson ' s opponent . The governor specifically slammed Clinton for opposing Proposition 187 , which would deny public education and non-emergency state services to illegal immigrants . Clinton campaigned against the measure -- and for state Democratic candidates -- Friday in Los Angeles and Saturday in Oakland . &quot; Here we have seen the President come_out and pretend he ' s doing an adequate job on illegal immigration , &quot; Wilson told a rally at the Newport Harbor Republican Women ' s Headquarters in Newport Beach . Washington , he said &quot; is sticking California for the cost of their failure of controlling the border. &quot; At a later rally in Bellflower , Wilson ' s attack was laced with the kind of rhetoric that Democrats often have used this year against the governor himself . &quot; I think ( Clinton ) has given us a new reason for California to distrust him : Anyone who will stoop so low as_to deliberately be a demagogue and inject race into a proposition that is instead about fairness -- that we do not need , &quot; the governor said in Bellflower , at the second of four rallies that culminated in his traditional election eve party in San Diego . Brown , the state_treasurer , spent most of her day pressing voters to turn_back Proposition 187 and its most prominent supporter , Wilson . As she has in recent weeks , Brown exuded a new-found assurance and drew cheers at each stop . &quot; We have the most marvelous opportunity . . . to send a message that says we understand that in diversity is our strength and in unity we will find power , &quot; Brown declared at an open-air rally at Cal State Northridge . &quot; These politicians who have the gall to repeat our history , &quot; she said , referring to past incidents of discrimination against ethnic_groups in California , &quot; will feel our wrath because we will say no to them and we will say no to Proposition 187. &quot; Later in the day , Brown capped her campaign on a surreal note , being pelted with catcalls as she appeared live_on the &quot; Geraldo &quot; television_show to lobby against Proposition 187 . She later described the interlude as &quot; wild. &quot; &quot; It ' s what Proposition 187 unleashes , &quot; she said . &quot; It unleashes anger and passion . It unleashes them in a way that I think is risky for California. &quot; For both candidates , Monday was the final exhausting day of years-long efforts to capture the governor ' s office . Together , they had collected more_than $ 47.5 million in donations by Oct . 22 -- before additional millions were spent on television ads -- and they have spent virtually all_of it . In Brown ' s case , she apparently has spent herself into debt , and a lack of money forced her to take commercials off the air over the weekend . She had only a small presence on the airwaves on Monday , campaign officials said . For Wilson , a victory today would cap a remarkable come-back that began more_than a year ago when he was more_than 20 points down in the polls , blamed by voters for the state ' s foundering economy and a sense of foreboding about California ' s once-limitless future . Victory would place him on the short_list for Republican presidential candidates for 1996 -- a race he said he will not enter , even if he did sound surprisingly like a Clinton opponent on Monday . A Brown success would make her the third star in a family triumvirate unprecedented in American politics , joining her father , Edmund G . ( Pat ) Brown Sr. , and her brother , Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr. , as occupants of the governor ' s office . It would vault her into national political orbit as well , and mean that she achieved the prize under the most difficult of circumstances , with a come-from-behind win_over a crafty and well-financed incumbent . Wilson closed_out his campaign with appearances in key legislative districts in San Jose , Bellflower , Orange County and San Diego . In Bellflower , where he sought to hike the chances of Republican Assembly candidate Phil Hawkins , he was greeted with chants of &quot; Pete , Pete ! &quot; and &quot; Four more years ! &quot; The governor ' s address there was crafted , in his words , to &quot; run_up the score &quot; against Democrats . He went so far as_to suggest that &quot; enlightened Democrats &quot; change parties . &quot; I ' ve got a particular message for those who are Democrats , &quot; he said . &quot; You are welcome . You are welcome not just in this headquarters , you are welcome in this party because in fact there are a lot of right-thinking Democrats who reject the kind of liberal nonsense which for two decades has cost California dearly . &quot; It has meant that instead of being a safe and civilized society , we ' ve had people not safe in their own homes and their own places of work . That is dangerous nonsense and we are going_to end it . And we are going_to continue the change that we have begun. &quot; Wilson joked later that Clinton &quot; seems obsessed about California. &quot; &quot; Well , I predict that he will lose_it in 1996 , &quot; he said . Brown traveled_to two college rallies , and closed_out her final day of more_than two years of campaigning with a visit to a Reseda Jewish home for the aging and the &quot; Geraldo &quot; appearance . In between the events , she chatted with talk_show hosts in seven California cities . To one , she expressed optimism about today ' s vote . &quot; The battle goes well , &quot; she said . &quot; I feel very positive . It is too close to call. &quot; The &quot; Geraldo &quot; show , among other things , tested Brown ' s calm under_fire as the treasurer was insulted right and left during the program . It got so bad at one point that host Geraldo Rivera cautioned , &quot; This is a debate . This is not a rumble. &quot; One white_man rose and told Brown his son-in-law was denied a job as a police_officer because he does not speak Spanish . &quot; Talk_about discrimination , Kathleen ! What are you going_to do about it ? &quot; he screamed . When Brown told the audience that she believes illegal immigrants come_to California for jobs -- and thus sanctions against their employers would be helpful -- some screamed , &quot; Welfare , welfare. &quot; Said Brown : &quot; Proposition 187 simply unleashes these emotions that are very hard to put_back into the bottle. &quot; Earlier in the day , at calmer venues , Brown continued her effort to persuade voters that Wilson represents a negative approach to governing , and that his endorsement of Proposition 187 has emotionally split the state . &quot; I ' m so tired_of politicians who play_on hate , who play_on fear , who play_on frustration , &quot; she said . &quot; We will prevail tomorrow and we will take_back California. &quot; Times staff writer Nancy Hsu contributed to this story . Inside the Ads GOVERNOR ' S RACE Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown ran two final television commercials Monday dealing with her Republican opponent , Gov . Pete Wilson , and Proposition 187 , the controversial ballot measure Wilson supports that would deny state-financed health , education and social benefits to foreign nationals living_in California illegally . Brown opposes the ballot initiative . * THE ADS : One ad urges voters to take a second look &quot; at the politician behind &quot; Proposition 187 . It says that as a U.S. senator , Wilson &quot; took $ 600 # 000 ( from ) corporations that wanted illegal labor , then protected them from INS raids. &quot; The commercial goes_on to allege that Wilson voted to make Californians finance health_care for illegal immigrants and &quot; wrote the law that let 1.3 million illegals across the border. &quot; ' A number of the statements are credited to an article in the San Jose Mercury News . The second ad contends that &quot; Pete Wilson has a scary plan &quot; to force all Americans to carry &quot; mandatory &quot; ID cards . It says Wilson wants doctors , nurses and teachers to turn_in students who do not have cards &quot; and neighbors to report on neighbors. &quot; The commercial continues : &quot; Brown says Wilson ' s ID cards are un-American. &quot; * THE ANALYSIS : Wilson has made Proposition 187 a centerpiece of his reelection campaign , but was not an originator of the initiative . The Mercury News_article said Wilson election committees received $ 600 # 000 in campaign contributions from agribusinesses and other interests that may have benefited from low-cost foreign workers . Wilson sponsored legislation in 1986 that provided_for the legal entry of foreign farm_workers , but also required them to return to their home countries . The bill was amended in the U.S. House to allow them to achieve legal residence -- a provision Wilson now says he opposed , but was forced to accept . The law allowed about 1.3 million immigrants to work in the United States , about half of them in California . They did not enter the country illegally . Since 1990 , when Wilson said that his amendment assured California growers a continuing supply of legal workers to harvest crops , Wilson has become a sharp critic of the costs to the state of illegal immigrants . Wilson says his position has evolved as more and more illegal immigrants have come_into California and the cost of providing services to them has increased , in part because of the recession . As for the second ad , the idea of some sort of a national identification card has been proposed for a variety of uses over the years and generally was opposed by civil libertarians as smacking too_much of a police_state . Wilson has said , however , that some sort of identification system would be required if Proposition 187 passed because only legal residents of the United States would be eligible for non-emergency health_care , public schooling and other social_services . Wilson once answered that everyone would have to carry an ID card , but later said he had not heard the word &quot; carry &quot; in the question . He then said everyone would have to have a card , but would only need to possess it on occasions such_as applying for a job or being admitted to a school . Brown has said that everyone must have a &quot; tamper-proof &quot; Social_Security card to present as evidence of citizenship or legal residence when applying for a job . Wilson has insisted that he does not &quot; want &quot; doctors , teachers and others to turn_in suspected illegal residents . However , the language of the initiative would require those officials to report an illegal immigrant or suspected illegal immigrant to authorities . The initiative itself does not establish an identification card or other means of identity , but says verification of legal_status &quot; may include , but shall not be limited to , questioning the person regarding his or her date and place_of_birth , and entry into the United States , and demanding documentation to indicate his or her legal status. &quot; The proposed law requires certain officials to report suspected illegal immigrants to authorities in the course of their jobs , but says nothing about requiring &quot; neighbors to report neighbors. &quot; SENATE_RACE * Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington released a new television commercial late Monday . * THE AD : The commercial features Huffington speaking_to a camera . He says , &quot; It ' s time for a new beginning . A new generation of leaders , a new vision for our country . Do we dare break trust with our children and leave them a country that has lost direction ? I ' m running_for Senate to change the system , to make_it work for you -- not the special_interests . And to restore the values of faith , family , hard work and responsibility that have made this country great . I ' m Mike Huffington and I need your vote. &quot; * THE ANALYSIS : Political observers say it is rare for a candidate to release a new commercial on election eve . This one continues a theme that Huffington has tried to emphasize on television in the last week , offering voters a brief vision of the candidate ' s hopes and concerns . The Senate_race has been dominated by nasty attack television commercials in which both candidates have tried to tell voters why they should not support their opponent . This new ad seeks to give voters a reason to favor Huffington . INSURANCE COMMISSIONER * Assemblyman Charles W . Quackenbush , the Republican candidate for insurance commissioner , began airing a new television commercial at the end of last week . Most of the ad is devoted to criticism of Sen . Art Torres , the Democrat in the race . * THE AD : &quot; Chuck Quackenbush . In the Legislature , he authored the &quot; insurance consumers ' bill of rights &quot; and as insurance commissioner , he ' ll enforce it . His opponent , Art Torres , 20 years in the Legislature . He ' s the king of special_interests , lavish travel paid_for by lobbyists . And he ' s taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from unions and criminal defense_lawyers . He ' s taken_over $ 200 # 000 from insurance industry sources . After he said he would n ' t . For insurance commissioner , the choice is clear. &quot; * THE ANALYSIS : Quackenbush ' s bill for an ombudsman -- a consumer watchdog -- in the state Insurance Department died in committee . When Torres sponsored a separate ombudsman bill , Quackenbush voted against it . It was vetoed by Gov . Pete Wilson . Quackenbush says he will have an ombudsman with or without legislation . Torres says that without legislation , there is no money for one in the departmental budget . The Quackenbush campaign says Torres received $ 231 # 000 in gifts , travel and speaking engagement honorariums over a 17-year period in the Legislature , or a little less than $ 13 # 600 a year . This does not make Torres &quot; the king of special_interests , &quot; since others have received more . As for contributions from unions , it is common for Democrats such_as Torres to receive contributions from unions , which in any case are not regulated by the insurance commissioner . The charge that contributions come from &quot; criminal defense_lawyers &quot; refers to &quot; California Trial_Lawyers , &quot; campaign aides say . Trial_lawyers , in fact , are generally plaintiffs ' lawyers and not criminal defense_attorneys . The Torres campaign acknowledges that it has accepted more_than $ 200 # 000 from &quot; insurance industry sources , &quot; but points_out that almost all_the money comes from lawyers and others who are not regulated by the department . What the Quackenbush ad does not mention is that Quackenbush has received at least $ 2 million in industry money , and mainly from insurance_companies , agents and brokers , who are regulated by the commissioner .
