   <HEADLINE> NO MAGIC FOR SALADIN ; MCCULLOUGH ' S TOP WISH IS TO PLAY FOR USC , BUT IT ' S BEEN NO CARPET RIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a crisp October Saturday , perfect for football , yet it was obvious the best player on the field at Santa Ana Stadium would rather have been elsewhere . Saladin McCullough , No . 4 , stood detached from events on the sideline , his Pasadena City College helmet tucked between his right arm and rib_cage . Among the most heralded football prospects in recent years , a runner likened in hushed tones by some to Gale Sayers , McCullough had to wait out a one-quarter suspension for missing a practice without permission before PCC ' s game against Rancho Santiago . Once in the backfield , in his fluid , almost ho-hum manner , McCullough flashed the skills that have been dropping jaws since the runner ' s days at Pasadena Muir High . Although he missed a quarter on offense -- he was allowed to return kicks -- McCullough gained 128 yards in 17 carries in an otherwise dreary and error-plagued PCC loss to Rancho Santiago . What was a player with such gifts doing_in this game , in this half-empty stadium , in this conference , in these circumstances ? McCullough asks himself often . In his mind , Oct . 29 should have been spent relaxing in a dormitory across town during USC ' s bye weekend as the Trojans awaited their next game against Washington State . McCullough is so disappointed not to be a USC tailback he says he found it difficult to watch his favorite team play . &quot; Because , &quot; McCullough explained , &quot; that ' s supposed to be me. &quot; That McCullough is not a sophomore at USC has to do with his 1992 Scholastic Aptitude Test score while he was at Muir . After McCullough had committed to attend USC , anonymous Muir teachers challenged his SAT score of 1 # 200 , a dramatic improvement -- too dramatic , the skeptics claimed -- from his earlier score in the preliminary SAT . The Educational Testing Service ( ETS ) invalidated McCullough ' s result , offering him a chance to retake the test . McCullough refused , and steadfastly maintains his innocence . &quot; I just think there were some jealous people who were jealous of me because I was going ( to USC ) , &quot; McCullough , 19 , said . &quot; I guess they just didn ' t want to see me do something with my life . They ' d rather see me stuck here with them. &quot; After taking a year off from school , McCullough resurfaced at PCC with a new game_plan : to obtain his associate of arts degree in three semesters and transfer to a four-year university . His heart is still set_on USC . &quot; Just trying to get_to university , really , &quot; McCullough said when asked of his goals . McCullough ' s foray_into community_college football was , not surprisingly , a spectacular success . In seven games , he scored nine touchdowns and led the Mission Conference , averaging 231 all-purpose yards a game . He finished as the team ' s leading rusher with 725 yards in 128 carries . Unlike football defenders , however , McCullough couldn ' t shake the cloud of controversy that follows him off the field . &quot; Everyone ' s walking light because of Saladin , &quot; one PCC administrator said . Maybe not for long . According to Robert Lewis , the school ' s sports information director , McCullough quit the football_team with two games remaining , citing &quot; personal reasons. &quot; McCullough is still believed to be enrolled in classes at PCC , but there is talk that he will transfer , possibly to El Camino College in Torrance , before next season . &quot; The rumor mill is flying_on that one , &quot; Lewis said . To date , McCullough has not behaved like one eager to tidy_up his academic or personal standing . * McCullough was twice suspended from the team for disciplinary reasons . Coach Dennis Gossard benched McCullough on Oct . 8 for PCC ' s game against Mt . San Antonio College for fighting at practice . According to the campus police report , the fight on Oct . 3 pitted Saladin and Hassan , his older brother and teammate , against a sophomore defensive back from the San Fernando Valley . In the report , a PCC assistant coach said that another player , not involved in the fight , &quot; was bragging that players from the Valley had better watch_out because they are in the Pasadena area , where local Pasadena-Altadena gangs dominate. &quot; All three players were suspended for a game . Gossard said it was an isolated incident and Pasadena police said McCullough was not involved in gangs . &quot; He got_in a fight , &quot; the coach said of McCullough . &quot; I don ' t like people fighting. &quot; McCullough offered his version : &quot; I felt we shouldn ' t have got suspended , &quot; he said . &quot; It was a team thing . It should stay_on the field . The coaches should have handled it . But things happen for a reason , so you won ' t make that mistake again . I won ' t do nothing stupid like that again. &quot; Michael Harrison , McCullough ' s uncle and former legal_guardian , said the fight involving his nephews was &quot; blown_out of proportion &quot; and is angered by innuendoes about Saladin . &quot; He ' s always been a kid who ' s had a bad rap , for no reason. &quot; Harrison said . &quot; He does stay to himself , doesn ' t talk much . When you don ' t express yourself , people will assume a lot of things. &quot; McCullough ' s suspension followed hard on the heels of his best performance of the season . He had just totaled 320 all-purpose yards in a 42-41 loss to Fullerton College . But in the week before the Rancho Santiago game , McCullough was suspended again , this time for one quarter . An administration source said McCullough left practice , complaining of illness , but failed to get the necessary clearance from the team trainer . Before the season , Pasadena Police Sgt . Phlunte Riddle , a member of the department ' s Neighborhood Crime Task_Force , had been asked by the PCC athletic department to speak_to the football coaching staff about how increased gang tensions in the community might affect a team with players from vastly disparate neighborhoods . The caution , it turns_out , was warranted . On Oct . 19 , an unconscious PCC student was dragged into the trainer ' s room by a PCC football_player . In the police report , a PCC coach said he had overheard talk among players that a PCC player &quot; beat_up the victim because he did not like the victim fraternizing with another gang. &quot; On Oct . 28 , police investigated a fight between two players at the men ' s gym with &quot; one of the subjects brandishing a knife , &quot; the police report stated . Gossard said team tensions are merely reflective of the times . &quot; Society has a problem , &quot; Gossard said . &quot; We ' re just like every_other football_team in the country. &quot; Although neither of the latter two incidents involved Saladin McCullough , his presence caused concern for PCC officials . Because McCullough was a star attraction , Riddle said , the athletic department feared that an increase in_attendance at PCC home_games might lead to problems in the stands . &quot; An individual player may or may_not be a ( gang ) member , but the associates of that player could come and , what they call ' See their homeboy play , ' that could be a problem , &quot; Riddle said . &quot; He ' s from the community , and he is an excellent player , &quot; Riddle said . &quot; So everyone has such heightened expectations of him , they may want to come and see him play . And those persons ( might ) create a problem. &quot; Indeed , the Oct . 1 home opener against Fullerton drew an estimated 2 # 000 fans , large by PCC standards . The team stadium holds 2 # 500 and the school does not keep attendance records . Security was beefed_up for the game , Riddle said , but there were no major problems in the stands . Ernie Romine , PCC ' s athletic director , said special precautions were taken , but not because of McCullough . &quot; Because ( McCullough is ) on our team is not the reason we had to take additional security measures , &quot; Romine said . &quot; We took additional security measures because it ' s 1994 , and society is the way it is. &quot; On the field , as usual , McCullough did not disappoint . He scored four touchdowns . * McCullough the student has not fared as well . Interviewed in late October , McCullough said he was taking 16 units , including a course in pre-algebra , Math 125 . He said he hoped to complete the necessary 48 units to transfer in three semesters , which he said will require attending summer school . Because his high_school SAT test score was invalidated , McCullough entered college as a nonqualifier under NCAA rules and must obtain his associate ' s degree to transfer to a four-year school . &quot; I ' m doing_good , attending all my classes , &quot; he said at the time . Actually , McCullough had been dropped from his Math 125 class earlier in the semester because of poor attendance , according to the teacher , who asked not to be identified . McCullough was also dropped from the Program for Academic Support Services ( PASS ) , a federal program designed to assist students who require special academic attention . Charles Clay , director of PASS , said McCullough failed to comply with a study agreement reached by the player , Gossard and PASS . &quot; The agreement broke_down , &quot; Clay said . &quot; We ' re trying to work with Saladin , but I don ' t know . . . . Maybe my program wasn ' t the best program for him. &quot; Gossard , in his eighth season as PCC coach , said there is only so_much a coach can do . &quot; He ' s one of 80 guys I have to stay_on , &quot; Gossard said . &quot; Every kid is told every day : Please go_to class . Get your education . that ' s why we ' re here. &quot; Harrison , who became Saladin ' s guardian when McCullough ' s father died in 1986 , says he is partly to blame for some of his nephew ' s first-semester missteps . A history teacher at Muir , Harrison said he has not been able to devote as much time to McCullough since being named interim football_coach at Muir this fall . &quot; Some things just kind of got -- not out of hand -- but I was not_able to keep the eye that he needs as a young_man at his age , &quot; Harrison said . But Harrison also said the buck stops with McCullough . &quot; He is the person that is totally responsible_for his future , &quot; his uncle said . &quot; He has all_the backup that he needs , and he has the supporting cast . He has to make a conscious effort to do_it himself. &quot; * In the decades-old office where Jackie Robinson , another talented prospect and PCC student , once sat with his coaches , Gossard wondered what course McCullough would choose to follow . &quot; The guy as an athlete cannot miss , &quot; Gossard said after recent practice . &quot; can ' t miss . That would be the tragedy , if he does. &quot; A Pasadena baseball scout once clocked McCullough from home to first_base in 3.6 seconds -- Rickey Henderson fast . The scout recalled a game in which McCullough walked , stole second on the first pitch , third_base on the second pitch and scored on a passed ball on the fourth pitch . And never slid . &quot; Rocket Ismail speed , &quot; the scout said . Had McCullough shown interest in track , he probably could have rewritten records on Muir ' s star-studded sprint team . For fun , McCullough used to race classmates in the corridors at lunchtime . A baseball outfielder , McCullough was drafted by the Kansas City Royals , but his first love always has been football . He is not a track man who plays football . Those who know say he possesses the instincts of a great back . Though smallish at 5 feet 9 and 173 pounds , McCullough is a tough enough inside runner who seems to melt into holes and emerge at full speed . &quot; I ' ve been in this business 40 years , coaching football , &quot; Jim Brownfield , McCullough ' s high_school coach , said . &quot; I ' ve never seen a kid , no less had one , who could do what this kid could do three yards past the line_of_scrimmage . When he gets three yards past the line_of_scrimmage , it ' s unbelievable , like Gale Sayers . You can ' t judge his speed. &quot; During his senior year at Muir , McCullough rushed for 2 # 142 yards and scored 36 touchdowns . Against Fullerton on Oct . 1 , McCullough gained 73 yards in 19 carries , had seven catches for 73 yards , returned three kickoffs for 128 yards , including a 98-yard return for touchdown , and returned three punts for 46 yards . &quot; We pounded the hell out of him , 42-41 , &quot; Fullerton College Coach Gene Murphy said facetiously . &quot; We let him get all his yards and shut him down the last 41 seconds. &quot; Murphy says McCullough belongs in a higher league . &quot; He kind of reminds me of ( Garrison ) Hearst , &quot; Murphy said , referring to the former University of Georgia All-American now with the Arizona Cardinals . &quot; He ' s not as big , but I ' m talking_about changing directions , stopping on a dime and leaving nine cents change , running east and west as fast as he runs north and south. &quot; Gossard said McCullough has not been difficult to coach but has been critical of the way he is being used in the offense , preferring to run from the I-formation rather than Gossard ' s single-back set . &quot; I don ' t think I would have went here if I knew they were going_to be in this type of offense , &quot; McCullough said . Gossard said his offense was best utilizing the player ' s all-around talents as a runner and receiver . &quot; It ' s not like he ' s not getting the ball ! &quot; Gossard exclaimed . Gossard said he is not offended that McCullough appears to be biding his time at PCC . &quot; No kid has ever planned to be here , &quot; Gossard said . &quot; They all want to be at four-year schools. &quot; But will McCullough get there ? Some question whether the player will realize his potential . They see a young_man at the crossroads . It remains McCullough ' s dream to play_at USC , yet some privately believe he would be better_off attending a university out of state , away from the scrutiny that would no doubt follow him to the USC campus . &quot; If he went_to another school , I think he ' d enjoy it , &quot; Brownfield , his high_school coach , said . &quot; The experience of going somewhere else would be valuable. &quot; Gossard said , &quot; I ' d like to see him do anything he wants . I want to see him get his AA , get the hell out of here , I don ' t care where he chooses. &quot; Harrison said his nephew is still &quot; hell-bent &quot; on USC but admits there ' s a difference between wanting and being accepted . &quot; He has to take_care of business academically , &quot; Harrison said . &quot; He ' s aware of that , he knows that ' s necessary for him to reach the next level. &quot; McCullough has not thought much beyond USC , but said he probably would leave the state if he couldn ' t get his first wish . &quot; that ' s where I want to be at , playing running back at SC , &quot; McCullough said . &quot; I just like it . I don ' t know ( why ) . I grew_up liking it . I like ( Coach ) John Robinson. &quot; Robinson , of course , liked McCullough enough to offer him a scholarship out of high_school . What now ? The USC coach has been vague about McCullough , who would not be available to the Trojans until the 1996 season . &quot; We can ' t even look_at him until next year , &quot; Robinson said . Robinson added that he obviously would be interested in any quality player who qualified for admittance . However , another in the USC athletic department , who asked not to be named , said he would &quot; be shocked &quot; if McCullough ended_up at the school . McCullough is more optimistic . &quot; I like SC , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m hoping they ' ll want me. &quot;</TEXT>
