   <TEXT> It seems a historic step for the countries of the Pacific region to promise to move toward free_trade by the year 2020 . But how far-reaching is the new trade pact ? There are at least two reasons for some skepticism about the impact of what President Clinton and the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum -- including Japan , China , South_Korea , Canada and Australia -- pledged to do Tuesday . The first is that , for now , the agreement represents a promise with nothing behind it . There are no methods for enforcing free_trade . If one country wants to preserve its trade_barriers , none of the other Pacific nations can do anything about it . A defiant leader can merely come_up with his own adaptation of the old line &quot; How many divisions does the Pope have ? &quot; The other problem , of course , is that 2020 is a long way off . It was relatively easy for the leaders to pledge to eliminate trade_barriers by that time , because few if any of them will be in office 26 years from now . Indeed , some American critics have argued that setting such a distant target date could actually hamper the process of reducing trade_barriers now . &quot; If ( APEC ) doesn ' t break any new ground and becomes instead a kind of comfortable base for saying , ' Oh well , we promise that we ' re going to get something done_in 2020 , so hang_in there and don ' t beat_up on us bilaterally . . . and certainly don ' t build any more on the North_American Free_Trade Agreement and allow any other countries in , ' then you ' re not moving the process along , &quot; Paul Stern of the Washington-based Progressive Policy Institute said in a recent speech . Those who first proposed the year 2020 believe the goal is , by itself , important . &quot; It ' s not quite as long off as it sounds , &quot; C . Fred Bergsten , director of the Institute for International Economics and a member of the APEC advisory group that first set the 2020 target , told one Washington audience last month . &quot; . . . Moreover , we felt that in practice , the actual achievement of the liberalization would almost certainly occur much faster than the negotiated target date. &quot; On Tuesday , President Clinton compared the goal of Asian-Pacific free_trade by 2020 to President John F . Kennedy ' s statement in 1961 that he wanted the United States to send a man to the moon in a decade . In both cases , an Administration official said , visionaries set a target &quot; not knowing at that time whether or not that goal could be achieved . But the goal itself propelled the effort. &quot; There are also disagreements about the extent to which the 2020 target date is good for the United States . Bergsten insists that it is . &quot; All of the countries in the region , outside North_America in particular , have lots of trade_barriers , and we don ' t have very many , &quot; he says . &quot; So moving to totally free_trade in the region means an enormous competitive gain to the United States. &quot; But then , there is the problem of that long lead time . It could make APEC , one critic suggested , &quot; a red flag for protectionists in the United States. &quot; &quot; Here we are . We ' re going to deal with the two largest pools of cheap labor in the world , China and Indonesia , and they don ' t have to reciprocate ( by lowering trade_barriers ) for 10 or 15 years . They can just run_up surpluses , &quot; said Robert Manning , another senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute . &quot; It ( the 2020 date ) could have a very counterproductive , unintended consequence. &quot; The best argument on behalf of the deadline is that it forges at least some new economic links , however weak , between the United States and Asia . &quot; We could never walk away from the Asian market , &quot; Clinton said at a news_conference . &quot; We should be walking towards it , in terms that are fair. &quot; The strong American support for APEC over the past five years has been based on the fear that the nations of East Asia might move to form their own intra-Asian trade bloc -- one that might include Japan but leave_out the United States . Malaysian Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammed , in particular , has been pushing for an intra-Asian grouping , which could turn_into a trade bloc dominated by the Japanese yen . APEC -- first proposed by Australia and then backed by the United States -- includes Canada , New Zealand , Mexico and Chile , all nations that are outside Asia but that border_on the Pacific . In setting the date far in the future , the United States succeeded in keeping everyone ' s attention focused_on APEC -- the larger , more inclusive grouping . But in_order to do so , it had to agree to that date . The reality is that for now at least , Asian governments are leery of doing anything stronger than setting the vague goal of free_trade by 2020 . Many Asian_countries are afraid of &quot; additional pressure from the United States to reduce trade_barriers too quickly , as well as pressure ( from America ) about national policies dealing with such sensitive areas as human_rights , intellectual property_rights and the environment , &quot; said the East-West Center of Honolulu in a recent study .</TEXT>
