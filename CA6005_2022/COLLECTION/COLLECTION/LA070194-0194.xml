   <HEADLINE> SENATE PANEL VOTES 4-0 FOR EXPULSION OF HILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state Senate ' s governing committee voted Thursday to expel veteran Sen . Frank Hill , a Whittier Republican who has refused to leave_office despite his conviction on three felony charges two weeks ago . The recommendation of the Rules Committee went_to the full Senate , where a final vote is expected next week . The action came as public pressure mounted for lawmakers to deal as toughly with Hill as they do when passing bills that crack_down on street criminals . Hill , who would become the first senator expelled since 1905 , when four members were thrown_out in the wake of a criminal scandal , did not attend the brief hearing and was not available for comment . A 40-year-old married father of three , Hill was found guilty June 16 by a federal_court jury of extortion , money-laundering and conspiracy stemming from his acceptance in 1988 of a $ 2 # 500 payment from an undercover FBI_agent seeking a legislative favor . Sen . Leroy Greene ( D-Carmichael ) , chairman of the Ethics Committee , urged Rules Committee_members to put aside their personal affection for Hill and to vote to oust him as the ethically and morally correct course of action . Greene said he found the task of ousting &quot; an honored and valued &quot; colleague distasteful . The committee voted 4 to to recommend Hill ' s ouster to the full Senate . Committee_member Sen . Nicholas C . Petris ( D-Oakland ) abstained_from voting . Petris , an attorney , said Hill should be allowed to remain in office at least until Sept . 12 , when he is scheduled to be sentenced and a federal judge will rule on Hill ' s bid to set_aside the verdict . &quot; I personally don ' t feel you ' ve had your day in court until the conclusion of proceedings , &quot; Petris told the committee . Greene acknowledged that there were valid legal arguments in Hill ' s favor but asserted that from a &quot; moral and ethical &quot; standpoint , &quot; I see no choice but to recommend to you that Sen . Hill be expelled. &quot; The last time the Rules Committee faced a similar issue was in 1990 when Sen . Joseph B . Montoya was convicted of felony corruption charges . The committee stripped him of his committee chairmanships . He left within a week . Hill was stripped of his committee assignments shortly after the verdicts were returned . But because he is highly popular , senators were reluctant to force his ouster . As a result , Hill last week filed a letter of resignation , but he refused to leave until he is sentenced . Meantime , he has continued to collect his $ 52 # 500-a-year salary and tax-free expense allowance . Statewide elected officials convicted of felonies must leave_office when they are sentenced . However , no such requirement applies to state legislators . The state Constitution empowers each house to determine the suitability of its members , who can be expelled only by a two-thirds vote . Senate GOP Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno , who had talked with Hill , said Hill told him in_advance of the Rules Committee vote that he would resign before Sept . 12 rather than subject his colleagues to an expulsion fight in the full Senate . &quot; It ' s not going_to come_up on the floor , &quot; Maddy said . &quot; Frank is going_to resign. &quot; Sen . Ruben Ayala ( D-Chino ) , a member of the Rules Committee , said senators were under heavy constituent and newspaper editorial pressure to oust Hill . He said voters have accused senators of &quot; coddling one of_your_own . As far as they are concerned , Hill is a convicted felon . Why keep him on the payroll ? &quot;</TEXT>
