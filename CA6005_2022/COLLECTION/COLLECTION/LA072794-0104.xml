   <HEADLINE> HUBER BELIEVED ORIGINALLY HELD IN REFRIGERATOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A police affidavit and diagram filed_in court here Tuesday indicate that Denise Huber may have been killed and her body kept_in an upright refrigerator-freezer in an Orange County warehouse until the man accused of killing her purchased a larger deep_freeze . The documents , filed_in a Yavapai County court with a request for a third warrant to search the home of murder_suspect John J . Famalaro , may explain the mystery of Huber ' s whereabouts in the nine days that passed between her disappearance and when her accused killer took delivery of the deep_freeze in which her body was discovered three years later . One Arizona law_enforcement official confirmed that investigators theorize that Huber ' s body may have been stored in the side-by-side refrigerator-freezer that Famalaro kept_in the Laguna Hills warehouse , but cautioned that evidence was thus far lacking to prove the theory . &quot; The theory is being looked_at , &quot; the official said . &quot; But when it comes_down to putting_on the case , you can only prove what you can prove . What really happened may never really be known . There were no eyeball witnesses. &quot; &quot; Since the issuance of the ( third ) search_warrant , ( Yavapai Sheriff Deputy Lonnie E . Brown ) has been advised of information that leads to the belief that the Hotpoint refrigerator may have been involved in the death of Denise Huber , &quot; states the affidavit filed with the search_warrant request . Special tests to detect whether there was blood on or in the refrigerator-freezer did not reveal any traces , even though bloodstains had been found all around the area where the refrigerator-freezer had stood_in the warehouse . Tests have yet to be conducted on lumber and other wooden materials that were thought to be near the refrigerator-freezer while it was in the warehouse . Several truckloads of lumber and wooden siding were seized in Tuesday ' s search . Authorities also tested Famalaro ' s vehicles for traces of blood , but the official said those tests were also believed to be negative . The vehicles identified for testing included two white vans parked outside the home of Famalaro ' s mother , who lives next door to Famalaro ' s Prescott Country_Club home , and a 1977 Dodge pickup that was parked in his driveway . The tests involved the use of Luminol , a substance used to highlight blood traces when they cannot be scene under normal circumstances . The Hotpoint refrigerator-freezer was seized from Famalaro ' s kitchen at his Arizona hilltop home by investigators Monday . Famalaro lived_in the Laguna Hills warehouse facility between February , 1991 , and August , 1992 , according to the affidavit . Costa Mesa police recently found traces of blood there , and a diagram prepared by Costa Mesa Police Detective Jack Archer revealed that numerous bloodstains were detected around the area where the refrigerator-freezer had been installed . Authorities are expected to announce later this week whether samples taken from that area match blood taken from Huber ' s partially decomposed body . Based on interviews with Famalaro ' s brother-in-law , Duane A . Thobe , authorities stated in the affidavit that Thobe helped move Famalaro from a home_in Lake Forest to the warehouse in the spring or summer of 1990 . During that move , Thobe told investigators that he helped Famalaro construct a loft and a large wooden cabinet , approximately 10 feet by 4 feet , specifically to enclose the refrigerator-freezer . His lease did not allow him to live_in the warehouse , and several men who worked with Famalaro in his house-painting business said the area where he apparently took_up housekeeping was off-limits any time they visited . The wooden cabinet ' s swinging_doors were equipped to be locked , authorities said . Thobe told investigators that he had later seen the refrigerator-freezer in the cabinet and that Famalaro was using the warehouse as a &quot; residence-business. &quot; When Costa Mesa authorities went_to search the warehouse , detectives found that the cabinet and loft had been removed . However , investigators found traces of blood &quot; at or near where the refrigerator-freezer had been standing inside the cabinet , &quot; the affidavit stated . Tuesday , when Costa Mesa authorities returned to the Famalaro home_in Arizona to continue searching for clues , they removed two truckloads of lumber and other wooden pieces . Authorities declined to comment on why the wood was being seized , but an official close to the investigation said it was possible that police returned to Arizona to look_for materials that could have been used to build the cabinet and loft in Laguna Hills . Early in the investigation , both Costa Mesa police and Arizona officials expressed great interest in speaking with Thobe , who owns the country_club home here where Famalaro lived , and where authorities discovered Huber ' s body the 23-cubic-foot freezer that was running in the back of a Ryder rental truck . In the affidavit , Thobe was quoted as saying he &quot; made arrangements &quot; for Famalaro to move from the Laguna Hills warehouse to the Arizona home . Thobe said it took Famalaro from July , 1992 , to December of the same year to move all_of his household items into the upstairs living room in Thobe ' s split-level house . During that time , Thobe told authorities that he saw &quot; what he believes to be the same refrigerator formerly seen at the warehouse in Laguna Hills. &quot; Thobe said he moved all_of his possessions out of the country_club home less than a month after Famalaro moved_in . During the final search Tuesday of Famalaro ' s home , authorities also reported finding a number of weapons , assorted adult magazines and more blood stains in the garage near where officials recovered clothing belonging_to Denise Huber . Also among the items seized from the home were various newspaper_clippings , including an Orange County newspaper dated June 7 , 1991 , four days after Huber ' s mysterious disappearance . That edition carried an article detailing how authorities were baffled by the Newport Beach woman ' s disappearance , and that the family was offering a $ 5 # 000 reward for information that might reveal her whereabouts . The court documents said other newspaper_articles were also recovered , and Yavapai County sheriff ' s spokeswoman Laurie Berra said they were believed to contain accounts either of Huber ' s disappearance or the nationwide search organized by her family . Also among items seized was a Social_Security card belonging_to a woman named Patricia Ann Gage . Berra said investigators were seeking to contact her , as they did 11 other people -- mostly women -- whose identification , photographs or other personal items were found in the murder_suspect ' s cluttered home . &quot; We don ' t know who she is , or where she ' s from , but I ' m sure we will try to find her , &quot; Berra said . Costa Mesa Police Lt . Ron Smith , who returned to Yavapai County Tuesday with other Orange County authorities , was assisting in the search and left the Famalaro house with two long-barreled rifles slung over his shoulder . Smith was accompanied to Yavapai County by Orange County Deputy Dist . Atty . Chris Evans , who also toured the Famalaro home Tuesday and was expected to confer_with Yavapai Deputy County Atty . Thomas Lindberg about which state would ultimately assume jurisdiction in the_matter . Evans declined to comment Tuesday , but the jurisdiction decision is expected to rely heavily on whether Huber ' s blood can be matched to a sample found in an Orange County storage facility rented by Famalaro shortly after Huber ' s disappearance . Preliminary tests have narrowed the range of possibilities , and investigators are using DNA-type testing to make a definitive determination . Those results are not expected back until Thursday , Berra said . Authorities arrived_at the Famalaro home about 9 a.m. Tuesday and loaded lumber and other wood items into a waiting pickup_truck . By noon , officials left the hilltop location and officers removed the yellow crime-scene tape from the perimeter of the residence . &quot; As far as we ' re concerned the home is released , &quot; Berra said .</TEXT>
