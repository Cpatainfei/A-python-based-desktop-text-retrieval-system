   <HEADLINE> IT TAKES A LOT OF PATIENCE AND A LITTLE MOXIE TO NAVIGATE THE NET ; COMPUTERS : GOING ON-LINE CAN BE LIKE HACKING YOUR WAY THROUGH THE JUNGLE . BUT IF YOU FIND THE RIGHT GUIDE , IT CAN BE AN INTERESTING TREK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I just got E-mail from someone named Moxie . He writes that he can ' t pull_up my . plan file . ( A . plan file is kind of like a business_card that anyone should be able to read on the Internet. ) One solution , he writes , is to &quot; simply type : chmond ug + r OME / .plan &quot; in the command_line . Simply ? Clearly Moxie , whoever he is , has a different view of complexity than me , and I am impressed . While I ' m contemplating that , Moxie , who happens to be on-line on the same system I ' m on , beeps me -- indicating that he wants to &quot; chat. &quot; ( &quot; Chatting , &quot; on-line , usually takes the form of two people typing at each other , in real time. ) We chat . Moxie is pleasant and articulate , which you can ' t help but notice in a world that ' s jammed full of science / engineer / don ' t-read-literature types . Eventually , he helps me remove an electronic pebble from my virtual shoe . ( The last line of text always gets cut_off on my PowerBook when I ' m reading news in Usenet . &quot; Why , Moxie , why ? &quot; I type . He tells me to check the configuration file of my communications program . Of course ! ) Moxie , clearly , is a valuable find . Sensing the opportunity to bag another brain for my source collection , I type , &quot; What do you do for a living ? &quot; &quot; Are you sure you want to know ? &quot; Moxie types back . &quot; Of course I want to know , &quot; I reply , thinking , what can be so bad ? Is he a lawyer ? A dentist ? &quot; Well , &quot; types Moxie , &quot; I ' m 13 years old and go_to junior_high_school &quot; on Long_Island . Thunk . that ' s me passing_out . I feel_like that guy in &quot; The Crying Game. &quot; All this time , I ' ve been chatting with -- no , getting educated by -- a 13-year-old ! * Now , I ' m no age bigot or anything . I know teen-agers are important to . . . um . . . the economy , because they buy all those baggy , way-long shorts that droop below their knees . And , if it weren ' t for 13-year-olds , there ' d be no &quot; Beavis and Butt-head , &quot; no bar_mitzvahs either . But still , I never imagined I ' d be having a chat with one who was intellectually stimulating . It was kind of an epiphany . It shouldn ' t have been . It makes perfect sense that Moxie , whose real name is Mark Mentovai , is 13 : The Internet belongs_to 13-year-olds ; cyberspace is as much their world as mine . When you ' re 13 , life itself is still new , surprising and yet tough to navigate . Just like the Internet . A 13-year-old gets on-line and finds_out he needs to learn a little Unix to get_around the Net . Fine , he learns Unix . What else is he going_to do ? His taxes ? Just to be sure Moxie isn ' t really , say , a 58-year-old legal secretary giving me the business , I do a little database work , finding_out his real name , running his family ' s name through a list of registered voters on Long_Island . I find a telephone_number for the family and call . A kid picks_up the phone on the first ring . When he says , &quot; Hello , &quot; his voice cracks , and I think : ( a ) He really is 13 and ( b ) It ' s great to be 37 . Compared to 13 , 37 is like being Cary Grant . Moxie tells me he got his first computer for Christmas , four years ago . The modem came later , &quot; for graduation from sixth grade last year. &quot; Moxie explains his technique for getting the modem : &quot; I bugged my parents . I had to bug them for a year . You know , every now and then , ' Mom , can I have a modem ? ' Or , ' Dad , can you go_out and ask Mom to get me a modem ? Kevin ' s getting one . . . . ' &quot; Kevin is Moxie ' s friend . I don ' t think he has a modem yet . Moxie gets his modem , naturally ; no parent could withstand his scorched-earth attack and he also gets an account on CompuServe , so he can correspond with an uncle in Connecticut . &quot; We were both E-mailing each other and telling cool places we found. &quot; It only whetted Moxie ' s appetite . His mother , already worn down by the Modem War , launched a preemptive strike : &quot; For my 13th birthday this year , my mom made this booklet that said ' Internet ! ' on every single page , 20 pages of it . Finally , on the last page it said that I could research the local providers and find_out which one would be cost-efficient , and subscribe , &quot; Moxie says . &quot; I like researching that stuff. &quot; Moxie shocker . * At first , his parents showed the usual concern any parent might have about opening_up their child to 25 million people . &quot; My parents would look over my shoulder a lot , especially when I read E-mail . After a while , they got bored with it , &quot; he says , noting that occasionally now , when they do angle in_for a shoulder surf , he blocks their view . &quot; Some stuff I don ' t let them read because they shouldn ' t read it , &quot; he says . &quot; Like what ? &quot; I ask . &quot; Well , you probably shouldn ' t know either , &quot; he says . Now , I know there ' s lots of stuff on the Net that a 13-year-old kid shouldn ' t be exposed to , at least until he ' s say , 14 , and , I ' m all too aware of the hapless hysteria emanating from television_news magazines about cyberperverts and all_the rest , so I ask Moxie how he handles it . &quot; I don ' t get_into that stuff , &quot; he says , referring to the many news groups that provide forums for adult discussions . He also practices safe computing . &quot; My mom and dad warned me about 10 # 000 times : I never give_out information about myself to people . My name is my limit. &quot; We talk_about what it ' s like being 13 years old on the Internet and how it ' s fun to talk to adults who don ' t have any preconceived notions of who you are ( hmmmm , maybe they ' re not really adults either ? ) and Moxie said that there are a lot of people out there like him . Thirteen years old , that is . In fact , he points me to a little-known Usenet group , called K12.chat.junior that exists solely for sixth- through eighth-graders . * Well , I ' ve gone this far . I check_into the Usenet group to see what sixth- through eighth-graders talk_about on-line . It was not a pretty sight . &quot; I ' M BORED , &quot; says one message ' s subject line . &quot; Key pal wanted ! ! ! ! ! &quot; say lots of others . &quot; Nothing happened today , &quot; writes a person named Lisa . &quot; A stupid grade-eight loser took my seat on the bus and of course the bus_driver is too dumb to make a seating plan. &quot; &quot; Hey dudes and dudettes ! How ' s it going ? Just wanted to say hi , &quot; someone else writes . &quot; I am in grade seven and turning 12 November 14th . I live_in Alberta , Canada . I have a_few fish , two dogs ( Maltise Poodl ) , two turtles , one cat and one iguana , &quot; writes a third . I ' m starting to get dizzy from the correspondence . There are more_than 700 posts from the past week . One thing you see immediately is , the hype about how computers are geared for boys is ridiculous : Most of the people here are girls . Someone named Fern , who apparently just got_back from a vacation in Canada , asks : &quot; One thing I did wonder ( never stopped to see ) is if McDonalds has Quarter Pounders or like . 5 kilogrammers . Any Canadians know ? &quot; A Canadian eighth-grader responds : &quot; We have Quarter Pounders . . . . What ' s a . 5 kilogrammer ? ? &quot; I can ' t take any more of this . I need to talk to an adult . Wonder what Moxie ' s up_to .</TEXT>
