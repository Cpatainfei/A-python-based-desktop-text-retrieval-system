   <HEADLINE> MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ : DINERS ' CLUBS ; FAST-FOOD CHAINS TEST REWARDS FOR REGULAR CUSTOMERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s one thing that keeps Diana Bullen returning to the McDonald ' s restaurant inside the shopping_mall where she works . Free McFood . Every fifth time she buys something -- even a cup of coffee -- at the McDonald ' s inside the Paramus Park Mall in northern New Jersey , she receives a coupon for a free menu item of comparable cost . Since Bullen is a cashier at a clothing_store near the McDonald ' s , she stops there several times a week -- usually for a McChicken sandwich . Said Bullen : &quot; I wish all McDonald ' s had the same deal. &quot; Fast-food industry consultants say her wish may soon become reality -- not just at McDonald ' s , but across the fast-food industry . Much like the free plane_tickets that major airlines flaunt to lure frequent fliers and establish customer loyalty , the fast-food industry giants may also use free food to coax value-hungry customers into eating_at their restaurants . &quot; No customer is going_to eat three meals a day at McDonald ' s , &quot; said Raj Chaudhry , consulting editor at Restaurants &amp; Institutions magazine . &quot; But the concept of giving free food to frequent customers is a good one . The question is , will people buy_into it ? &quot; that ' s what all_the fast-food chains are trying to find_out . After two years of industry test-marketing at both the franchise and company store levels , several fast-food companies are gearing_up to expand the programs at local and national levels . Hardee ' s is setting_up a special division to test the program at some company-owned stores . Arby ' s , which has been experimenting with a frequent-customer program for two years , plans to expand it this year . The McDonald ' s franchisee in northern New Jersey is so pleased with the program that it plans to expand it to five more outlets this year . And while McDonald ' s spokespersons declined to comment about the chain ' s national plans , industry_analysts say the company is closely monitoring its New Jersey franchisee because the king of fast food is considering testing the program on a larger scale . Meanwhile , officials at Burger King and KFC are also closed-mouthed about their plans for frequent-diner programs , but a Burger King franchisee is testing a program in New York state , as is a KFC franchisee in western Canada . &quot; Once one of the major players gets_into it in a big way -- and shows some success -- everyone else will jump_on board , &quot; said Robert Sandelman , founder of Sandelman &amp; Associates , a fast-food consulting_firm based in Brea . These high-tech frequent-customer programs are a far_cry from familiar pizza_parlor punch_cards , where customers get free pizzas for every 10 visits . Most of the fast-food chains are testing plastic cards with magnetic strips -- much like credit_cards -- that with one swipe help the chains learn more about their best customers . Computer_databases track where customers live , what items they prefer , even how much they spend each time they go_to the outlet . The chains then use the information to target their most frequent customers with coupon mailings at_home . But there are many potential pitfalls . Chief among them : Unlike the airline frequent-flier programs , where the rewards are substantial , there is some question whether occasional free burgers or french fries are enough to turn fickle consumers into frequent customers . &quot; There is little loyalty in the fast-food industry , &quot; Sandelman said . When people get hungry , they usually prefer to eat_at the closest place , he said . There is also some question whether the financial lure is big enough . &quot; You ' re not going_to get many people to change their dining habits for rewards that are only worth pennies , &quot; said Ron Paul , president of Technomic Inc. , a Chicago research firm . * Fast-food analysts note that the programs are costly to administer and could force chains to raise food prices . But fast-food executives say that has not been the case in test markets . Also , it may be very difficult to coax people to carry more plastic in their wallets . And if the process of running the cards through the high-tech equipment adds_to the waiting time , it might irritate customers more interested in saving time than a_few pennies . &quot; Nothing like this has ever been done_in the fast-food business , &quot; said Nick Karousatos , director of business analysis at Arby ' s , which is the clear leader in testing frequent-diner programs . &quot; There are still a lot of issues to be resolved . Since late 1992 , Arby ' s has signed_on 64 # 000 &quot; Club Arby ' s &quot; members in four cities . Customers not only receive coupons for free food , but also accumulate points for prizes . Eager to get free food , customers with the cards are returning to the participating Arby ' s nearly 30 % more often than before the program was tested , Karousatos said . At the McDonald ' s in Paramus Park , customers see their names flash in lights on the cash_register ' s computer_screen after their frequent-diner card is entered . Some 28 # 000 frequent-customer cards have been passed_out since the program began two years ago , said Mike Leoce , manager of the franchise unit . &quot; Almost everyone who works in the mall has one of these cards. &quot; Leoce said . &quot; If you give customers something for free , they are bound to come back. &quot; Besides the free food , frequent diners at the unit can also receive free McDonald ' s-related merchandise , such_as Ronald McDonald watches . And frequent diners are automatically entered into drawings for even bigger prizes , such_as $ 100 McDonald ' s food certificates . Hardee ' s will begin testing the concept later this year . It hopes to establish a program that doesn ' t require frequent customers to carry plastic membership_cards , said Neil Cafasso , director of marketing research at Rocky Mount , N.C.-based Hardee ' s . If nothing else , Hardee ' s has a nifty name for its program : Frequent Fryer Club . Briefly . . . Los Angeles-based Fotouhi Alonso Advertising has been named agency of record for Air L.A. , the Los Angeles airline that flies to smaller markets in California and Mexico . The account is less than $ 1 million . . . . Los Angeles-based La Agencia de Orci has been selected by MCI to help develop Spanish-language broadcast and print ads targeting Latino businesses . . . . Electronic Retailing , a new publication about the electronic marketing industry , is being published by Van Nuys-based Creative Age Publications . Fast-Food Fanatics Ever wonder who eats the most fast-food ? Here ' s a demographic profile of adult fast-food customers in Southern California . The telephone survey of 600 customers was taken_in the last_quarter of 1993 . Percentages refer to the number of respondents who said they eat fast food at least once a month . SEX Male : 49.3 % Female : 50.7 AGE 16-18 : 6.2 % 19-24 : 14.6 25-34 : 27.3 35-44 : 21.2 45-54 : 17.2 55-64 : 13.5 Note : Consumers over age 64 were excluded from the survey because they are regarded by most fast food_chains as very infrequent fast food customers .
