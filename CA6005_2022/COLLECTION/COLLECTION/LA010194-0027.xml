   <HEADLINE> COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY BOWL REPORT ; SUGAR_BOWL ; FLORIDA HOPING FOR A SWEETER RESULT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the only other meeting between the teams , West_Virginia upset Florida , 26-6 , in the 1981 Peach Bowl . Afterward , Gator Coach Charley Pell burned film of the game and later buried it in a corner of the Florida practice field and erected a small monument as a reminder to the embarrassment . Steve Spurrier said he noticed the monument when he took_over as Florida coach before the 1990 season , and had it removed . &quot; West_Virginia is not a part of our practice field anymore , &quot; Spurrier said . West_Virginia Coach Don Nehlen used the film-burning anecdote to make a not-so-subtle plea for a new practice field . Nehlen said there isn ' t enough room to bury anything on the Mountaineers ' field . &quot; We ' re trying to find a_hundred yards of field that is flat in West_Virginia , &quot; Nehlen said . * Tailback Jon Jones , who missed most of the season after breaking his leg in the season opener , will play a lot against Florida , Nehlen said . Jones was the starter until the injury and was replaced by sophomore Robert Walker , who gained 1 # 304 yards . Jones returned late in the season but had not healed completely . Nehlen said the month off before the Sugar_Bowl has helped . &quot; Jon Jones , going_into the season , in my opinion , was a big_league running back , &quot; Nehlen said . &quot; Jon Jones ( now ) looks_like Jon Jones . If he is Jon Jones , he ' s going_to play. &quot; * Nehlen may or may_not celebrate his 58th birthday today . &quot; After the game , I ' ll probably feel a helluva lot older or a helluva lot younger , &quot; he said . . . . The Mountaineers left rowdy New Orleans to spend Friday night before the game day at a remote , undisclosed location in Mississippi . &quot; The noise is a factor , &quot; Nehlen said . &quot; I ' m glad we ' re leaving . I know they won ' t get_into trouble where they ' re going because I ' ve never heard of it. &quot; . . . Florida is looking_for its first Sugar_Bowl victory in the school ' s fourth appearance .
