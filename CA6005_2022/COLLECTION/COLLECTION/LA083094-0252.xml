   <HEADLINE> MORE O.C. FIRMS FORGING LINKS TO CHINA ; TRADE : THEY HOPE TO FOLLOW IN FOOTSTEPS OF AST RESEARCH , LEADING SELLER OF PCS IN THE ASIAN_NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Paced by computer manufacturer AST Research Inc. , the leading seller of personal_computers in China , numerous Orange County companies in recent years have established trade links to the Asian_nation , the world ' s largest emerging market . In fact , AST Chairman Safi Qureshey joined 24 other executives accompanying U.S. Secretary_of_Commerce Ron Brown on his visit to Beijing this week . Other Orange County executives in the delegation include Leslie McCraw , chairman of Fluor Corp . in Irvine , and Susan Corrales-Diaz , president of Orange-based Systems Integrated . On Monday , Brown signed a broad agreement meant to lead to improved commerce between the two nations . Brown , who met with Chinese Premier Li Peng , is the highest-level U.S. official to visit China since President Clinton renewed that country ' s favorable trading status in May . AST has followed what has become a common strategy for U.S. companies in China -- establishing a joint_venture to gain acceptance in local markets -- and other companies have turned_to partners in Hong Kong . Local trade experts said they hope Brown ' s visit will reduce the need for such arrangements to gain access to the booming Chinese economy . As things stand , &quot; it ' s hard to deal directly with a company in China , &quot; said Brian Rauso , director of the Glasser Group Inc. , an Irvine-based brokerage focused_on international trade . Glasser Group sells electronic banking equipment such_as automated teller machines to the Chinese through a partnership with a Hong Kong distributor . &quot; It ' s more_than just a language_barrier , &quot; Rauso said . &quot; It ' s an unspoken language ; it ' s that everybody sort of scratches each other ' s back over there. &quot; The partnership had been instrumental in helping his firm build_up orders worth $ 20 million to $ 40 million within the past eight months , Rauso said . Colleen Costello of the World Trade Center Assn . of Orange County in Irvine said arrangements with middlemen are common . &quot; The way the Chinese government has it set_up , China is currently very difficult for you to go_in there cold , &quot; said Costello , the association ' s director of member services . Hugo Fruehauf , president of Ball-Efratom in Irvine , said he expected a recent joint_venture agreement with several state-owned companies in China to lead to increased revenue for his company , which sold about $ 2 million worth of telecommunications_equipment in China last year . &quot; The Chinese either want to have a technology transfer , or want to learn how to build what you ' ve got , &quot; Fruehauf said . In response , his company -- a division of Ball Corp . -- has tried to license older telecommunications designs for joint_ventures , he said . Although not part of Brown ' s trade mission , several Ball-Efratom officials are in China now , Fruehauf said . &quot; The market size is there , &quot; he said . &quot; We looked_at that and said we shouldn ' t ignore it. &quot; Eventually , Fruehauf said , his company hopes to do several times as much business there as it does today . AST ' s entry into the Chinese market began with the 1985 opening of a manufacturing site in Hong Kong . The company opened a Beijing sales office in 1988 . AST chose Hong Kong first because it was already open_to western businesses , a company spokeswoman said Monday . Earlier this year , AST completed construction of a $ 16-million manufacturing_plant built_in a joint_venture with the Chinese government in Tianjin , about 60 miles southeast of Beijing . The Irvine-based computer maker controlled about 33 % of the Chinese personal_computer market in 1993 , according to International Data Corp . of Hong Kong . Compaq Computer Corp . in Houston was in second place with about 24 % . John Voisinet , general merchandise manager for Intersport Fashions West Inc. in Orange , said he once thought only companies of AST ' s size could establish successful trade partnerships in China . Explaining how his privately held apparel company decided to begin selling in China four years ago , Voisinet said , &quot; It was mainly because we were already in Hong Kong. &quot; Intersport had contracts with factories in Hong Kong to manufacture motorcycle clothing with Harley-Davidson labels . But his only access to China was through his company ' s Hong Kong distributor , Voisinet said . &quot; When you go directly in , you have government problems , political problems . One thing you learn very quickly is that Chinese like to work directly with Chinese , &quot; he said . &quot; You ' re dealing with a regime that has a Communist philosophy but that ' s full of capitalization. &quot; Uncertainty over the political future of Hong Kong after it returns to Chinese rule_in 1997 also worries some investors , Voisinet said , although he said he doesn ' t expect many changes . The exact amount of trade between China and Orange County is difficult to determine , because the U.S. Department_of_Commerce does not keep such figures . However , the Los Angeles Area Customs District , which serves businesses in Orange County and throughout Southern California , handled $ 10.8 billion in imports from China in 1993 , compared with exports to China of only $ 1.4 billion . Those figures account only for goods shipped directly between the two countries . The actual trade_balance is probably less extreme , because it would have to include the value of professional services provided to China by U.S. firms , such_as architects , lawyers and investment_bankers , said Gladys Moreau , director of the Export Small Business Development Center , a nonprofit trade group in Los Angeles .</TEXT>
