   <HEADLINE> 180 NATIONS ADOPT POPULATION PLAN ; GROWTH : U.N. CONFERENCE ENDS BY APPROVING PROGRAM TO LIMIT WORLD ' S PEOPLE TO 7.2 BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES . IT GETS PARTIAL ENDORSEMENT FROM THE VATICAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over a chorus of reservations from Latin_American and Islamic countries still troubled about abortion and family issues , nearly 180 nations adopted a wide-ranging plan Tuesday on global population , the first in history to obtain partial endorsement from the Vatican . The plan , approved on the final day of the U.N. population conference here , for the first time tries to limit the growth of the world ' s population , by preventing it from exceeding 7.2 billion people over the next two decades . It sets_aside a focus_on issues of contraception and demographic quotas alone in favor of broad new health_care programs and the freedom for families to choose how many children they have . It establishes a controversial new category of &quot; reproductive rights &quot; and emphasizes improving health , education and living standards for women in the expectation that they will then elect to have smaller families . The Vatican , whose battle over the abortion issue dominated the nine-day International Conference on Population and Development , elected not to support contentious chapters dealing with abortion , extramarital_sex and adolescent sex . But the Holy_See said there were enough positive elements in the program of action -- including its linking of population to development , its stand against coercion in population policies and its promotion of women ' s status and the family -- that the church wished for the first time to join in an international consensus on population policy , if only partially . The Roman_Catholic_Church refused to join either of the past two global population programs , adopted in 1974 in Bucharest , Romania , and in 1984 in Mexico_City . &quot; Nothing that the Holy_See has done_in this consensus process should be understood or interpreted as an endorsement of concepts it cannot support for moral reasons , &quot; Archbishop Renato Martino said . &quot; Especially nothing is to be understood to imply that the Holy_See endorses abortion or has in any way changed its moral position concerning abortion or on contraceptives or sterilization nor on the use of condoms in HIV / AIDS prevention programs. &quot; A flock of nations shared the Vatican ' s objections but elected to simply record them and join in a full consensus on the plan_of_action . The reservations -- from Peru , Ecuador , Argentina , the Dominican_Republic , the United Arab Emirates , Nicaragua , Honduras , El_Salvador , Guatemala , Venezuela , Costa Rica , Paraguay , Brunei , Malta , Libya , Yemen and Iran -- diminished the broad consensus that U.N. officials had hoped for . Several other nations , including Egypt , Pakistan , Algeria , Afghanistan , Syria , Kuwait , Ghana , Jordan , Malaysia , Djibouti , Maldives , Indonesia and Tunisia , emphasized that the plan could be implemented only in the context of their Islamic laws , religion and culture . Timothy E . Wirth , U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs and head of the U.S. delegation , was nonetheless upbeat . &quot; The consensus was much broader than anything we thought was going_to be possible , &quot; he said . &quot; I would remind you that two years ago at the Earth Summit in Rio , nations couldn ' t even talk_about the problem of population , it was so contentious . Imagine how much progress we ' ve made in the last two years , when we cannot only talk_about this and talk_about it honestly and openly , but we can also come_to agreement on a very , very progressive document , &quot; Wirth said . &quot; I think the world is never going_to be the same after Cairo. &quot; Feminist organizations around the world , which had pushed for the idea that empowering women is the key to curbing population growth , were jubilant about the plan , though it fell_short_of the goal quietly expressed by many of making safe , legal abortion available worldwide . Instead , it states that abortion is not to be used as a family-planning tool and emphasizes the responsibility of nations to deal with the health consequences of unsafe illegal abortion . &quot; It is very close to everything we hoped it would be . It ' s like 98 % , &quot; said Joan Dunlap , head of the International Women ' s Health Coalition . &quot; Population programs and policies have failed in many countries because they had no roots , and they have failed because they have not been just , &quot; she said . &quot; This approach says we need to focus_on women ' s fertility . It has shifted the focus to the individual woman and says if we meet her needs , not only is that just and humane , but we judge it will have a very successful demographic impact. &quot; But the International Right_to_Life Federation said the strong language emphasizing that abortion is not to be promoted for family_planning , plus the widespread concern about the issue on the part of Latin_American , African and Muslim countries , indicated that the conference was &quot; clearly a defeat for the Clinton Administration. &quot; &quot; It will be difficult for those governmental and non-governmental organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere who are dedicated to promoting abortion in the developing world to claim that this conference gave them a mandate to do so , &quot; the organization said . Vatican officials said much of the world may_not yet be ready for the kind of far-reaching proposals envisioned in the program of action . &quot; These were new ideas , and the capacity to receive these new ideas was not fully as open as some of the planners expected , &quot; said Bishop James McHugh . Although the head-butting on abortion prompted new calls_for review of the Vatican ' s status as a full member in the United Nations , church officials said their vigorous input on abortion and family issues was a necessary ingredient of the debate . &quot; Any international effort , any international conference that attempts to run itself purely on secular principles , is doomed to failure , &quot; McHugh said . Indeed , a wide bloc of Islamic nations proved to be among the Vatican ' s staunchest allies , arguing against non-traditional unions that might include homosexuality , safe_sex and discussion of &quot; individuals ' &quot; sexual_activity , as opposed to sex within marriage .</TEXT>
