   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 : 35 DAYS AND COUNTING ; BORA ! BORA ! BORA ? ; MILUTINOVIC ENJOYED WORLD CUP SUCCESS WITH MEXICO AND COSTA RICA , BUT THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE HIS BIGGEST CHALLENGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It can be anywhere -- Albuquerque or Yemen . It can be in Buenos Aires or San Francisco . At a hotel or on a soccer field . It is always a crowd . Sometimes a throng . They seek him . They are Serbian , Czech , Romanian . . . . They are from Guadalajara or San Salvador or San Jose . Some are sycophants , some are fans . The object of their desire is Velibor Milutinovic . Bora , the coach of the U.S. World Cup team . Often it ' s a phone_call , but it might also be a note pressed into the hand of someone else to be passed_on . If he ' s approached in_person , he might stop and sign an autograph . Or he might select one of five languages and chat briefly . He might shake a hand , kiss a child . He might linger , but he won ' t stay . He must always move . Away from Yugoslavia and the memories of World_War_II , which left him an orphan . Away from the soccer clubs that he says have cheated him . Always moving to the next place , which is sure to be better . He is always optimistic , but wary . * Milutinovic was born in Bajina Basta , in Yugoslavia ' s Serbian republic , but didn ' t live there long . The war changed that . First his father and then his mother were killed fighting the Nazis , and he and his sister and four brothers were sent to live with an aunt in Bor , about 30 miles from the borders of Romania and Bulgaria . The loss was deeply felt and long held . Even now , with his facility for languages , Milutinovic refuses to learn or speak German . His aunt was a strict disciplinarian , which made life difficult for a hyperkinetic youngster . School was important to his aunt , but soccer was important to Bora . At 15 , Milutinovic had finished the schooling offered in the small_town and with his brothers went_to live_in Belgrade . Milutinovic thought this new arrangement would be a bonanza -- he and his brothers would play soccer all day and forget about school . But Milos Milutinovic , one of Yugoslavia ' s greatest players , was far more strict than his aunt had been . The new rules : No soccer until school and schoolwork were finished . But soccer was Bora ' s destiny . Milos and Milorad were already spectacular soccer players and able to judge their younger brother ' s talent . As he improved , they acquiesced and soccer became the focus of family life . The three were_on the Yugoslav national team at_the_same_time , and the Milutinovic name became famous in Europe . Bora was a midfielder with Belgrade for 10 years , four on the youth team and six with the first_team . He played_on the Yugoslav Olympic team in 1964 . Two years later , Milutinovic had a chance to play in Switzerland . He took it . And he went_back to his homeland only once . His second life began on_the_road . After Switzerland , Milutinovic played in Monaco , France , coached in Argentina and , finally , Mexico . In Mexico_City , Milutinovic found his heart . &quot; Serbians and Mexicans are the same , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s the same feeling and atmosphere . I am more Mexican than Yugoslav . I ' ve lived_in Mexico for 19 years . In Belgrade , I had no identification with anything . In Mexico , I like the people. &quot; His plan called_for him to stay for two years . Milutinovic ' s first wife , a Yugoslav , didn ' t care_for Mexico and left . They divorced . Milutinovic then met the sister of a teammate and they married . He and Mari Carmen have a daughter , Darinka , who is named after Milutinovic ' s mother . Mexico became home . For the first time , Milutinovic put_down roots . His playing career evolved into a coaching career and worldwide fame . * The idea of the United States scouring the world to find a coach for its national soccer team displeased many coaches in the United States . &quot; I had coaches in our own federation who thought I had sold_out the coaching program in the United States , &quot; said Hank Steinbrecher , general secretary of the U.S. Soccer Federation , who conducted the job interviews . But American coaches had not proved their worth on the international stage . The United States , for instance , lost all three games in the 1990 World Cup_finals under Bob Gansler , who had never even been to the World Cup as a spectator . When the USSF ' s search began in 1991 , the emphasis was not so_much on experience -- plenty of candidates had that -- but on finding a coach who could squeeze the last drop of potential out of a lightly regarded team . Milutinovic ' s name came_up again and again . He had coached first Mexico , then Costa Rica to surprising World Cup success . German Coach Franz Beckenbauer told the USSF that Milutinovic was the only person who could do the job . &quot; Beckenbauer said , ' In order to coach in the United States , you need a very special human being . Bora can do the job for you . He ' s the only guy you should hire , ' &quot; Steinbrecher said . Steinbrecher visited Milutinovic at his home_in Mexico_City and on the flight back said to himself , &quot; This is our man. &quot; Milutinovic sometimes comes_across as scatterbrained and disorganized , but he showed Steinbrecher detailed records of World Cup preparations from 1986 and 1990 . The other issue was Milutinovic ' s reputation as a carpetbagging coach who followed the paychecks around the world . His personal charm , some said , masked insincerity and clever calculation . The USSF was aware and concerned . But it wasn ' t looking_for a commitment as much as results . &quot; I grew to respect him over the years , more_than when I first met him , &quot; Steinbrecher said . &quot; There ' s a method behind his madness . I thought he was a quick-fix artist and he ' d just come_in and coach us through the World Cup . I ' ve been impressed with the way he works with the younger players . These people who see him only as fluff -- they are seriously mistaken . He ' s very cagey. &quot; Evasiveness is one of Milutinovic ' s defense_mechanisms . For example , he says he ' s 49 . But the official report of the 1990 World Cup lists him as 51 at the time , which would make him 55 now . A favorite of his tactics is to never answer a direct question directly . This used to mean not answering in English . Now , it means using greatly improved English but simply not answering . The personable Milutinovic is_well liked by reporters , but he has proved to be of little use as a source for information about his team . It might have all been part of the plan . &quot; Bora is a very evasive guy when it comes_to giving_out information that he wants to keep close to him , &quot; said Steinbrecher , who said Milutinovic doesn ' t even tell him the players who are going_to start . &quot; Bora does the sidestep better than anybody . He has a unique charm when it comes_to this . I don ' t want to squelch it . He ' s generated a hell of a lot of interest. &quot; This shows itself at every stop the national team makes . Milutinovic is mobbed by expatriate Yugoslavs or Mexicans or other soccer-loving people . But Milutinovic is far less known in the United States than in other countries . He knows it but says he doesn ' t care . &quot; If you are with me in restaurants , the cooks know me , &quot; he says , laughing . &quot; These people , and the gardeners , they know me . This is enough . You have good results , you are famous . You don ' t have good results , you are not famous . This is the life. &quot; * There are parallels between Milutinovic ' s tenure as coach of the U.S. World Cup team and his previous national coaching_jobs . Despite its status as World Cup host in 1986 , Mexico ' s national team had little realistic basis for high expectations . In eight previous World Cup_finals , Mexico had compiled a record of 3-17-4 and had failed to qualify in 1982 . Milutinovic was widely known by Mexico ' s soccer fans as the successful coach of the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico Pumas club in Mexico_City . In six seasons under him , Pumas won two league titles , two CONCACAF Champions Cups and one Inter-Americana Cup . The competition in the World Cup_finals is_on a higher level , but insistent fans fully expected Milutinovic to transfer his success from one arena to another . He succeeded by reordering the structure of Mexican soccer and wresting control of the national team players from the clubs that paid their salaries . A training camp was established and the World Cup team , for the most part , trained together daily for more_than year . Milutinovic also planned an ambitious preparation that no nation had before undertaken , scheduling 62 games -- nearly 50 full internationals . Critics said the barnstorming exposed the team to too many games in too_little time . Milutinovic had an idea he was right about the World Cup buildup . In the three years he coached the Mexican national team , Milutinovic compiled a 29-7-15 record . Thus were the high expectations of Mexican fans justified . Milutinovic made shrewd use of his assistant coaches , dispatching them to scout the team ' s first-round opponents by posing as fans and ingratiating themselves with team officials . The team also wrung_out the maximum home advantage by playing all its first-round games in Azteca Stadium in Mexico_City , a venue that , for opponents , offered the lethal double whammy of 120 # 000 Mexican fans screaming at altitude . The home team rolled through to the quarterfinals , drawing West Germany in the heat of Monterrey . Mexico ' s unraveling began late in the first_half when its playmaker , Thomas Boy , was injured and had to leave the game . West Germany won on penalty kicks . Only after the disappointment had subsided did Mexico begin to evaluate its team ' s sixth-place performance and deem it creditable . Not since 1970 , when Mexico was also the host nation , had the team advanced as far as the quarterfinals . Before the next World Cup , Milutinovic got an emergency call from Costa Rica . The team , along with the United States , had already qualified for the 1990 Italian World Cup from the CONCACAF region . Scarcely two months before the start of the finals , Milutinovic was called_in to repair a splintered team . Milutinovic ' s first move was to dump six popular players , among them the team captain . He reasoned that the team would be_better served with speed and strength than with unharnessed talent . His second move also rankled fans . Because of the stifling pressure and distractions in Costa Rica , Milutinovic took his team to Italy five weeks early . That he preferred the relative tranquillity of soccer-mad Italy gives insight to the mania rampant in Costa Rica at the time . To further loosen_up his players , Milutinovic allowed , indeed encouraged , visits to local discos . The players soon became welcomed fixtures on the Genoa night scene . Thus did the smallest nation in the World Cup prepare_for battle against soccer ' s giants . Milutinovic ' s reputation as a master tactician was solidified during the tournament . He had a good goalkeeper but otherwise an average team . Improbably , Costa Rica beat Scotland and Sweden and lost , 1-0 , to mighty Brazil , gaining the quarterfinals . Its CONCACAF cousin , the United States , was eliminated after losing all three games in the first round . But the same luck that had brought_down Roy in Mexico also knocked_out Costa Rica ' s goalkeeper , Gabelo Conejo , and suddenly Milutinovic ' s team was out , losing to Czechoslovakia , 4-1 . But again , advancement past the first round was seen as a triumph . And so it would be viewed for the U.S. team . U.S. Soccer Federation President Alan Rothenberg said Thursday that he had &quot; unbridled confidence &quot; in Milutinovic . &quot; He has the reputation as a miracle_worker because of what he did with Mexico and Costa Rica , &quot; Rothenberg said . &quot; He ' ll have his hands full duplicating those accomplishments. &quot; There are also these obscure statistics : Milutinovic has never coached a team through World Cup qualifying . The World Cup host nation has never failed to advance to the second round . * &quot; Bora likes America , &quot; said team General_Manager Bill Nuttall . &quot; I think he appreciates freedom . He appreciates that if we put our minds to something , we can get_it done . He ' s played everywhere . He ' s been everywhere . He ' s been affected by wars , by all kinds of adversity . He ' s been affected by all that. &quot; Although he still gives the impression of being a moving target , Milutinovic does seem to enjoy his life in Laguna Niguel , even if he has not completely adopted American ways . The miracle_worker works in his own way . &quot; From a traditional American management perspective , Bora is difficult , &quot; Steinbrecher said . &quot; He ' ll change his direction ; he ' ll change his mind . He ' s like a sly fox . But Bora and I understand each other . I think the man is a genius . &quot; Has he panned_out ? If you look_at the win-loss record , the answer has to be no . If you look_at where we were three years ago -- stylistically , lack of competition , the credibility -- the answer has to be yes. &quot; Milutinovic , who is under contract through December , suggests he still enjoys moving , but soon it might affect his daughter . &quot; Now , Darinka is young , it is not so bad , &quot; he said . &quot; I think it is good for her . She learns a new culture and can make new friends . At some age , after , we should stop for Darinka . For the school . &quot; I like to be_on the road . People call me a Gypsy . But I like it . It is a chance for things . To learn a new language . To learn new things . It is good . For me to be happy , my private life and the team have to do_well . Nothing more. &quot; Profile : Bora Milutinovic * Name : Velibor Milutinovic . * Date of birth : Sept . 7 , 1944 ( according to U.S. Soccer media guide ) . * Place_of_birth : Bajina Basta , Yugoslavia . * Nationality : Serbian . * Date named national coach : March 27 , 1991 . * Cumulative record ( U.S. team , full internationals ) : 26-30-26 ; ( full internationals with Mexico , Costa Rica and the U.S. ) : 57-41-41 ; ( cumulative World Cup record ) : 5-2-2 . * Little-known item : He is believed to have coached in more full internationals than any other coach in history . * Honors : He is one of only two coaches to have coached three countries in the World Cup_final .</TEXT>
