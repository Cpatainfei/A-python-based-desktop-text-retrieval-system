   <HEADLINE> STAGE WATCH : THEATRE LA PRESIDENT SOUNDS UPBEAT NOTE AT CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two years ago , when the first West Coast Theatre Conference was incorporated into ShowBiz Expo , an entertainment_industry trade fair , it kicked_off with a keynote jeremiad from Susan Loewenberg , a producer who had abandoned staged drama for radio drama . She warned that L.A. theater was in crisis , and she offered little hope of improvement . The 1993 edition of the same conference substituted a keynote panel for a keynote_address . But this year ' s version -- held last weekend at the Los Angeles Convention Center -- featured an upbeat speech by Theatre LA President Barbara Beckley that could hardly have been more different from Loewenberg ' s . &quot; It was like North and South_Korea , &quot; observed conference organizer Sheldon Metz , who added that he certainly preferred Beckley ' s optimism to Loewenberg ' s gloom and doom . Beckley , who also runs the Colony Studio Theatre , disputed a series of unfavorable &quot; myths &quot; -- &quot; that L.A. is going_to hell , that we can ' t be a theater town because we ' re too spread_out and it ' s all mostly just showcase anyway , that there ' s no major talent here , that Los Angeles Theatre Center is dead and we ' ll never have mid-sized houses , that the audience is finite and our disasters have done us in. &quot; Rebutting the idea that too_much L.A. theater is simply a showcase for the movie and TV industries , she referred to &quot; scores of companies that exist entirely because they want to create interesting new work or contemporary reinterpretations of the classics. &quot; After several weekends of buying out-of-town papers and checking their theater listings , Beckley said it was obvious that there are more productions in L.A. than in New York , Chicago or San Francisco . &quot; New York may have bigger theaters and larger audiences , and Chicago may get more respect -- but we have more productions , more variety , more choice. &quot; She praised the municipal managers of the LATC building and urged producers seeking a space to make LATC &quot; their first call. &quot; Citing efforts by Actors Alley , Glendale authorities , Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre and Actors ' Equity to encourage mid-sized theater production , Beckley predicted that mid-sized theater will be &quot; the Next Great Wave. &quot; Not that Beckley found everything hunky-dory . &quot; The days of governments giving tax dollars to support art for art ' s sake are over , &quot; she declared , &quot; so we we should stop wasting_time and energy rending our garments about it &quot; and instead &quot; give the politicians ways to justify spending those dollars on us &quot; through revitalized neighborhoods , upscale customers , community identity . She talked at length about the importance of extending extra courtesies to audiences as well as doing &quot; good work. &quot; The idea that the audience is finite &quot; is just a crock . . . . There are millions of people in L.A. , most of them potential theatergoers . We just have to find them , cultivate them , turn them into theatergoers and keep them coming back. &quot; GNU ON FILM : It might be interesting to hear Beckley ' s reaction to &quot; Rave Review , &quot; the first fictional feature_film within memory that ' s set primarily within the L.A. theater scene . The movie will be unveiled locally Friday at two screenings during the AFI Film Fest at Laemmle ' s Monica 4-Plex . Jeff Seymour ' s movie takes_off from his own experiences running the Gnu Theatre in North Hollywood . His 99-seat theater in the film is called the Gnu , though in fact its theater scenes were shot at the Melrose Theatre in Hollywood ( the real Gnu has since become the Odessa Theatre ) . Some of the actors who performed in Seymour ' s productions at the old Gnu are in the movie , including Ed Begley Jr . and Joe Spano -- who play two stars who deign to do sub-100-seat theater , then desert after one weekend in_order to take movie jobs . However , this film is no documentary about sub-100-seat theater . As the AFI program notes , its plot veers in the direction of &quot; The Player &quot; -- especially after a disreputable L.A. Times critic shows_up in the story . WESTWOOD WATCH : When UCLA bought the Westwood Playhouse last year , the target date for UCLA-produced professional theater there was the fall of 1994 . But now Gilbert Cates , UCLA dean and Westwood artistic director , is aiming for the fall of 1995 , citing fund-raising problems . Nevertheless , he has taken the first_steps toward taking_over the theater . Eric Krebs , the New York-based producer of Westwood programming for nearly five years , has departed , and Cates has hired Lou Moore as the theater ' s new managing director . During the coming year , UCLA will continue to book commercial productions into the theater in an attempt to make a little revenue before it becomes a nonprofit house . Moore hopes a show will be up by September , and she also hopes to reactivate the building ' s restaurant and gift shop. *</TEXT>
