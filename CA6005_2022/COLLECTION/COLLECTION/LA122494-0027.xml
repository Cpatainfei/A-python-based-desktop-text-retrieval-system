   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ' S FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL ; PESO SETTLES AMID FEAR OF SHORT-TERM DAMAGE ; FALLOUT : ONE WALL_STREET FIRM DOWNGRADES THE NATION ' S FOREIGN DEBT . MEXICAN RETAILERS ALREADY BEMOAN A DROP IN HOLIDAY SALES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The peso stabilized on international markets Friday , but the Mexican currency ' s plunge this week led a top Wall_Street firm to cut its rating of Mexico ' s foreign debt and shattered efforts to forecast what will happen to the nation ' s economy in the coming year . Retailers and shoppers here also said the devaluation -- which began Tuesday and drove the peso down nearly 30 % against the U.S. dollar before rising slightly in Friday trading -- cut_into last-minute purchases heading into Mexico ' s bleakest Christmas weekend in recent memory . A sample of the reaction in international financial circles to the Mexican government ' s sudden decision to stop defending the peso , just 24 hours after lifting the trading ceiling on the currency , came from Baring Securities Ltd . It issued a special report Friday titled , &quot; The Mexican Crash. &quot; &quot; Owing to the volatility of exchange and interest_rates , it is unrealistic at this time to produce a plausible economic scenario for 1995 , &quot; the report declared , sharply criticizing the new government of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo for the impact of the free-float . Baring echoed many Mexican economists who believe that Zedillo ' s initial move Monday to expand the peso ' s trading band would have been a sufficiently painful move to adjust an overvalued currency and strengthen Mexico ' s export economy . &quot; There is no doubt that the ( government ' s ) economic management team has lost credibility through its handling of the crisis , &quot; the Baring report stated , adding that confidence can be restored only through the announcement of a credible , new economic plan for the country . Standard &amp; Poor ' s announced Friday that it was lowering to &quot; Double B-plus &quot; its rating on about $ 30 billion worth of Mexico ' s long-term , foreign currency debt , and indicated the rating could fall still further . But S &amp; P struck a more upbeat tone for Mexico ' s long-range economic outlook , noting , &quot; Public finances -- the anchor of Mexico ' s ( economic ) reform program -- are fundamentally strong , with government debt under 25 % of GDP ( gross_domestic_product ) . &quot; Other financial analysts agreed . And J . P . Morgan went a step further , defending Zedillo ' s financial advisers as &quot; one of the best economic teams in the world. &quot; &quot; What the government is attempting to accomplish through the devaluation and the accompanying macroeconomic measures is ( to ) adjust the economy to the new external reality &quot; of international markets , Morgan concluded . But its analysts , too , said the initial impact on the Mexican economy will be slow overall growth and that banks and other corporations with large dollar exposures &quot; will be hurt , in many cases badly. &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , however , when all_the dust has settled and the recriminations have ceased , Mexico will have a much more competitive exchange_rate . . . and a much more viable long-run development strategy than it had before. &quot; The Mexican_peso stabilized against the dollar as panic about the country ' s financial crisis ebbed . The peso was last quoted at 4.6750 pesos to the dollar , stronger than 4.80 pesos , where it was quoted late Thursday . At that level , the peso buys 21.05 cents , down 27 % from 28.87 cents a week ago . The Mexican Stock_Market also stabilized after a roller-coaster week of heavy trading . The Bolsa index on Friday edged_up 1.54 % .</TEXT>
