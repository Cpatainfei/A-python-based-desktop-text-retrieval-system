   <HEADLINE> REAGAN ' S DISCLOSURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All Americans must be shaken , and saddened , by news that former President Ronald Reagan is battling with Alzheimer ' s disease ( Nov . 6 ) . And to those feelings , they must add admiration and respect . With characteristic courage , Reagan has openly acknowledged his illness and the burden that it inevitably places on his wife , family and other loved ones . Unfortunately , this disease still has no effective treatment , and no means of prevention . But to borrow one of President Reagan ' s favorite metaphors , the dawn of discovery in neuroscience is beginning to lift the darkness of this dread disease . Progress has been so rapid and promising that we may be permitted to hope that some of its first benefits may come_in time to lighten Reagan ' s journey . Toward the end of 1992 , 133 of America ' s preeminent neuroscientists , under the aegis of the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives , publicly stated their conviction that , by the year 2000 , neuroscience could expect to have discovered the defective genes in familial Alzheimer ' s disease and have developed new drugs and other measures to alleviate the symptoms of all versions of Alzheimer ' s . Recent progress strongly confirms their confidence . Just last year , for example , the first major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer ' s was uncovered -- the E4 version of the APOE gene . Now that at least one marker for genetic risk has been identified , scientists are able , for the first time , to do comparative studies on people who carry that risk marker , as well as studies within the population of those who already have developed the disease . The ultimate target of this research : discover methods to delay onset of the illness ; formulate medications to enable patients to live longer , more functional lives ; and perhaps even correct defective genes . Until that longed-for day , all Americans should pray for the President and his family . He has served us once more . DAVID MAHONEY , Chairman Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives New York</TEXT>
