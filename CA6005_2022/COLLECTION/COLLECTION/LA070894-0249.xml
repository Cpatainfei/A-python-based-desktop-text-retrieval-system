   <HEADLINE> CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE : REALTY COMPANY CHARGING CLIENTS $ 250 ' SERVICES FEE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Citing increased costs , Jon Douglas Co . has begun charging real_estate clients a $ 250 &quot; professional services fee &quot; on top of agents ' usual commission . It is believed to be the first time a brokerage in Southern California has levied fees on clients . The company said it is imposing the fee regardless of whether a client is buying a property or selling one . In real_estate transactions , only the seller pays a commission , typically 6 % of the sales price . The Beverly Hills-based brokerage said it expects competitors to follow its move . However , one rival brokerage said it has no intention of doing so . &quot; I ' m having trouble with the idea of hitting a buyer for $ 250 when interest_rates are up a bit , &quot; said Fred Sands , president of Fred Sands Co . of West Los Angeles . The fee signals that although the real_estate market has picked_up somewhat , brokers are still having a tough time . Prices remain below the peaks of five years ago , meaning brokerages make less money than they used to on each transaction . Jon Douglas said the fee will help cover the cost of improving its technology and services offered to clients . The company said the fee replaces a 5 % transaction charge levied on agents to help cover overhead . Other brokerages charge their agents similar fees . Lou Piatt , executive_vice_president of Jon Douglas , said no customers have balked at paying the fee since it was instituted two weeks ago . He said the fee is insignificant compared to the price of a home . Apparently Douglas agents having good_luck with tips contained in a booklet Jon Douglas distributed to them when it announced the fee . In the booklet , titled &quot; Agents ' Guide to Professional Services Fee , &quot; agents are advised how to handle client objections . &quot; You are trained to sell , and we expect you to get the professional services fee from the client . . . , &quot; the booklet says . &quot; Compare this fee to all_the other fees associated with a closing : escrow fees , title fees , loan processing fees , appraisal fees , etc. &quot; Agents are also told not to worry about losing clients to brokerages that don ' t levy fees . Competitors &quot; will most likely introduce their own professional services fee as soon as we ' ve shown_the_way , &quot; the guide says . &quot; We feel that clients will simply take the fee in stride. &quot; Agents are cautioned that they will be required to pay the fee if the client refuses to do so . * When the cat gets_out : The case of the missing cat aboard a Tower Air jetliner offers a reminder that airlines treat lost pets as baggage claims . Last week , 3-year-old Tabitha apparently escaped_from her cage_in the plane ' s cargo hold and disappeared into a space that separates a storage compartment from the fuselage . Owner Carol Ann Timmel of Beverly Hills could not persuade Tower Air to ground the plane until Tabitha could be found . The airline did allow the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to set traps for the cat . The cat has not turned_up . Timmel has little recourse but to file a lost-baggage claim . Travelers who lose pets are compensated for what the pet is worth , up_to a maximum of $ 1 # 250 . The airlines say about 500 # 000 pets travel each year and that few are lost . The Transportation Department does not track missing-pet reports , but it said it has received one consumer complaint about a missing pet during the first five months of this year . Travelers with very small pets can keep_an_eye_on them when flying . According to the Air Transport Assn. , an industry group , most airlines permit travelers to stow pets under cabin seats if the cages are small enough , although arrangements must usually be made in_advance . * The bear facts : A Pasadena company has redesigned its bear-shaped honey bottles to make room for a new nutrition label . Jack ' s Honey Bee Products is hoping the labels will give its products an edge over competing brands . As reported here in May , honey packagers using bear-shaped bottles are exempt from the government ' s new nutrition labeling rules . The new labels are required for most foods and contain information about calories , fat , sodium , carbohydrates and certain other nutrients . Jack ' s Honey President C . Byron Capps doesn ' t think consumers will be deterred by the revelation that honey contains 60 calories per tablespoon -- more_than sugar . Capps points_out that the nutrition label also tells consumers that honey contains no fat . &quot; that ' s what people really care about , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
