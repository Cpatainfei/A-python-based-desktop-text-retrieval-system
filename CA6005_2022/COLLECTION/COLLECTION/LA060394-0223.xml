   <HEADLINE> CLINTON ' S ROME VISIT TURNS INTO FAMIGLIA AFFAIR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So he chatted with the Pope , captivated clerics , hobnobbed with a billionaire prime_minister and supped of one of the world ' s great cuisines . Abroad in the hot streets of this city Thursday , it was mostly Roman passersby and accidental tourists who witnessed President Clinton ' s visit to celebrate what he characterized as an extraordinary , all-in-the-family relationship between the United States and Italy . Indeed , Clinton seemed as much awe-struck as awe-inspiring to Romans as he made a relaxed , tourist-like debut in the Eternal City . &quot; I came all they way from Omaha , Neb. , to see this . I can ' t believe it ! The tour director had tickets for the President , so we just abandoned the tour , &quot; said Morine Dosert in the majestic Piazza Campidoglio , where Clinton spoke in front of Rome ' s City_Hall . If Romans behaved almost as if an old friend had dropped_in to call , not all_of them were pleased . Clinton was not good news for Kavir Ahmed , who makes his living on the sidewalk inscribing &quot; Your Name on a Grain of Rice. &quot; &quot; A tourist from Vienna named Kurt had me put his name on one side of a grain and Clinton ' s on the other , but business is lousy . A lot of people are staying away , and the rest don ' t seem to care that he ' s here , &quot; said Ahmed , a 28-year-old Bangladeshi . Central Rome in offhanded fashion digested the friendly invasion by a President commanding more limousines and security cars than Hannibal had elephants . People went_to work . Ugly orange buses growled messily . Motorini buzzed busily . Helicopters coptered . Everybody knew that Clinton would make the traffic worse , if that is possible . He did . There were U.S. flags here and there , cops galore , bunches of people , but few crowds to speak_of except at the Campidoglio . There , in a folksy speech partially translated by Budget Director Leon Panetta , an Italian American , Clinton evoked Marc Antony ' s &quot; Friends , Romans and countrymen , &quot; hailing Italians , in Italian , as Alleati , amici , una famiglia . ( Allies , friends , family. ) &quot; I shaked his hand , &quot; shouted Jude Jeyankachan , 10 , with greater exuberance than grammatical nicety . A police band played &quot; Cheek to Cheek &quot; as Clinton warmly greeted seven Romans born_on June 4 , 1944 -- the World_War_II liberation of Rome by U.S. troops -- and all named Italian variations of &quot; America. &quot; &quot; From the hearty atmosphere and the number of people here , America is alive and well in Rome , &quot; said Sister Brigid Murphy , a teacher at Marymount International School amid a forest of Italian and U.S. flags in front of City_Hall . Like Hillary Clinton , who swapped M &amp; M ' s for smiles with chanting , delighted Italian school kids in the Piazza Navona ( &quot; EE-la-ree ! EE-la-ree ! &quot; the children cried ) , the President seemed to enjoy the experience at every stop on a cloudless Roman day more summer than spring . &quot; It ' s unbelievable , &quot; said Clinton , enjoying Michelangelo ' s restored frescoes in the Sistine Chapel . Even a long news_conference with new Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi , one of Europe ' s richest_men , was outdoors in a landmark 17th-Century courtyard of the distinguished old Palazzo Chigi . Then on to a glittery , caloric , black-tie state dinner in a Renaissance villa designed by Raffaello . At the height of Rome ' s tourist season , many who saw Clinton on Thursday just happily happened_upon him . &quot; The first President I ' ll have seen since L.B.J. , &quot; said Jim Tudor of Chicago , who stopped in curiosity on Via del Corso and was rewarded with a motorcade . Thomas Kubik , a German in from Frankfurt for a long weekend , observed of the President : &quot; He ' s worth waiting for ; some of us see him as a new J.F.K. &quot; &quot; Splendid advertising for us , &quot; said Raffaele Ciarelli , leading a demonstration for immigrants ' rights that city authorities had unaccountably forgotten to reschedule for another day . Clinton , who jogged his way through jet-lag in a red baseball_cap and a gray T-shirt that said &quot; Radio City , &quot; got his first view of the day of the Italian_capital from a famous hilltop lookout called the Pincio . After his encounter with a stiff , frail-looking Pope recovering from a broken thigh , Clinton was buoyant and beaming in an encounter with 140 American priests and seminarians . Striding into a baroque salon at the Apostolic Palace , the President told the clerics that his encounter with John Paul was &quot; an awe-inspiring experience. &quot; When Raymond Flynn , former Boston mayor and U.S. ambassador to the Vatican , assured Clinton that all_the priests were Democrats , Clinton turned_to accompanying Cardinal Angelo Sodano and joked : &quot; After that political comment he ( Flynn ) made , he has another good reason to go_to confession now. &quot; Speaking off the cuff , Clinton , a Baptist graduate of a Catholic university , lavished praise on the Roman_Catholic_Church in the United States . &quot; The church has brought_together faith and action , word and deed , bringing_together people across the lines of rich and poor , of racial lines and other lines perhaps better than any other institution in our society , &quot; he said . He commended the clerics for the &quot; ultimate commitment of your entire lives in the service of that in which you believe . . . . I stand here today to tell you that , as an American President , I am immensely proud_of the commitment you have made. &quot; The Rev . Christopher Coyne of Boston had praise for Clinton , saying he was &quot; very eloquent . I think he spoke from the heart. &quot; As he swept_through Rome , Clinton received both the deference and the familiarity that his presence and demeanor encouraged . At the Vatican , &quot; gentlemen of honor &quot; stood at attention in morning_coats . Swiss Guards in plumed helmets hammered their halberds in salute . And yet , by late afternoon , when Berlusconi invited Clinton to address a news_conference , the Italian prime_minister turned_to the leader of the Free_World and said in English : &quot; Please , Bill. &quot;</TEXT>
