   <HEADLINE> SIGHTS ; EXHIBIT OF LATINO WORKS HAS A MYSTICAL QUALITY ; PAINTINGS AT CARNEGIE ART MUSEUM IN OXNARD ARE IN DIFFERENT STYLES , BUT ALL PORTRAY EXPRESSIONS OF INNER LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At present , the Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard is genuinely abuzz with paintings that are not , by any definition , wallflowers . Vivid color_schemes , large scale and bold imagery -- pushing at the limits of realism -- make_for art that strains to leap off the wall and escape the boundaries of two dimensions . And that ' s the point . A unicorn is flanked by El Salvadoran soldiers in Frank Romero ' s huge triptych , &quot; Espirito del Pueblo , &quot; based on the 15th-Century &quot; Lady of the Unicorn. &quot; In Elizabeth Perez ' s &quot; Heard in_Hand , &quot; a nude woman holds a heart in her hand , an unequivocal symbol of love lost . Literally stretching into three dimensions , Margaret Garcias &quot; In the City of the Angels &quot; is a wooden wardrobe painted with scenes of violence and peril contrasted with natural imagery , with angel wings hung inside . But what distinguishes &quot; The Mystical in Art : Chicano / Latino Painting , &quot; one of the finest shows yet hung at the Carnegie , is not its extroverted initial impression . As the show ' s title suggests , at_issue is the expression of inner life , via religious , psychological , mythological , or art-referential windows . Curator Frank Romero sought to illustrate the theme of mysticism as represented in the work of 13 Chicano and Latino painters , mostly from Southern California . Romero , a well-known artist based in East L . A. , was last seen in a one-man show at the Carnegie Art Museum in 1992 . Romero ' s work includes the &quot; Going_to the Olympics &quot; mural on the Hollywood Freeway near Downtown Los Angeles . He is working_on a mural for the Metro Red_Line Station in L . A . The paintings in his previous show had a generally boisterous presence , but the works_at the Carnegie use the Mixografia print-making technique to create delicate images of primitive icons . Paradoxes often arise in considering these artists , who tend to work in various media and deal with complex issues . Slippery cross-referencing between image , meaning and historical contexts is common . Culturally , the art here often taps into the Latin_American literary legacy of magic_realism , using techniques of prickly realism , all shuffled , to expand beyond the surface reality . There is also an obvious link to the contemporary art world , with the revitalized narrative emphasis of postmodernist painting . Eloy Torrez , for instance , draws_on Baroque and Renaissance painting mannerisms and traditions for his pieces , but also tosses_in a contemporary spin . The triptych &quot; Damnation of the Spirit &quot; depicts a group of nudes , none too coy , basking in the mysterious light of dusk on a beach . &quot; Spirits of Silverlake &quot; shows a back-yard Bacchanalian revelry replete with accordionist and winged spirits . Like Romero , Yreina Cervantes is known for her mural work . But for this show , she is represented by small watercolor pieces such_as her &quot; Homage to Frida Kahlo. &quot; The celebrated Mexican artist Kahlo -- who could not bear children -- is seen nude and pregnant with twins , and holding a mirror_image of Cervantes ' own face . Hence , Kahlo is commemorated as a matriarchal presence . Patssi Valdez , whose paintings here are among the show ' s most compelling , is also a photographer and member of the Chicano Art_Movement and ASCO ( Spanish for nausea ) . In her feverish interior scenes , Valdez illustrates dream-like discomforts of home -- all skewed angles and supercharged color . &quot; La Noche de la Sandia &quot; finds a room clutched by irrational , diagonal lines and sharp corners , as if seen_through a heightened awareness and implying either fear or altered consciousness . Venezuela-born Luchita Hurtado ' s paintings are some of the gentlest of the lot . She paints swatches of blue_sky , viewable from any angle , as if seen_through cave openings . Only floating feathers provide middle ground perspective . Nancy Romero ' s work ranges from a depiction of a Taos Pueblo religious_ceremony , conspicuous on the museum ' s back wall , to intimate pieces upstairs . Her sly still_life , &quot; Ripe Fruit , &quot; finds Our Lady of Guadalupe nestled among fruit on a table -- the merging of religious vision and everyday life . Ann Chamberlain ' s enigmatic and relatively tiny pieces , in the upstairs gallery , tend to be dwarfed by the larger works in the show , but her art commands close attention . Chamberlain mixes and dislodges archetypes , but in a charmingly naive style that is as whimsical as it is didactic . &quot; Portland Man , &quot; both funky and extravagant-looking in oil and gold_leaf on wood , portrays a huge mythical figure towering over Portland -- Portlandia meets Godzilla meets Paul_Bunyan . Her images , sometimes inspired by film , evoke intentionally ambiguous story lines and the sort of dryly irrational world of surrealist Giorgio De Chirico . Generally , such is the lay of the artistic land , full of inexplicable -- or at least interpretively open-ended -- events and scenes . Mystical , in this case , has many different meanings , and somewhere in that matrix of potential meanings lies the pulsing heart of the show . Suffice to say , a visit to this exhibition is bound to be anything but a passive art-watching experience . On a local note , Romero is judging a &quot; Ventura County Chicano / Latino Painting Competition &quot; in connection with the exhibit , with an award presentation on Friday at 7 p.m. For information , call 385-8157 .
