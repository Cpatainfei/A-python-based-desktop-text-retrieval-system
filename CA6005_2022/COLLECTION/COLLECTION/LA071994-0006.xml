   <HEADLINE> SCREENING ROOM ; ' COMING_OUT ' DOCUMENTS WWII GAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Arthur Dong ' s informative , consciousness-raising &quot; Coming Out Under Fire &quot; ( at the Nuart Thursday through July 27 ) documents the experiences of nine gay and lesbian World_War_II veterans amid a plethora of archival footage and framed within the context of the recent and ongoing debate over gays in the military . All the men and women state that they had no problems getting_along_with straights , many of whom assumed their sexual orientation and were not upset by it , but that they lived_in constant fear of being denounced and subjected_to the Draconian anti-gay regulations established early in the war . Most left the service with well-earned honorable discharges , but several were not so fortunate , bearing scars from those experiences to this day . Yet if a gay male didn ' t lie to get_into the service , the alternative was to be sent home bearing the stigma of &quot; sexual pervert. &quot; Dong , who based his film on Allan Berube ' s 1990 book of the same name , makes clear that World_War_II was the first time gays and lesbians were brought_together in large_numbers ; this breaking_down of isolation laid the foundation for the eventual gay_liberation_movement . Since Dong ' s film is only 87 minutes long , he might well have interviewed straight World_War_II veterans as_to their attitudes toward gays and lesbians in the ranks and also underlined the fact that ongoing discriminatory policies in the military provide impetus for other kinds of anti-gay legislation .

In the course of interviewing , in a mere two hours , 74 musicians , artists ' managers , club owners , DJs , critics and even a simpatico retired cop , Veneruso reminds us of what a major music capital Austin has long been , cradle of everything from blues to punk_rock to current alternative music . &quot; Janis Joplin Slept Here &quot; makes you wish you had been to local landmark clubs , past and present , where you could enjoy everyone from Muddy Waters , the Sex Pistols , Johnny Winter , Bruce Springsteen ( &quot; when he was just a long name &quot; ) , Stevie Ray Vaughn to Joplin herself -- not to mention scores more . Joplin was just one of numerous Texas performers who would migrate to San Francisco in the late ' 60s ; at that time Austin also produced several key masters of psychedelic poster art . Information : ( 213 ) 466-6232 . * Malcolm X Documentary : &quot; Brother Minister : The Assassination of Malcolm X &quot; ( at the Sunset 5 at noon only for one week starting Friday ) is a powder_keg of a documentary directed by Jack Baxter , a former private_investigator , who co-produced and co-wrote the film with Jefri Aalmuhammed , a Black Muslim who was a consultant on Spike Lee ' s &quot; Malcolm X. &quot; In a series of interviews with Malcolm X ' s colleagues , coupled with much potent and often rare archival materials , the filmmakers raise many unanswered questions surrounding the assassination of Malcolm X in February , 1965 , in Harlem ' s Audubon Ballroom , where the charismatic Black Muslim leader , who had broken from Elijah Muhammad and his Nation of Islam , was to speak_to followers of_his_own Organization of Afro-American Unity . &quot; Brother Minister &quot; brings considerable clarity to an exceedingly complex , highly charged event , pointing a lot of fingers along the way and suggesting that the death of the ever-evolving Malcolm was a tragic loss to the ranks of African American leaders . At the very least , the film makes a strong case for a congressional investigation into Malcolm ' s assassination . Information : ( 213 ) 848-3500 .</TEXT>
