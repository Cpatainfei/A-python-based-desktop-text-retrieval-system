   <HEADLINE> TO HELL AND BACK WITH ROD STEIGER ; RECOVERY : APPEARING AT UCI , THE ACTOR TALKS ABOUT HIS CAREER AND HOW IT ALMOST ENDED BECAUSE OF CLINICAL DEPRESSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Picture Rod Steiger . The Oscar-winning actor is still solidly built , powerful looking , at age 69 . His head is shaved clean . His brown eyes come at you like magnetic tractor beams out of a jowly face that softens magically when he smiles . But don ' t picture him smiling . Picture him as &quot; the kind of guy who goes_into a bar and everybody tries to sneak_out the back. &quot; Is this a role that the star of &quot; On the Waterfront , &quot; &quot; The Pawnbroker &quot; and &quot; In the Heat of the Night &quot; has taken_on ? No . This is the person Steiger says he probably would have become , if he hadn ' t become an actor . Or picture him unshaven , unwashed , unspeaking , sitting in a stupor staring at the ocean day in and day out for years . This is the Rod Steiger who suffered from clinical_depression , before drug therapy rendered his disease manageable and allowed him to live again . On stage at the Irvine Barclay Theatre on Saturday night , Steiger shared these and many other visions of his personal life and creativity to benefit the UCI Brain Imaging Center , which produced &quot; An Evening with Rod Steiger &quot; in association with the National Alliance for Research in Schizophrenia and Depression ( NARSAD ) . Steiger first came_to be associated with the BIC last year when he received its Silver Ribbon Award for his unstinting efforts to eliminate the stigma of mental_disease . He has testified before Congress . He has spoken candidly many times on television and on stage . Few audiences could have been_better primed to receive his message than the one at the Barclay , where silver ribbons glinted from nearly every lapel . It was a crowd of psychiatrists , researchers , nurses , activists , fans , but more_than anything else , a gathering of people whose personal lives had been rerouted by the tragedy of mental_illness . They gave Steiger a standing_ovation when he came_in , to which he quipped : &quot; I didn ' t know I had that many relatives. &quot; Answering questions from Prof . Richard Brown , who hosts an interview program on the American Movie Classics channel , Steiger amply embodied his own definition of an actor as a mobile poet . Ensconced in an armchair , he nonetheless communicated passionately , humorously and articulately on his life . His powerful voice threatened to overwhelm the audio equipment . Picture Rod Steiger as a member of Spanky and Our Gang . As Spanky himself , in fact . There was a national competition for the role into which young Rod was entered , &quot; in a big straw_hat , a diaper and a giant pin . And I won ! &quot; he boomed , looking surprised . &quot; I was supposed to go_to Hollywood the next day , but I had a big boil on my rear_end . I fell_down some stairs and burst the boil , got a fever and couldn ' t go . They used the runner-up , and it ' s the best thing that ever happened to me . . . Or you ! &quot; he added , fixing the crowd with his laser-lock eyes . It wasn ' t until years later , after a stint in the military , that he stumbled into his calling . He told of filing used checks_in a civil_service office , a block-long building that employed thousands . He and the boys found_out where all_the good-looking girls were spending their Thursday nights . There was a social program , a little theater group . &quot; Need I say how we descended ? &quot; Steiger growled , rising from his chair , his hands extended like great_bear paws . &quot; I didn ' t want to be an actor . I wanted to do something else. &quot; Fate had plans for him , however -- a cheap rooming_house in Manhattan , acting lessons , and eventually stardom . Fate also pulled him into the &quot; stinking , icy swamp &quot; of chemical depression . After a heart bypass operation in 1979 , something went_wrong . He has a &quot; private theory &quot; that the anesthesia given him during the surgery may have triggered the depression he has suffered ever since . &quot; My mind is so impressionable , &quot; he said , shaking his head . &quot; The man said to me , ' You might have a small depression. ' &quot; Steiger looked_at the audience . &quot; You think I do anything small ? &quot; he asked to a roar of laughter . This is an actor who has played Capone , Napoleon and Pope John . &quot; Small &quot; is not an adjective that springs_to_mind . He said he loves playing historical characters . Far from being intimidated by comparison with the original , he said , he relishes the opportunity for a kind of spiritual fusion . &quot; Suppose you ' re playing Beethoven . If for even a split_second you can feel the way Beethoven felt -- that is such a high ! There ' s no narcotic can match it. &quot; Researching these roles , he added , has given him a better education than most people have , in spite of his one year of high_school . &quot; When I was a kid , we had to go_to art appreciation . Rembrandt , &quot; he sighed . &quot; I was from Newark . I thought Rembrandt was a delicatessen downtown . Yeah , next to Gauguin , the clothes place. &quot; He grew to become an actor whose performances would synthesize paintings , symphonies , poetry . Picasso ' s &quot; Guernica &quot; inspired the famous &quot; silent scream &quot; in Steiger ' s majestic performance as a Holocaust survivor in &quot; The Pawnbroker. &quot; &quot; I saw ' Guernica ' years ago in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and Picasso has those women in profile and their tongues come_out about this far and they ' re sharp , like tacks . That was the loudest damn scream I had ever heard. &quot; When the time came_to shoot the scene , and the script said &quot; he screams , &quot; &quot; I put my head back and I thought_of ' Guernica ' and my instinct said ' Don ' t you make a sound . It ' s the loudest damn scream you ' ve ever done. ' &quot; That scene , one of several in a series of clips that started the program , epitomized a very different kind of silence from the one which engulfed Steiger for eight years in the depths of his depression . He didn ' t want to get_out of bed . When he would come downstairs , he said , he would mutter &quot; good_morning &quot; to his wife , sit and stare at the tea and bagel she would bring him , lose himself in the view of the ocean for eight hours , then mutter &quot; good_night &quot; and go_back to bed . Fueled by a sense of survival , he sought help . &quot; I did one-on-one ( therapy ) for a while . . . then a group. &quot; Neither helped very much . &quot; I was doing a picture and waking_up every morning with icy perspiration . I didn ' t think I could act anymore . I couldn ' t talk to anybody , because the worst thing you could do_in this town is admit weakness. &quot; Finally , he discovered psychopharmacology . He takes medication now , nightly , &quot; whether I like it or not. &quot; But he says it ' s &quot; only oil on the water . There are always some days that are scary -- when the water pops through the oil . &quot; I was lucky , &quot; he pointed_out . &quot; I had the money to bounce around for a while . I don ' t know what poorer people do. &quot; He then recalled that a doctor once told him what poorer people do : &quot; They kill themselves. &quot; Steiger said he was donating his services to the BIC / NARSAD fund-raising_effort because they are doing the kind of research and producing the kinds of drugs that have kept him and many others from seeking that desperate solution . &quot; It ' s a big disease , &quot; he said . * He recalled reading a poem about it before a congressional committee and later on the air for CNN where he dared them to keep the camera on his face for the whole five pages . &quot; And I warn you , &quot; he had challenged them , &quot; I can barely get_through it . I break down. &quot; Afterward , he said , they received more_than 100 phone_calls per hour for days . He said the cause has come_to mean more to him than his acting does . But again , fate has her plans . Steiger ' s career is going_through a rebirth . He is_on his way to Toronto to shoot a film about Margaret Sanger in which he plays her nemesis , a religious fanatic . His film &quot; The Specialist , &quot; in which he co-stars with Sylvester Stallone , Sharon Stone and James Woods , is_due in October . &quot; ' The Specialist ' is like a $ 60 million commercial for me , &quot; he chortled . &quot; ' Hey , ' it ' s saying , ' He ' s still alive. ' &quot; &quot; Alive. &quot; It ' s too small a word for the_likes_of Rod Steiger .</TEXT>
