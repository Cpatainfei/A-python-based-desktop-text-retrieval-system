   <HEADLINE> 4 DECADES LATER , LEGACY OF BROWN VS . TOPEKA IS CLOUDY ; CIVIL RIGHTS : THE BELIEF IN THE BENEFITS OF INTEGRATION IS NOW CORRODED BY A NEW GENERATION OF PROBLEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It opened the modern era of race relations , yet it now seems to belong_to a bygone time , an era when right and wrong itself was as stark as black_and_white . Forty years ago this week -- May 17 , 1954 -- a unanimous Supreme Court struck_down racially segregated education in Brown vs . the Board_of_Education of Topeka , Kan . The historic decision still reverberates through American life . And yet in some respects its echo has grown faint , even discordant . On both sides of the color_line , many say , the belief in integration that the Brown case came_to symbolize has weakened . Today , few leaders of any race place high priority on encouraging greater integration in housing or schools . Approximately two-thirds of African American children still attend schools that have a majority of black or Latino students , largely because patterns of racial separation in housing remain immutable . The Brown case typified the conviction that the key to providing blacks with a better life was expanding civil_rights and eliminating discrimination . Now that belief has been corroded by a new generation of problems not clearly rooted in prejudice and largely beyond the reach of legal remedies , the courts and perhaps government policy of any sort : the loss of low-skill , high-wage jobs to automation and foreign competition and the crashing waves of violence and drug_abuse immersing many inner_cities . Even the decision ' s popular legacy of equal treatment regardless of skin_color casts an ironic shadow through the years . Today , that logic is perhaps more likely to be cited by conservative critics of race-conscious affirmative-action programs . &quot; Brown belonged_to a certain period in American history , but what we confront now is something very different , &quot; said Harvard Law_School professor Randall L . Kennedy , editor of Reconstruction , a journal on race relations . &quot; We know what we don ' t want -- de_jure_segregation , persistent discrimination . When it comes_to what we want , that ' s where we get fuzzy and the conflict breaks out. &quot; Brown ' s signal achievement was to undermine the social legitimacy of state-sanctioned inequality . Overturning the 1896 Supreme Court decision that approved &quot; separate but equal &quot; public facilities for blacks , the high_court ruled_in Brown that in education , segregated facilities were &quot; inherently unequal. &quot; The court followed with decisions striking down segregation in other public facilities , clearing the way for the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act that buried the last vestiges of Jim Crow and outlawed discrimination in employment and education . Now , the notion that all Americans should be treated alike not only under the law but in personal_relations &quot; is not just an accepted principle , it is a valued principle , &quot; said political pollster Geoff Garin . &quot; If you think_about where the country was 40 years ago , it ' s striking that in every major Southern city people watch the news every night delivered by an African American anchor and never think_twice about it. &quot; But many whites have never accepted to the same degree the corollary of Brown ' s logic : that integration in schools and other aspects of life was a positive good for society , Garin and other opinion analysts say . Those attitudes bounded Brown ' s impact . After the initial Brown decision failed to meaningfully promote desegregation , the Supreme Court in 1968 and 1971 compelled school districts to move affirmatively toward integration , with busing plans if necessary . But in the Milliken vs . Bradley case involving Detroit , the court ruled_in 1974 that federal_courts could not order busing between cities and their suburbs merely to achieve racial balance in the schools ; the courts had to first find that the racial separation developed from acts of official discrimination . That decision etched the limit of Brown ' s reach -- and accelerated the resettling of urban_areas into predominantly black inner_cities ringed by largely white suburbs , many experts believe . &quot; Once Milliken came_down , it was clear that once whites could withdraw across a municipal boundary , there was no way to promote integration in schools unless you promote integration in housing , and we as a society have been unwilling to do that over the past two decades , &quot; said Douglas S . Massey , a sociologist at the University of Chicago who has extensively studied residential housing patterns . Residential separation by race remains intense : Though some middle-class blacks have moved_into formerly white suburbs , Massey said , the overall level of segregation in cities like Chicago , Detroit , New York , Cleveland and St . Louis remains as great as 40 years ago , and in such Southern cities as Birmingham , Ala. , housing segregation is actually rising . Those housing patterns , combined with demographic trends like the powerful influx of Latino students , have hollowed Brown ' s promise in most urban school districts : According to a National School_Boards Assn . survey conducted late last year , more_than two-thirds of all black students attend schools that are primarily made_up of minority pupils -- the highest figure since 1968 . In the Northeast , where separation is most intense , half of the black students attend schools where at least nine out of every 10 students are members of minority groups . &quot; You basically had no serious sustained effort to desegregate outside the South , &quot; said Gary Orfield , a Harvard_University education professor . &quot; You never had a national Administration committed to enforcing it seriously. &quot; Integration appears to be receding as a priority for blacks too . In a recent Gallup survey for USA Today , roughly 2-to-1 majorities of blacks said they would rather strengthen neighborhood schools than increase efforts at integration . A recent Russell Sage Foundation survey of African Americans found that three out of five support the creation of all-black male academies within public_school systems . On college campuses , minority students now often seek affirmative segregation in separate dorms , student organizations and ethnically based academic_departments . &quot; When you look_at the way these kids have latched onto some of the black nationalists , you get the sense that the rejection of integration by major forces in society makes them feel they have to go it alone , &quot; said Ronald Walters , chairman of the political_science department at Howard University , a historically black college in Washington . If faith in integration has waned since 1954 , so too has the belief that ensuring civil_rights is the key to narrowing the divides between blacks_and_whites . Today , there ' s much less consensus that the most troubling trends in the black community are grounded in discrimination -- and thus capable of being reversed by the kind of legal_action Brown symbolized . Though affirmative_action and other legal strategies have enlarged the black middle_class , such programs offer less practical help to African Americans trapped in poor neighborhoods where family structure and social order have substantially broken_down and industrial restructuring has decimated high-wage manufacturing jobs . Even some sympathetic analysts view the continuing legal battles over discrimination as far less important than combatting problems such_as the explosion in gang-related violence . &quot; What ' s wrong with black America has nothing to do with rights , &quot; said historian David J . Garrow , author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Dr. Martin_Luther_King Jr . &quot; It is largely internally generated and will require a kind of fundamental cultural change that is going_to come very slowly. &quot; Massey dissents , arguing that those negative cultural trends derive from the continued isolation of most blacks into segregated neighborhoods -- and that such isolation is itself rooted in continued housing and lending discrimination . &quot; If you segregate and isolate people . . . you build_in these self-perpetuating cycles of violence and social pathology , &quot; he said . Massey ' s concerns are the same that inspired the lawsuits that led to the Brown decision : overt discrimination denying minorities equal treatment under the law . But since Brown , much of the civil_rights debate has shifted to different terrain : whether , to overcome past discrimination or encourage diversity , it is appropriate to grant minorities preferences in hiring and college-admissions decisions . In the Brown decision , the Supreme Court carefully avoided ruling that the Constitution prohibits government from making any distinctions on the basis of race . But the decision was received as bearing precisely the message that all Americans , regardless of race , should be treated equally under the law . That standard shaped the Civil Rights Act . But starting with President Lyndon B . Johnson ' s 1965 commencement address at Howard University , liberals have argued that government has to grant racial preferences in employment and education to produce &quot; equality as a result &quot; not &quot; just legal equity. &quot; With that historic switch , Brown ' s legacy became confused and contested . In one of its briefs in the case , the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People suggested it was unconstitutional when government &quot; confers or denies benefits on the basis of color or race. &quot; Now conservatives routinely cite that argument against affirmative-action plans the civil_rights movement promotes . &quot; There has been this incredible flip-flop , &quot; said Linda Chavez , executive_director of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission under President Ronald Reagan . &quot; The whole point of Brown and the civil_rights movement was to make race irrelevant . Now we have come full circle and there is an attempt to elevate race and ethnicity to a category of ultimate importance. &quot; As candidate and as President , Bill_Clinton ' s instinct has been to leave undisturbed the liberal consensus behind affirmative_action -- seeking neither its expansion nor retrenchment . But in other respects , he is moving_back toward the idea of common opportunities and standards that some see as Brown ' s essence . Clinton ' s agenda combines programs aimed at increasing opportunity without regard_to race -- such_as job training and expanded tax_credits for the working poor -- with tougher enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in housing and credit . It also calls_for moral renewal and personal responsibility . As with Brown itself , many question whether those programs and exhortations are sufficient to bridge the chasm between white and black Americans . Indeed , there is precious little optimism that any group along the ideological spectrum holds the key to that lock . That mist of despair marks the most stark contrast from 40 years ago . For an earlier generation , the Supreme Court ' s majestic Brown decision illuminated a path to equality through the dismantling of segregation . Today , Brown ' s beacon has dimmed , and in the gloom lurks the fear that no one knows which road now leads to racial reconciliation .
