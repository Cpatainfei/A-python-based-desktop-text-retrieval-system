   <HEADLINE> MILITARY_SERVICE IS SHUNNED IN SPAIN ; EUROPE : UNDER FRANCISCO FRANCO , ANY MENTION OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION MIGHT HAVE LANDED A YOUNG_MAN IN JAIL . NOW THE DODGE IS SO COMMON THAT SOME SPANIARDS FEEL IT COULD DESTROY THE ARMY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just 20 years ago , when Francisco Franco ruled and the military was all-powerful , it was unthinkable for a young Spaniard to dodge compulsory military_service . Now , thousands do_it every year . Of the 200 # 000 youths in the eligible pool , 45 # 000 have declared themselves conscientious_objectors so far in 1994 , an increase of 75 % over last year , the Defense Ministry reported . Draftees make_up 50 % of Spain ' s 217 # 000 military_personnel , and nearly three-quarters of the 145 # 000 in the army . Until Franco died in 1975 , the mere mention of conscientious objection might have landed a young_man in jail . Now , avoiding military_service is so common that some Spaniards feel it could destroy the army . Continued growth of the practice &quot; will certainly lead to a collapse in the forces , &quot; said Francisco Castanon of the Soldiers Defense Office , a private agency that looks_after the legal_rights of draftees . He said many barracks are virtually empty and some officers have no troops to command . Although they cite ideological reasons , most young Spaniards appear to have more personal motives for avoiding the required nine months of military_service . &quot; More and more young people are simply starting to realize what a waste the ' mili ' is and the problems it causes in your professional and family life , &quot; said Jose Moya Sanchez , 23 , of the Movement of Conscientious_Objectors . Many employers will not hire men subject_to the draft , and objectors often must wait years to discharge their 13 months of alternative public_service because there are too many for the number of positions . About 5 # 000 so-called &quot; insubordinates &quot; have rejected both the military and alternative service ; as a result , they are legally viewed_as deserters . A few have been tried and convicted , but their imprisonment has aroused public opposition . Anti-draft movements are strong in several other European_countries , particularly Germany , but none has experienced such a rapid_growth in refusal to serve . It has forced Prime_Minister Felipe Gonzalez to face a question his government has been accused of dodging since it came_to power in 1982 : What type of military is appropriate for democratic Spain ? Much of the reluctance to tamper with the military dates_from 1981 , a year before the Socialists , when elements of the paramilitary Civil Guard and army seized Parliament in an attempted coup . &quot; The government has always been afraid of meddling with the army -- first , because of the dictatorship and the 1981 coup , but also because it ' s nervous about having a truly professional and efficient army , &quot; said Amadeo Martinez Ingles , a retired colonel . Martinez Ingles was forced to retire in 1989 after publishing &quot; Defenseless Spain , &quot; in which he advocates scrapping the draft for a small , better-trained professional force . In the book , which helped create the objectors ' movement , Martinez Ingles contends the army is so poorly equipped and overloaded with non-professionals that it could not repel even a minimal attack . Along with many other Spaniards , however , Martinez Ingles believes the government might encounter strong resistance to a smaller army from high-ranking officers who fear losing power , influence , even their jobs . Lately , the government seems to have taken a page or two from the colonel ' s book . It has reduced compulsory service from 13 months to nine and improved the living conditions of draftees to_the_point of giving them weekends off . The latest government attempt to reform the military is a reorganization plan devised by army_officers and the Defense Ministry . It would retain a force of half draftees and half professionals , but reduce the army from 145 # 000 men to 90 # 000 over six years . The plan would change the army ' s orientation to national defense from its historic role of keeping the populace under_control . Analysts welcome the idea of ending the traditional concentration of military_installations around major cities and the reduction in personnel , but believe even more reform is necessary . Many say the goal should be an efficient force that serves Europe as well as Spain . According to Moya Sanchez of the objectors ' movement , most young Spaniards look_upon compulsory service as senseless training for confronting an imaginary enemy . &quot; People are not objecting to the military_service because it ' s hard , but because it ' s meaningless , &quot; he said . &quot; You don ' t even learn how to shoot a gun properly. &quot;</TEXT>
