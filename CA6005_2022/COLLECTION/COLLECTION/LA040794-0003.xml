   <HEADLINE> CAN NATO BE DECISIVE AGAIN ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the 4th Century BC , the political orator Demosthenes , speaking at a time of peril in the life of Athens , told his fellow citizens that they were like a clumsy boxer always moving his fists to shield the last place struck . In addressing the Bosnian crisis , Gen . John Shalikashvili , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , could use a lesson from Demosthenes . Peace became imaginable in Bosnia for the first time when NATO , implementing a longstanding U.N. resolution , delivered an ultimatum to the Serbs about their Sarajevo artillery . In plain English , it was &quot; Move it or lose it. &quot; The Serbs moved it . Optimists then proposed that similar ultimatums be issued elsewhere in Bosnia . Pessimists predicted that the Serbs would move their firepower to other Muslim or Croat targets . What immediately followed was neither . It was an unexpected reconciliation between Bosnia ' s Muslims and its Croats and a new peace momentum . Within the last few weeks , however , the predictions of the post-Sarajevo pessimists have come_to pass : savage ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Banja Luka and a Serb siege of the Muslim enclaves of Maglaj and Gorazde . The slaughter now taking_place in Gorazde is comparable_to the slaughter that prompted decisive action at Sarajevo . Can NATO be decisive again ? Shalikashvili says no . NATO air strikes , he says , could be effective against Serbian artillery at Sarajevo but would not be against the infantry doing the killing in Gorazde . But must NATO be Demosthenes ' boxer ? Must Gorazde ' s defense come at Gorazde ? We think not . We urge the Clinton_Administration to call_on NATO to deliver to the Serbs the kind of Gorazde ultimatum that could stop the siege overnight : Lift the siege or prepare_for air_attack . Where ? On what ? That should be for NATO to know and the Serbs to find_out . Serb military assets are many . NATO knows where they are . Shalikashvili claims that this course would make NATO a belligerent on one side in a conflict in which it must maintain neutrality . This is nonsense . NATO is not neutral . If it were , the Sarajevo ultimatum could never have come_about . The &quot; evenhanded &quot; neutralization of the virtually nonexistent Bosnian artillery along with the potent Serbian artillery at Sarajevo was a transparent charade . For the rest of its self-defense , Bosnia does not need U.S. ground troops . It needs a U.S. President who will take seriously the Senate ' s 87-9 approval in February of a non-binding resolution calling_for a unilateral U.S. lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia . Ideally , a NATO Gorazde ultimatum would come_in tandem with a lifting of the embargo by all_the NATO members . Failing that , the Clinton_Administration should offer its NATO allies a choice : Either issue a Gorazde ultimatum ( an existing U.N. resolution is all_the authorization needed ) or plan on a unilateral U.S. lifting of the Bosnian embargo -- and therewith , sadly , a tacit loss of U.S. confidence in NATO itself .</TEXT>
