   <HEADLINE> GLOBOCARS : THE NEXT CENTURY ; AUTO_MAKERS DRIVE FOR NEW_WORLD MARKETS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The automobile is a century old and showing no signs of putting_on the brakes . More_than 600 million vehicles roam the roads -- from Germany ' s high-speed autobahns and America ' s interstates to the gridlocked streets of Thailand and unpaved byways of interior Brazil . Last year about 50 million cars , trucks and other vehicles -- an average of 135 # 000 each day -- were driven_off the world ' s production_lines . Two-thirds came from U.S. , European and Japanese factories , but an increasing number were built_in Southeast_Asia and Latin_America . With their home markets overrun_with cars , major auto_makers are driving relentlessly into new markets . Aided by globe-shrinking technologies and communications , the push for profits is creating far-flung operations where both risks and potential payoffs are great . &quot; Companies that don ' t think globally will be left_behind , &quot; said John F . Smith , president and chief_executive of General Motors . &quot; And so will the countries whose policies impede rather than encourage companies to do so. &quot; The automobile , almost since its infancy in the 1890s , has been the engineering wonder and then the economic engine of the developed world . No other industry turns_out a consumer product that requires such a vast array of materials , processes and technologies or such large amounts of capital , labor and allied businesses . Not surprisingly , the allure is intoxicating for emerging nations with growing middle_classes . For them , the auto industry is a jobs machine capable of propelling their people to prosperity and worldly status . The sheer size of some untapped markets has car_makers salivating . China has 20 % of the world ' s population but less than 1 % of its vehicles . Sales are expected to triple by 2000 to 3 million annually . Like desserts , anything this good must be bad , and the auto industry ' s projected growth has a dark side -- congestion and pollution . Traffic is so bad in Bangkok that the 15-mile trip into town from Don Muang Airport can take three hours . The skylines of Los Angeles , Mexico_City and Jakarta are darkened by smog largely caused by vehicle exhaust . &quot; There is increasing social demand on the auto industry to civilize its products , &quot; said Jim Olsen , vice_president of Toyota ' s U.S. subsidiary . These and other pressures are helping redraw the map for the industry as it enters the 21st Century . Here are some of the road signs guiding it into the future : * The United States , Europe and Japan are mature markets with sales growth_rates averaging just 1 % to 2 % yearly . With worldwide overcapacity , a company can expand only by taking market share from a rival or moving_into new markets . * Globalization means more consolidation and strategic alliances as car_makers seek to share costs and spread risk . Efforts are mounting to build &quot; world cars , &quot; models that can be sold in multiple markets with only minor changes . * Southeast_Asia is the world ' s hottest market . But the most coveted prizes are China and India . Latin_America also has great potential . Economic and political concerns make Russia and Eastern Europe unattractive now . * Trade_barriers are coming_down in emerging nations . Trade frictions will continue to flare_up , especially involving big exporters like Japan . To ease tensions , firms are moving production into the countries where their vehicles are sold . * Environmental and technological pressures are mounting on auto_makers worldwide , including those of absolutists who say : Just stop making the things . that ' s not going_to happen , and even reducing emissions , alleviating traffic congestion and improving safety will result in higher car prices . The automobile has been called &quot; the machine that changed the world. &quot; Clearly it has . Many regard it with emotion , awed by the freedom , speed and opportunity it has brought their lives . Still , its reach is limited . Today only one in 12 of the world ' s people owns a car . As that figure increases , the auto will certainly bring more change -- for companies , consumers and countries . Troubled Global Landscape The auto changed Japan . Its auto industry was a juggernaut that made Toyota , Nissan , Honda , Mazda and Mitsubishi household names . For nearly 40 years , it was the classic growth_industry , some years increasing 10 % or more . No more . Japan ' s domestic auto industry has been in decline for three years , a reflection of the economic slump that has overtaken the country . &quot; The Japanese automotive economy is changing from a growth to a cyclical industry , &quot; said automotive consultant William Pochiluk . The shift caught some auto_makers unprepared . Nissan lost nearly $ 1 billion in 1993 and continues to bleed red ink . It became the first Japanese company ever to close a car factory when it shuttered the Zama plant last year . Japanese sales also fell_in the United States as the yen rose in value against the dollar , making their products pricier than U.S. models . They fared worse in Europe , where a severe recession drove industrywide sales down 16 % . The European slump exposed the weakness of car_makers there as well . Fiat of Italy suffered huge losses . Volkswagen , once revered for its engineering excellence , lost $ 1.3 billion last year and now is ridiculed for its inefficient plants . In the United States , the news is better . General Motors , Ford and Chrysler all reported strong operating earnings in 1993 . But the profits came_after three years of painful losses . GM alone lost $ 18 billion in North_America in the last four years as it closed plants and fired workers . With such economic and competitive pressures , a further shakeout is widely expected , with some weaker auto_makers likely to go_under . Perils and Partners It was once theorized that the auto industry would shrink to just three major players : GM , Toyota and Volkswagen . Only these companies -- the largest , most powerful car_makers in their regions -- could make the investments and achieve the economies of scale necessary to compete on a global basis , it was argued . Few ascribe to that view today . The reason : New technologies are more accessible , and new production methods require being lean and nimble . &quot; Size is absolutely no guarantor of success in the auto business , &quot; said Robert Lutz , president of Chrysler , the smallest U.S. car_maker . &quot; It ' s not going_to be the large that eat the small , but the swift that eat the slow. &quot; In January , the German luxury auto_maker BMW devoured Rover Group of Britain , acquiring a controlling 80 % share_in the weaker company for $ 1.2 billion . The remainder of Rover is owned by Honda . The BMW-Rover marriage is considered a good fit . BMW gets access to key products , such_as Rover ' s acclaimed sports utility vehicles , while the_British firm gets access to its partner ' s financial strength . But even mergers that make_sense are difficult to pull_off . The combination of Renault and Volvo fell_apart last year when Swedish investors rebelled , fearing the_French would control their national treasure . &quot; Acquisitions tend to have a lot of unknowns , &quot; said Maryann Keller , a New York auto analyst and author . &quot; Consolidations that look good on paper often don ' t work . The reason is people . Different cultures are hard to mesh. &quot; That was the case with the seven-year engagement of GM and South_Korea ' s Daewoo Group . GM bought 50 % of Daewoo Motors in 1985 . The idea was to build the Pontiac LeMans using GM ' s engineering and marketing and Korean labor . Initially hailed as a model for global manufacturing , the venture collapsed in 1992 amid heated recriminations involving divergent cultures , language difficulties and differing business goals . Such failures have prompted many companies to eschew equity mergers for strategic alliances . Among the world ' s 41 largest auto_makers there are 244 agreements , including joint_ventures in manufacturing , parts sharing and research , according to the authoritative Ward ' s Automotive International . Peugeot of France , for instance , has 22 agreements with other car_companies , including a partnership with Taiwan ' s Chinese Automobile Co . to build Citroen C15s and one with Fiat to produce a commercial van . Not everyone advocates alliances . Chrysler , which once owned 24 % of Mitsubishi , has sold its equity stake and unwound many of its joint operations with the Japanese car_maker . &quot; Alliances don ' t work , &quot; Robert Eaton , chairman and chief_executive of Chrysler , said flatly . The reason , he said , is that the market changes so rapidly while product development takes so_long . Thus what made an alliance attractive initially often vanishes by the time the vehicle is produced . For any partnership to succeed , it must benefit both sides . The Nissan Quest and Mercury Villager are produced by Ford at its Avon Lake , Ohio , plant . They ' re the same vehicle with different brand names . The venture helps both : Nissan gets a minivan without having to pay an import tariff , and Ford gets a small minivan to complement its larger Windstar . These close ties have allowed manufacturers to learn valuable lessons from each other . U.S. manufacturers have recovered in part because they have applied so-called lean production techniques copied from the Japanese . World Cars Another lesson is designing cars that can be sold on more_than one continent . The idea is not new . VW ' s Beetle is the archetypal people ' s car . It was tiny , cheap and well engineered . As an anti-status symbol in the 1960s , the roly-poly car became the first significant export to invade American shores . The Japanese also used their centralized design and assembly operations to produce so-called world cars -- vehicles sold on more_than one continent with only minor changes . An example : Toyota ' s Corolla . The latest attempt at a world car is Ford ' s Mondeo . The family sedan , which was launched last year in Europe , is being built_in Belgium , Mexico and the United States . Ford hopes to sell 750 # 000 a year in 59 countries . But Ford failed in an earlier attempt to build a global car . The Escort subcompact was envisioned for the world market in the 1980s . But internal rivalry between the European and U.S. staffs resulted in two cars with only two common parts -- an ashtray and an instrument_panel brace . This time around , the company says that 90 % of the European Mondeo is the same as the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique , the car ' s U.S. marques . But the program came at tremendous cost : $ 6 billion . Ford argues that the tab is reasonable . It is providing three cars in five body styles with two new engines that will be used in future products . Most important , the project has integrated Ford ' s parts buying , manufacturing , design and engineering on a global basis . In fact , Ford is regarded by many industry experts as a model global car_company . The firm is slowly melding its once autonomous international operations using supercomputers and video teleconferences . It has developed a web of global alliances : Mazda in Japan ; Kia in South_Korea ; VW in Portugal , Brazil and Argentina , and BMW in Malaysia . &quot; We ' ve been evolving into the next level of multinational company , &quot; said Alex Trotman , Ford chairman and chief_executive . &quot; We ' ve been managing more on a global basis. &quot; Where the Action Is For Ford and other major auto_makers , that means seeking opportunities in new markets . Simple math shows why . There is a car for every two people in the United States and Germany , and one for every three in Japan . In contrast , China has an auto for every 652 individuals ; India , for every 356 ; Indonesia , 136 ; Egypt , 109 ; Colombia , 42 ; Turkey , 31 ; Russia and other former states of the Soviet_Union , 17 , and Mexico , 12 . Fueled by a high-octane mix of rising incomes and free-market policies , many of these emerging countries want to become significant car and truck producers . Eventually , some hope to become major exporters . The effort is likely to produce a jobs bonanza . For every auto assembly job created , there could be up_to 10 more jobs generated in parts manufacturing , distribution , sales and service . But major manufacturers are treading carefully . After all , auto production is not as easy as selling a formula for Coke or building a McDonald ' s on a busy street_corner . &quot; We can ' t move_in and sneeze without spending $ 1 billion in some of these places , &quot; said W . Wayne Booker , executive_vice_president of Ford ' s international automotive operations . In addition , the maze of trade regulations and local restrictions can be dizzying . Maintaining quality_control in distant plants is difficult . The threat of labor unrest and even war is often real . And building vehicles to suit local taste is challenging . Still , the possibility of 10 % to 15 % annual growth_rates is irresistible , and car_makers are maneuvering on many fronts to get a foot in the door . Here is where the action is hottest : * Southeast_Asia : Spurred by a rising , affluent middle_class , the region -- including Thailand , Indonesia , Singapore , Malaysia , Taiwan and Vietnam -- is rapidly replacing traditional transport with cars . Tom McDaniel , president of GM ' s Asia-Pacific operations , based in Singapore , sees a near doubling of sales from 860 # 000 in 1993 to 1.4 million by 2000 . &quot; The market is exploding , &quot; he said . Thailand , where sales increased more_than 25 % last year , is the biggest and hottest market . Malaysia is building vehicles in two ventures with Japanese partners . In less than a decade , production has topped 100 # 000 units a year . Vietnam , boosted by the end of the U.S. trade_embargo , has licensed half_a_dozen companies to build cars , trucks and buses . Taiwan , which is a bigger market that Australia , continues to be strong , with annual sales exceeding 400 # 000 vehicles . Exports are slowly increasing . The Japanese dominate the region , accounting_for 90 % of all sales . * China : With a population of 1.2 billion , this is the market most lusted_after . Sales are projected to soar from 1.2 million in 1993 to 3 million by 2000 . &quot; China stands_out as the major opportunity for growth in the next 10 years , &quot; said David Herman , chairman of Adam-Opel , GM ' s German subsidiary . Turning a nation of bicycle , bus and oxcart riders into car drivers will not be easy . The country ' s roads are primitive . Economic and political uncertainties abound . The potential rewards are so big , however , that no one wants to be left_out . Volkswagen , Peugeot , Chrysler and GM already are making vehicles there in joint_ventures . * India : There has been an auto industry in India for 50 years , but high duties on cars and tight government control of investment and expansion have hindered development . Recent actions to lift these obstacles have raised hope that India is ready to build a competitive industry to serve its population of 820 million . Suzuki is investing $ 200 million to build a second plant for its Indian joint_venture . Mercedes-Benz and GM are both negotiating entry . * South_America : With the debt crisis behind it , this region is no longer the market of the future . Auto sales and production are booming , thanks to widespread trade liberalization . Production in Brazil jumped 30 % in 1993 , and sales soared 43 % . Brazil recently reduced taxes 20 % on small cars . The decision prompted VW to resume production of the Beetle in Brazil after a seven-year hiatus . The region ' s major manufacturers -- VW , Fiat , Ford and GM -- are increasing spending in the region and seeking export opportunities . Economic concerns persist , however . Inflation is so severe in Brazil -- a 2 # 500 % annual rate last year -- that in January GM instituted daily price hikes on vehicles . * Mexico : Although auto sales and production were down in 1993 , the slump was overshadowed by the approval of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . The International Trade Commission projects that NAFTA will mean a 7 % increase in jobs and a 16 % increase in wages for Mexico . With its central location , it is likely to become a major staging ground for exports to both North and South_America . VW , Mercedes-Benz and Nissan all have plants there . * Russia and Eastern Europe : Auto_makers are proceeding here with caution because of the unstable economic and political situation . GM and Suzuki are in Hungary . Fiat is working in Poland . VW acquired Skoda in Czechoslovakia . Russia privatized its largest auto_maker , Volga Auto Works , two years ago . GM is providing the company with $ 700 million in engine-control systems over the next five years . Trade_Winds The growth of emerging markets has accelerated as trade_barriers have come_down worldwide . Despite nagging problems , global trade_in general is freer today than ever before . &quot; Tariffs are coming_down in a lot of places , &quot; said Dick Nerod , GM ' s vice_president of South_American operations . &quot; It results in more competition and more choices for consumers. &quot; In Colombia , for instance , vehicle sales are booming because of a surge of_imports made_possible by a 25 % reduction in import_duties . Many of the vehicles are coming from Venezuela and other South_American_countries . The Assn . of Southeast Asian_Nations -- Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand , Indonesia , the Philippines and Brunei -- has adopted a tariff-reduction system to spur trade and increase market access . ASEAN supports tariff reductions of 20 % by 2000 on most goods , including cars with more_than 50 % local content . Plenty of restrictions remain . Certification requirements , foreign ownership restrictions and high local-content rules are common . India , seeking to protect its supplier industry , imposes a 70 % local-content requirement . Trade frictions continue to flare among the major auto-producing nations . This is likely to persist as long as there are significant disparities in their balance of payments and the efficiencies of their operations . Europe has imposed import restrictions on Japan until 2000 to buy_time to restructure its inefficient auto industry . The United States continues to press Japan to open its market and lower its trade_deficit . The main issue in these battles is jobs . The U.S. Commerce_Department says every $ 1 billion of trade imbalance equals a loss of 20 # 000 jobs . With a little over half of the nearly $ 60-billion U.S. trade_deficit with Japan tied to autos and auto parts , that means 600 # 000 jobs . Many major auto_makers are undertaking global expansion in efforts to alleviate trade tensions and shield themselves from currency fluctuations . The Japanese have concentrated design , engineering and manufacturing at_home . But as trade tensions and the yen have risen , they have adopted a localization strategy -- moving production to where the vehicles will be sold . Greening of the Auto Almost as rancorous as trade arguments is the growing debate over environmental damage caused by the automobile . Is the dream machine that promised mobility becoming a global nightmare causing oil-consuming gridlock , land-scarring sprawl and environmental degradation ? &quot; Environmental damage from driving plagues the farthest reaches of the globe -- polluting the air in cities , squandering valuable land and even altering the earth ' s climate , &quot; wrote Marcia D . Lowe of the Worldwatch Institute . In the developed world , growth in the number of autos is slowing but miles traveled is increasing . In emerging nations , the demand and desire for cars_race forward despite inadequate infrastructure and pollution controls . Signs of society ' s inability to cope_with the auto abound : Traffic tie-ups in Amsterdam ' s narrow downtown streets were so bad that it declared its central_city a car-free zone . So_much lead is dumped into the air in Bangkok in the exhaust from cars , trucks and the ubiquitous motorbikes and tuk-tuks -- three-wheeled vehicles -- that babies are routinely born with high trace levels . Excessive exposure to lead can cause neurological damage . A recent report funded by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and written by Elmer Johnson , a lawyer and former executive_vice_president of GM , calls_for greater government reliance on pricing strategies -- higher fuel taxes , parking fees and highway tolls -- to curb vehicle usage . The study also urges development of computerized smart highway_systems to ease congestion ; production of electric vehicles to reduce emissions ; greater recycling of auto components , and development of mass transit . Strides are being made to make the auto greener , even in developing countries . Mexico now requires catalytic_converters on its vehicles . Brazil encourages small , fuel-efficient vehicles through its tax_policies . Singapore controls traffic with an expensive licensing system limiting driving time . Germany is in the forefront of auto recycling , a response to the country ' s shrinking landfill capacity and to the strength of its Greens movement . Electric vehicle research is under way throughout the world . The effort is being propelled by California , which has mandated that 2 % of vehicles sold there in 1998 be zero-emission models . Prototypes are being tested throughout the world , even as auto_makers argue that battery technology is lagging . There is a global trend toward increased cooperation among government , industry and the environmental community . The U.S._government has formed a historic partnership with the Big Three to develop a &quot; clean car &quot; that can get_up to 80 miles per gallon . &quot; There is a lessening of environmental ' wackoism , ' &quot; said David Cole , executive_director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan . &quot; It is being replaced by government and industry working together as a team. &quot;</TEXT>
