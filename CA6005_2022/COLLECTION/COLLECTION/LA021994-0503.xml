   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : RAIN EXPECTED TO TAPER OFF THIS WEEKEND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Showers were expected to taper_off this weekend and give_way to sunny skies by Monday as the Alaskan storm that dropped from one to three inches of rain on Ventura County moves eastward , forecasters said . A 20 % chance of showers remains today , with dark and cloudy skies throughout the day . &quot; We still have some lingering rain_showers , &quot; said David Gomberg , a meteorologist for the National Weather Service . &quot; But it looks_like we will be back to more of the usual -- warm and dry -- through most of next week , &quot; he said . The storm brought_up to 1.5 inches to the coast and inland valleys , and left two to three inches in the mountain areas , Gomberg said . Snow levels dropped to 3 # 500 feet . Mt . Pinos , which stands at 8 # 900 feet , was dusted with six inches of snow , said Tracie Welton , a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman . A break_in the threatening skies could trigger an influx of people heading to the mountains above Ojai over the Presidents ' Day weekend , she said . &quot; We could get_up to 10 # 000 to 20 # 000 cars a day , &quot; Welton said . &quot; The weekend brings a lot of cross-country skiers and people who like to play in the snow. &quot; Welton warned visitors to drive cautiously and carry chains . The rain caused several minor accidents around the county , California Highway Patrol officials said . But it also helped efforts to clean_up an oil spill caused when a pipeline ruptured during last month ' s earthquake . Crews have been working since then to clean_up an estimated 147 # 000 gallons of crude_oil that poured into the Santa Clara River from a ruptured Atlantic Richfield pipeline in Valencia . &quot; The water helped a bit because it flushed out remaining oil trapped in sediments and vegetation , &quot; said Bob Schlichting , California Department of Fish and Game spokesman . Schlichting said the remaining oil is difficult to remove . &quot; We ' ve seen a light sheen of oil on the river now ; unfortunately it ' s not thick enough for us to recover , &quot; he said . The remaining oil has also mixed with dirt and vegetation , he said . &quot; There ' s still oil out there that birds and animals can get into. &quot; County Rainfall Here are rainfall figures from the Ventura County Flood_Control District for the 24-hour period ending 7 p.m. Friday .
