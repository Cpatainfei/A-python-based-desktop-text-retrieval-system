   <TEXT> With boneless chicken thighs now available in many markets , try substituting them in recipes that are usually made with chicken_breasts . Though thighs take a little longer to cook , you ' ll be impressed with the results . Thighs are tender , succulent dark_meat . Unlike breasts , they do not dry_out quickly in the pan . If you happen to overcook them or keep them warm longer than you had planned , you ' ll notice that they remain moist and their texture does not turn cottony . For the same reason , dishes made with this cut reheat well . Another good thing , they cost much less than breasts . * They ' re versatile -- you can grill , stir-fry or saute them , or use them in stews and casseroles . Cut boneless thighs into cubes or strips and cook them gently in tomato , curry or peanut sauces . Or create new dishes by replacing beef in stews with chicken thighs to make lighter , fast-cooking dishes . Boneless chicken needs only 10 to 15 minutes of braising , compared with the 45 minutes required for chicken pieces with bones . * To make satisfying pasta suppers , mix any of these speedy chicken_stews or sautes with linguine , fettuccine , vermicelli or Chinese rice noodles . Other good accompaniments are brown or white_rice , couscous , steamed potatoes , or baked or microwaved yams . While the chicken is cooking , toss packaged lettuce or shredded cabbage or carrots with a little oil and vinegar to make a quick salad , and you ' ll have a tasty , hearty meal with a minimum of time and effort . * A friend of mine from Taipei taught me to make this light , easy , meal-in-one dish of chicken and vegetables seasoned with curry_powder and soy_sauce . A cross between a stir-fry and a quick braise , it would typically be served at_home when a fast dinner is needed . For best flavor , use imported curry_powder .

Peel potatoes and cut_into 1 / 2-inch cubes . Cut chicken into cubes of about 1x1 / 2x1 / 2 inches . Heat oil in wok , medium saute pan or deep skillet over medium-high heat . Add onion and stir-fry until fragrant , about 2 minutes . Add chicken and stir-fry 1 1 / 2 minutes . Stir in curry_powder . Add water , soy_sauce , carrots and potatoes . Simmer , covered , 10 minutes . Uncover and simmer until chicken and vegetables are tender , 5 to 10 minutes longer . Adjust seasonings to taste . Serve with hot cooked rice . Makes 3 to 4 servings . * For this quick dish , sauteed chicken and peppers are flavored with garlic , hot_peppers and green_onions , then tossed with tri-colored noodles . Use the three kinds of peppers to make the dish colorful . PASTA-PEPPER MEDLEY WITH CHICKEN 1 pound boneless and skinless chicken thighs 3 sweet_peppers , preferably 1 green , 1 red and 1 yellow 3 green_onions 1 to 2 jalapeno chiles , seeded and ribs removed 4 medium cloves garlic 1 / 4 cup olive_oil Salt Freshly ground pepper 1 / 2 pound tri-colored noodles 1 teaspoon dried leaf thyme , crumbled Trim chicken of fat .

Quarter white and light-green parts of green_onions lengthwise , then cut_into 1 1 / 2-inch lengths . Chop jalapenos and garlic in food_processor .
