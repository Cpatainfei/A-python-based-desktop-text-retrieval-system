   <HEADLINE> ART AND ETHNIC HATRED ; ANTI-SEMITISM IS FAR FROM DEAD IN FORMERLY COMMUNIST EUROPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last Monday , Germany formally returned seven major French artworks to France . The seven -- including two important paintings by Claude Monet , &quot; The Louveciennes Road &quot; and &quot; Snow at Sunset &quot; -- were among 28 works confiscated from French Jews by the Nazis and held_in more recent years by the communist regime in East Germany.All 28 works are now to be returned . The ceremonial transfer of the first seven by Germany ' s Chancellor Helmut Kohl to France ' s President Francois Mitterrand opened a two-day conference on a variety of political and economic subjects . The transfer made little news in the United States , but it may be read as yet another reminder that communism did not just keep the lid on the caldron of ethnic hatreds in Eastern Europe ; in many ways it actively kept that pot boiling . Internationalist in its founding years , communism in power covered over its failings by appealing_to majority chauvinism against ethnic minorities . The Russification of national minorities in the Soviet_Union is the best-known example of this , but there were others : Communist Romania , for example , was brutal with its Hungarian minority . And virtually everywhere in the Eastern Bloc anti-Semitism was not just tolerated but fostered . Bolshevism-come-to-power appealed_to supposed peasant authenticity against capitalism as Jewish and as &quot; cosmopolitan &quot; just as pre-World War II fascism had pitted peasants against allegedly Jewish , &quot; cosmopolitan &quot; Bolshevism . Western Europe ' s postwar recovery from prewar anti-Semitism , such_as it has been , has not been matched in Eastern Europe . Reunited Germany ' s return of East_Germany ' s loot to the_French is a clear and honorable step_in the right direction , but it is also a reminder of how long a journey remains to be made .</TEXT>
