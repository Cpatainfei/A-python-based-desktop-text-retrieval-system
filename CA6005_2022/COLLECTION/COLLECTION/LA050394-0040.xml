   <HEADLINE> ONCOLOGIST FACES ETHICS QUESTIONS OVER RELEASE OF FILES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Westside oncologist , already under scrutiny from the National Cancer Institute for discrepancies in data he submitted to a major national breast_cancer study , is now the target of criticism for an alleged breach of medical ethics -- releasing confidential patient files to a Chicago newspaper reporter . A top NCI official said Monday that Dr. David Plotkin released the records without the permission of his patients . The agency has notified the federal_Office for Protection From Research Risks -- which monitors scientific_research and has disciplinary powers -- and an internal review board at Brotman Medical_Center in Culver City , where Plotkin practices . &quot; A patient ' s medical_record is confidential and I think it ' s very important that any of us , when we go_to a physician , know that information about our health is not made public , &quot; said Dr. Bruce Chabner , director of the division of cancer treatment at the NCI . &quot; I think this was not ethical. &quot; A spokesman for Plotkin said the doctor had released the files on the condition that the reporter would not make the names of patients public -- and he did not . &quot; He sought and received a guarantee that no patient confidentiality would be breached , &quot; said spokesman Larry Weinberg . Nonetheless , experts in medical ethics say Plotkin acted improperly . &quot; You should not do_it , &quot; said Art Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania . &quot; It is a given that a researcher ' s obligation first and foremost is to protect patient privacy . Information should not be revealed , ever , without explicit subject consent or court order. &quot; The latest development involving Plotkin comes amid a wide-ranging probe into data discrepancies -- and , in one case , outright fraud -- in research conducted by the nation ' s oldest and largest breast_cancer study group , the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project . The project is responsible_for some of the most important breast_cancer research in the country , including a landmark 1985 study that found that lumpectomy -- in which only the cancerous tumor is removed -- is as effective as mastectomy , in which the entire breast is removed . But the group has been tarnished in recent months by revelations that a Canadian researcher , Dr. Roger Poisson , had falsified data so that women who were ineligible for the lumpectomy study could be included . The NCI says the fraud did not change the study ' s outcome . The disclosures prompted the NCI to force the head of the project , noted breast_cancer researcher Bernard Fisher of the University of Pittsburgh , to resign . They have also spurred audits of participating institutions in New York and Louisiana , as well as the Memorial Cancer Research Foundation of Southern California , a one-doctor center run_by Plotkin . The NCI has found no evidence that Plotkin committed fraud , although it has found deficiencies in his files , including one case in which a woman who died after open-heart_surgery was reported as being alive . Results of the NCI review are likely to be made public later this week , Chabner said . Meanwhile , the chief_executive_officer of Brotman Medical_Center , a private 495-bed hospital with which Plotkin is affiliated , said the hospital is taking_control of Plotkin ' s files at the NCI ' s request . Plotkin contacted the NCI last week to request the review . He told officials that a reporter for the Chicago Tribune , John Crewdson , had presented him with an internal audit conducted by the NSABP in 1990 that showed serious discrepancies in his data . He said he had not known of the 1990 audit but allowed Crewdson to look_at his files because he believed he had nothing to hide . Weinberg , Plotkin ' s spokesman , said the doctor feared that his reputation would be damaged if he did not permit Crewdson to examine his work . &quot; He was scared , &quot; Weinberg said . &quot; It was an error. &quot; Crewdson , meanwhile , was also criticized by the NCI ' s Chabner for examining the records . However , Dick Ciccone , managing editor of the Chicago Tribune , said that because the records consisted solely of NSABP enrollment data -- as opposed to patient histories and disease prognoses -- the paper does not believe there was a breach of confidentiality . But he acknowledged that the files included patient names as well as specific information , such_as a patient ' s tumor size , that help doctors determine whether women are eligible to participate in NSABP studies . &quot; This was not , in the classic sense , a violation , &quot; Ciccone said . What , if any , action might be taken against Plotkin for the alleged breach is unclear . The Office for Protection From Research Risks has the power to discipline researchers by barring them from receiving federal funding . But Plotkin has not participated in the NSABP since 1988 . In an interview with The Times shortly after Fisher was forced to step_down , Plotkin defended Fisher , saying it was impossible for the head of the NSABP to know what each researcher had done . At the same time , Plotkin said he had &quot; markedly decreased &quot; his own involvement in the NSABP because he did not like the direction the project was taking . In particular , he objected to a current -- and highly controversial -- clinical trial in which the NSABP is testing to see whether the drug tamoxifen can be used to prevent breast_cancer . He said he felt tamoxifen would not be effective and complained that the trial was initiated &quot; because of pressure from feminist groups to do more studies on women. &quot; And he said that , in participating in earlier NSABP research , including the lumpectomy study , he felt that he became &quot; a tool of the feminists of Los Angeles in bringing_about less radical surgery for breast cancer. &quot; Through his spokesman , Plotkin has declined interviews about the NCI audit .</TEXT>
