   <HEADLINE> WARMTH IN WINTER : LONG-SIMMERED BEANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When I want inspiration for winter meals that will satisfy me down to my frozen fingertips , I turn_to Italy ' s bean dishes . These are simple , economical recipes , usually combining beans with a little olive_oil , herbs and perhaps meat . They are also magical recipes that fill the kitchen with an earthy , sweet aroma that makes coming_home a reward . Look in any Italian cookbook for inspiration . There ' s the dish that &quot; brings_back memories of cold winter nights when simple food brought my family closer together , &quot; a delicious mixture of beans and sausage simmered in tomato_sauce that Biba Caggiano describes in her cookbook , &quot; Northern Italian Cooking &quot; ( Price Stern Sloan : 1981 ) . Who could not develop an appetite for Sienese-style bean soup that Giuliano Bugialli , an Italian cookbook author and teacher , sketches ? It ' s a combination of cannellini beans , red_onions , garlic , basil , tomatoes , cabbage , pancetta and thyme . &quot; It reaches its rustic peak in Tuscany where it ' s served with raw red_onion , &quot; writes Bugialli in &quot; Classic Techniques of Italian Cooking &quot; ( Simon &amp; Schuster : 1982 ) . Or how about the soup from the Modena mountains in Italy that Lynne Rossetto Kasper discovered when researching &quot; The Splendid Table &quot; ( William Morrow : 1992 ) ? The recipe ' s blend of at least seven vegetables and pinto_beans is enough to banish the deepest chills . Fortunately these dishes are relatively easy to make . And , although there ' s romance and no small degree of practicality to making a huge potful , they can also be prepared in small amounts . * This sausage , mushroom and bean ragout merges several recipes into a savory adaptation of Italy ' s bean classics . SAUSAGE , MUSHROOM AND BEAN RAGOUT 1 cup dried cannellini beans 1 tablespoon olive_oil 1 / 2 pound coarsely chopped mushrooms ( oyster , shiitake , Portobello or any flavorful mushroom ) 1 / 2 pound salami or kielbasa or other dry sausage , sliced 1 / 4 inch thick 1 clove garlic_clove , minced 1 small onion , diced 1 1 / 2 cups chicken_broth 1 teaspoon minced fresh sage Salt , pepper Soak beans overnight in water to cover by 2 inches . Drain and rinse . Heat oil in large skillet . Add mushrooms and saute 5 minutes . Remove and set_aside . Add salami , garlic and onion to skillet . Cook over medium-high heat until meat is browned , about 5 minutes . Add drained beans , chicken_broth and sage . Bring to boil . Reduce heat to low . Cover and simmer until beans are tender and mixture is thick and soupy , 45 to 60 minutes . Add mushrooms to mixture . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Mixture should have stew consistency . If there is too_much liquid , remove cover and simmer 5 minutes longer . Don ' t season ragout before reducing liquid . Makes 2 generous servings . Note : If desired , use 1 ( 15-ounce ) can cannellini beans . Rinse under cold water to remove starchy liquid . Drain . Simmer , uncovered , with chicken_broth and sage until mixture is heated through and thickened , about 15 minutes instead of 45 minutes .</TEXT>
