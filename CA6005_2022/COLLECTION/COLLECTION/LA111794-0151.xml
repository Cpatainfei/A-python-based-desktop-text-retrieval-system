   <HEADLINE> GOVERNMENT ' S 4-YEAR BIAS LAWSUIT AGAINST EL MONTE ENDS ; JOBS : U.S. HAD ORIGINALLY ALLEGED 64 VICTIMS . JUDGE RULES THAT TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE VICTIMS OF DISCRIMINATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The federal_government ' s four-year discrimination lawsuit against El Monte ended last week after a federal_court judge ruled that two individuals had been discriminated against . * The federal_Department of Justice had alleged that the city denied blacks and Asian Americans entry-level jobs as police_officers and firefighters . The two individuals , who were the only ones left in the suit after a long wrangle between the city and Justice_Department , will receive $ 20 # 000 in compensation each , for a total city payout of $ 40 # 000 . That reduced number contrasts dramatically with the 64 possible victims originally brought_forward by the federal_Department of Justice , the $ 330 # 000 the city was required to set_aside for all those victims and the $ 550 # 000 the city ultimately spent on legal_fees fighting the federal case . &quot; We feel_like it was kind of a witch hunt , &quot; said El Monte Mayor Patricia Wallach . &quot; It ' s just ludicrous that the Department_of_Justice came_in with a case this thin. &quot; Wallach ' s complaints were echoed by lawyers representing three other cities , Alhambra and Pomona in the San Gabriel Valley and Torrance in the South Bay . All three cities have been accused of discrimination in hiring police_officer and firefighters and were likewise sued by the Justice_Department . Justice_Department officials say they prosecuted the cities only after receiving discrimination complaints against them and after investigating to find sufficient legal grounds to file the lawsuits . The department began legal_action against El Monte in 1990 . According to federal_officials , the city ' s 107-member police_force had only one black member and its 66-member fire_department only one Asian American firefighter . Federal_officials argued that the low numbers were the result of discriminatory hiring policies from 1985 to 1990 . * In 1992 , the city agreed to set_aside $ 330 # 000 in compensation for alleged victims . The Justice_Department put ads in local newspapers asking people who thought they were victims of discrimination to come_forward . After sifting through 64 claims , the city agreed to pay 14 individuals , said Mary Dollarhide , the attorney who represented El Monte . But when the city discovered that the first_person on the list was a white male and the second_person had a criminal_record that would have disqualified him for a job as a police_officer , El Monte officials decided to contest the payment , she said . Six other alleged victims were disqualified for compensation be cause they would have been too old at the time of application to have been hired as police or fire cadets , Dollarhide said . Others were eliminated for other , similar kinds of reasons that the Department_of_Justice could have easily checked , she said . &quot; They were coming out and doing what I perceive to be sloppy work , &quot; Dollarhide said . &quot; If we hadn ' t challenged them , we would have forked out money to Mr. White Guy. &quot; The city believes that the final two candidates also do not qualify . One lacks the educational background claimed on her application and another failed a number of qualifying tests for other police_departments , Dollarhide said . But after Los Angeles U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real ruled against the city on Nov . 7 , the City_Council decided to end the costly legal battle and pay the remaining two , Dollarhide said . &quot; It ' s very frustrating from the city ' s point_of_view , &quot; Wallach said . She added that city officials kept battling the federal_government instead of simply paying the money because city officials did not believe the city was guilty of discrimination . City officials still deny that they discriminated against anyone . According to statistics in a recent ACLU study of police and fire_departments , El Monte now has three blacks and four Asian Americans on its 126-member police_force . Among the city ' s 57 firefighters , one is black and one is Asian American . But city officials say the low numbers do not reflect patterns of discrimination , but simply the difficulty of attracting minority candidates to work in small cities where pay is usually lower than in larger urban agencies . Attorneys for the three other cities sued by the Justice_Department are also crying foul . The number of victims will ultimately amount to a_few handfuls and not the scores initially claimed by the government , the attorneys contend . &quot; It ' s a sellers ' market for minority public safety workers , &quot; said Drew Bridges , Alhambra ' s attorney . Alhambra recently lost to the city of San Jose its black police_chief , Raymond Brooks , who was hired by Alhambra after a nationwide recruitment , Bridges said . * The federal_government claimed that nearly 100 individuals were discriminated against in Alhambra . But by checking each claim , many applicants were eliminated and the final number might actually be closer to 10 , Bridges said . &quot; The numbers are ludicrous , &quot; agreed Torrance City Atty . John Fellows , whose city is sifting through 76 claims . &quot; It ' s the closest thing to extortion that you can imagine. &quot; The city of Pomona , which was accused of discriminating against black police_officers , may reach a resolution with the federal_government by the end of the year , said Pomona City Atty . Arnold Alvarez-Glasman . The city , which set_aside $ 160 # 000 for compensation and $ 40 # 000 for a recruitment program , has nearly finished sifting through the claims of 44 people , Alvarez-Glasman said .
