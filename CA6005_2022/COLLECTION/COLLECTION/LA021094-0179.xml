   <HEADLINE> PROTESTERS DEMAND FREEDOM FOR GANG-TRUCE ACTIVIST ; COURTS : THEY SAY SEVERITY OF DRUG-RELATED CHARGES AGAINST ART L . ROMA STEMS FROM HIS LEADERSHIP ON STREETS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About a dozen protesters marched outside the federal courthouse Wednesday demanding the freedom of former street gang leader Art L . Roma , who is_on trial on narcotics and money_laundering charges . Roma , 31 , is noted for his efforts to forge a truce among Orange County ' s gangs . He was arrested by federal drug agents in September , 1992 , at the close of a major investigation of an international money_laundering operation . But the protesters who gathered_in front of the U.S. District Court building Wednesday said Roma played a minor_role in the sprawling case , acting only as a one-time courier delivering a package he did not know contained $ 60 # 000 . They waved placards reading &quot; Free Art &quot; and &quot; Stop the Drive-bys. &quot; The demonstrators said they believe the severity of the charges against Roma stems from his activism on the streets . &quot; He knows he made a mistake and he ' s willing to pay_for his crime , but these charges are ridiculous , &quot; said Leticia Rivera , Romo ' s companion . &quot; It ' s political . They see him as a threat because of his influence. &quot; The prosecutor , Thomas P . Sleisenger , declined to comment about the ongoing trial , which began Nov . 9 and may finish by the end of the month . Romo is_on trial with six other co-defendants . All were arrested during &quot; Operation Green Ice , &quot; an undercover operation involving police in six countries . Rivera said attorneys have told her that Roma could face more_than 15 years in prison if he is convicted of the three felony charges he faces . Roma was among five former gang leaders who founded the United Gangs Council in 1992 and authored a shaky , but often praised , peace_treaty among the county ' s gangs . &quot; The shootings , the drive-bys , they decreased after the truce was forged , &quot; Mike Roma , the defendant ' s brother , said Wednesday . &quot; No one can deny that . When that happened all_the politicians wanted to know Art , but now they turn their back on him. &quot;</TEXT>
