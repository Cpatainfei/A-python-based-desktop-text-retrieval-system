   <HEADLINE> CLINTON LIFTS VIETNAM EMBARGO TO ' RESOLVE THE FATE ' OF MIAS ; TRADE : PRESIDENT SAYS ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS DID NOT AFFECT DECISION TO END 19-YEAR BAN . HE WARNS THAT SANCTIONS MAY BE REIMPOSED IF HANOI DOES NOT CONTINUE COOPERATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taking a historic step to close the wounds of a divisive war , President Clinton on Thursday ordered an immediate end to the 19-year trade_embargo against Vietnam . Setting_aside any economic rationale , Clinton asserted that he made the move entirely as a means of resolving remaining questions about the fate of missing U.S. soldiers . &quot; I am absolutely convinced it offers us the best way to resolve the fate of those who remain and about whom we are not sure , &quot; he said at a White_House ceremony . &quot; I have said that any decisions about our relationship with Vietnam should be guided by one factor and one factor alone : gaining the fullest possible accounting_for our prisoners_of_war and our missing in action. &quot; Vietnam ' s help in answering these questions has recently produced &quot; substantial progress &quot; in accounting_for missing soldiers , he said , adding that &quot; we would lose leverage if there were no forward movement &quot; in relations between the two countries . And if the Vietnamese slow their efforts regarding the missing , the embargo may be reimposed , Clinton said . The step , still short of normalizing relations , culminates years of anguished public deliberation over a conflict that has continued to sow bitterness and division nearly two decades after its conclusion . Although many Vietnam veterans had pushed for a lifting of the embargo , major veterans groups were quick to condemn the move by a commander_in_chief who avoided military_service . &quot; We think that the advice given to the President was wrong , and we told him that , &quot; said John Sommer , director of the Washington office of the American_Legion , after meeting with the President and other veterans leaders at the White_House . The Veterans of Foreign Wars , Vietnam Veterans of America and Disabled Veterans of America , also represented at the meeting with Clinton , opposed the embargo ' s end as well . But despite the protests of veterans and groups representing families of missing soldiers , the broader public mood may have been suggested last week , when the Senate voted 62 to 38 to urge the President to lift the ban . Other lawmakers , including some Vietnam veterans , signaled their support Thursday for Clinton ' s action . &quot; This was the right decision , &quot; said Sen . John Kerry ( D-Mass. ) , a highly decorated Vietnam veteran who headed a yearlong Senate investigation into the POW-MIA issue . &quot; The President can be proud_of the fact ( that ) he took the extra year to make_sure we got more ( information ) from Vietnam . And we got more. &quot; Also hailing the decision were Gen . William C . Westmoreland , who commanded U.S. forces in Vietnam , and Gen . John W . Vessey , a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff and an emissary to Hanoi on the issue . * The end of the ban is expected to produce a quick boost for some U.S. companies and , by one estimate , may generate an added $ 9 billion in trade this year alone . U.S. officials will open a &quot; liaison office &quot; in Hanoi to oversee American interests . The action also creates the possibility that the United States , which has lost military bases in the Philippines , may be able to forge an important strategic alliance in Southeast_Asia to offset the influence of China , one of the world ' s few remaining Communist nations . Clinton declared last July that he would maintain the embargo until Vietnam proved its willingness to help provide a full accounting of missing servicemen . In citing progress on that front , Clinton pointed to four factors : * Since last July , the remains of 39 American servicemen have been recovered . * The number of inadequately explained &quot; discrepancy cases &quot; has fallen from 135 to 73 . * Vietnam and Laos have stepped_up their cooperation in searches for remains along their common border . * The Vietnamese have released important documents from their archives , including from antiaircraft units along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and from a &quot; military political_unit , &quot; officials said . U.S. officials said that they have other incentives , short of a resumption of the embargo , to ensure continued Vietnamese cooperation . The nation still wants full diplomatic relations with the United States , entry into international financial_institutions in which the United States is especially influential and assistance from U.S. programs that promote trade . Clinton said that his Administration has 500 people working_on the search for Americans missing in Southeast_Asia -- &quot; more_than any other Administration. &quot; He denied that his own lack of service in the military played any role in his decision . Indeed , although Clinton marched against the war as a student , he indicated that he had special feelings for the 58 # 000 Americans who died in Vietnam . Asked about his own history , he said : &quot; Everyone my age , whether they were in Vietnam or not , knew someone who died there . . . . And I think people in our generation are more insistent on trying to get a full accounting , more obsessed with it. &quot; Clinton said that all his senior military and diplomatic advisers and all his Cabinet members involved in the issue had urged that the embargo be lifted . Economic motives were so far removed , he said , that the Administration did not even conduct a study of the trade consequences of the action . It was perhaps a measure of the war ' s lingering bitterness that a number of the President ' s critics made_a_point of stressing his avoidance of the draft . &quot; Bill_Clinton refused to serve in Vietnam , protested the war and has no military experience . Yet he thinks he understands Vietnam better than the families who have endured years of uncertainty , national veterans organizations . . . and the majority of former POWs who sacrificed years of their lives in captivity , &quot; said Sen . Robert C . Smith ( R-N.H. ) , a Vietnam veteran who led the unsuccessful opposition to last week ' s Senate resolution on the embargo . Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) also denounced the move , calling it &quot; the wrong decision at the wrong time for the wrong reasons. &quot; * While representatives from four veterans organizations attended the White_House meeting with Clinton , the nation ' s largest POW-MIA family group , the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast_Asia , was so angry that its representative , Ann Mills Griffiths , boycotted the session . The President has &quot; clearly broken &quot; his promises on the conditions for lifting the embargo , she said . &quot; He ( Clinton ) didn ' t have the guts to fight in Vietnam , and now he ' s shown that he won ' t fight to bring our POWs home from Vietnam , &quot; said Dolores Alfond , the sister of a missing serviceman and president of the Seattle-based National Alliance of Families . &quot; President Clinton has sold_out the morality of the American people for a_few pieces of silver. &quot; &quot; He lied , &quot; said J . Thomas Burch Jr. , chairman of the National Vietnam Veterans Coalition , a federation of 75 veterans and POW-MIA family groups . &quot; All of the campaign promises he made to us about not lifting the embargo until there was a full accounting were just campaign rhetoric . He has betrayed our country and abandoned our men , and Vietnam veterans will do all that we can to assure that America elects a different President in 1996. &quot; The family and veterans groups also took_issue with Clinton ' s contention that significant progress already has been made in accounting_for the missing . Richard Childress , a former Ronald Reagan_Administration official who oversaw the POW-MIA issue as director of Asian affairs on the National Security_Council from 1981 to 1989 , said that the Administration &quot; worked very hard to create an aura of real cooperation &quot; on the POW issue . But he said most of Hanoi ' s cooperation to date has been cosmetic . * &quot; Yes , they ' ve been turning_over documents , but what ( the Vietnamese ) are giving us are summary documents . The originals are still there , &quot; Childress said . U.S. officials will need some weeks to write regulations to govern trade relations between the countries . But the business_community was quick to predict broad and immediate effects from the easing . &quot; Everything you can think_of , they need , &quot; said Eric Rehmann , managing director for the Vietnam America Trade &amp; Investment Consulting Co . in Washington . Vietnam is hoping to rebuild roads , bridges , telecommunications_systems , ports , airports and hospitals . Because the George_Bush Administration decided to permit limited business contacts , such U.S. firms as Bank of America , IBM , Caterpillar , DuPont , Motorola and Phillip Morris already are licensed to do business there . Hours after Clinton ' s announcement , American Express and United Airlines announced plans to begin operations in Vietnam . Some companies are worried about whether they will get there ahead of European and Asian competitors . But experts said that , even if business prospects are not as bright as some would portray them , there should be a substantial boost to the U.S. economy . * NEW CHALLENGES : End of embargo opens_up more opportunities for U.S. A7 * RELATED STORIES AND GRAPHICS : A5-7 , D1 Beginning a New Era President Clinton lifted the 19-year-old trade_embargo with Vietnam on Thursday , formally opening the way for commerce with Hanoi .
