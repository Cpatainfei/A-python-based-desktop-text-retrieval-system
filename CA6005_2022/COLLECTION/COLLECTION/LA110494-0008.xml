   <HEADLINE> GLASS ISSUE : IT ' S FAR FROM CLEAR ; TOKYO MOTIVES QUESTIONED AFTER DEADLINE IS BROKEN IN U.S.-JAPAN TRADE TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Japanese dichotomy of tatemae ( the way things are presented ) and honne ( actual motives or reality ) is brought_to mind by the failure of Washington and Tokyo to meet last Monday ' s deadline for finalizing an agreement for Japan to buy more U.S. glass . At issue is glass for autos and buildings . U.S. manufacturers have only a 1 % share of Japan ' s $ 4.5-billion glass market , compared to their shares of more_than 25 % in Europe and Latin_America . It was perhaps too_much to expect that in averting a trade war last month the United States and Japan would begin moving toward a new dialogue ending in the Japanese buying more U.S. exports . Some observers are wondering whether the trouble in reaching a final accord on flat glass undercuts Japan ' s recent tentative agreements to open its market to U.S. glass , medical and telecommunications_equipment and insurance . Even though Tokyo agreed to accept objective , enforceable standards to measure market progress , the glass talks apparently are hung_up over defining the specific criteria . Easing barriers to U.S. glass and other exports would carry substantial benefit for both nations , creating more jobs for Americans and cheaper prices for Japanese consumers . However , Tokyo is concerned that a freer and more competitive market would eliminate inefficient businesses and cost many Japanese workers their jobs . That worry seems to be reflected in the Japanese trade minister ' s indication that he is now pessimistic about restarting talks on the prickly issue of autos and auto parts imports , on which no agreement was reached during talks in October . So now comes the question of whether Tokyo merely appeared to cooperate on the trade agreements on glass and the other categories in_order to escape U.S. trade sanctions . Was the real intention simply to buy_time ? U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has said talks will continue for a limited period . He says there has been progress on all but three of 38 glass-related issues . Japanese officials separately have suggested an accord will be reached shortly -- but is that tatemae- speak or honne- speak ?</TEXT>
