   <HEADLINE> JUDGE DISQUALIFIES KUNSTLER , KUBY FROM N.Y. BOMB CONSPIRACY CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A judge disqualified civil_rights lawyers William Kunstler and Ron Kuby on Thursday from representing men accused of conspiring to bomb New York City landmarks , saying they faced potential conflicts_of_interest . U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey , whose ruling likely will force a delay in the scheduled Sept . 19 trial , noted that the lawyers had represented four defendants and several other people connected to the case , relationships that posed insurmountable problems . He said they also were potential unsworn witnesses in the case , in part because of public statements they made_out of a &quot; perceived need to correct a hostile public view of blameless clients. &quot; &quot; No one forced these lawyers to test-fly their defense theories in public and in court documents , and to say and do things that could be proved against their client at trial , &quot; Mukasey wrote . When faced with the conflicts_of_interest , the lawyers have &quot; either denied the existence of the problems . . . or trivialized them. &quot; The judge indicated , as prosecutors had a week ago , that some of the 13 defendants are likely to testify , including Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman . Prosecutors allege that the 56-year-old cleric guided the conspiracy to bomb landmarks including the United Nations , a building housing the FBI and two tunnels and a bridge connecting Manhattan to New Jersey .</TEXT>
