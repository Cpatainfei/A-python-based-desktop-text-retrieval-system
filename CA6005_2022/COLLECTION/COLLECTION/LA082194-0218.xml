   <HEADLINE> ANXIOUS MEXICANS AWAIT DAY OF THE VOTE ; ELECTIONS : DESPITE GOVERNMENT VOWS TO KEEP BALLOTING HONEST , MANY FEAR FRAUD , EVEN UNREST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the final week before today ' s crucial national elections , a municipal work crew appeared with pickaxes and sledgehammers on the steps below Mexico_City ' s guardian_angel , the towering bronze independence monument that is a traditional site of political protest . The workers chopped the steps to rubble , threw_up a plywood fence and sealed the angel off from the public -- and from any possible post-election unrest . &quot; Just look how clever our government is , &quot; an angry taxi driver said as he wheeled_around the shrouded angel one day last week . &quot; They ' ll do anything to control the people . For 65 years , they have had all_the power . It ' s time to fight_back . It ' s time for change . This year , for the first time , I ' m voting against them. &quot; The sequestered angel was a telling image on the eve of elections the government has promised -- and spent $ 2 billion trying to ensure -- will be a departure from the decades of authoritarian , one-party rule . With a civilian army of independent poll watchers , a $ 730-million computerized voter-registration system and other modernizations , the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has invested a fortune -- and Salinas ' personal legacy -- in electoral reforms . He vows that these improvements already have guaranteed that the balloting for a new president and most of a 628-seat Congress will be Mexico ' s cleanest , fairest elections since his ruling party took power in 1929 . But , as tens of millions of Mexicans pour into voting_booths from the Sierra Madre to the Gulf_of_Mexico , it is clear that the 45.7 million registered voters , and many in the government , share a skepticism as well as a fear of what changes today ' s democratic experiment may bring -- especially at a time of unprecedented uncertainty . For many , the primary fear is of fraud -- the traditional manipulation by the ruling party or outright election-day theft that has become known here as &quot; the black hand. &quot; &quot; We ' re going to see fraud ; we ' re going to see the black_hand under the table , &quot; said a well-educated lawyer who asked not to be identified , reflecting opinion polls that indicate most Mexicans doubt the elections will be free from fraud . &quot; The government has promised many reforms , but at the moment of truth there will be ballot_boxes stuffed and ballot_boxes stolen , and votes will disappear. &quot; Opposition leaders , backed by civic groups , have charged that already the election deck has been stacked against them . One highly detailed study of the largely pro-government media by the Civic Alliance watchdog group stated last week that during the weeks before the election , television viewers and radio listeners were twice as likely to see and hear Ernesto Zedillo , the presidential candidate of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , as_to see or hear any of his rivals . There also are widespread reports of physical intimidation . The Civic Alliance , an umbrella group of pro-democracy activists , announced that its volunteers and staff have been attacked and threatened . The opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party asserts that as_many as 200 of its members have been killed nationwide in the past several years , among them three aides to their candidate for governor of the southern state of Chiapas in a mysterious traffic accident last month . And on Thursday , local officials banned at the last moment a rock_concert the Civic Alliance had scheduled at the capital ' s Monument of the Revolution as a &quot; Music Festival for Peace and Democracy. &quot; Fueling the suspicions are decades of pent-up frustration over corruption , coercion and recent economic reforms that have widened the gap between Mexico ' s handful of rich and its masses of poor , according to half_a_dozen scientific opinion polls and interviews with scores of Mexicans . The election comes against the backdrop of an economy in which 37 families control about half the wealth while 35 million people live_in poverty , a reality that most voters said will drive their choices among nine political_parties today . There is a deep fear that cuts_across the country ' s economic and political lines . In a year that has seen Mexico ' s first assassination of a presidential candidate in more_than half a century and a guerrilla uprising in Chiapas , it is an anxiety that the mere perception of fraud will unleash a torrent of unrest -- one that some analysts speculate could lead to all-out insurrection . As a hedge against such a scenario , the government has gone_far beyond sealing_off the capital ' s angel of independence , a project that the city mayor ' s office refused to comment on despite repeated requests . The nation ' s police and army were standing by Saturday . Tens of thousands of additional forces have been deployed throughout Mexico_City and potential trouble spots in the countryside . In a controversial purchase that the government attributes simply to &quot; modernization , &quot; the army and security_forces acquired about $ 90 million worth of sophisticated riot-control equipment in the months leading_up to the election . And , amid the uncertainty , many Mexicans said they plan to return home from the polling_booths and stay there until they are certain of a peaceful result . &quot; This is very serious , &quot; said a 74-year-old woman near the capital ' s Plaza of Three Cultures , adding that she has voted_in every election since World_War_II . &quot; Before , I could be content with the election ( results ) . But now , I ' m worried . &quot; Everyone wants a change , but this change will be very costly. &quot; Hopes for fundamental change of the system that many voters believe was corrupted during more_than six decades of monolithic rule are almost universally shared . That one-word theme -- &quot; change &quot; -- has been the single common thread through the months-long campaign . Power-sharing and political reform have been the clarion calls not only of the two leading presidential challengers but of the ruling party candidate as well . Zedillo , 42 and U.S.-educated , has vowed to change his party from within . Taking the lead from Salinas -- who handpicked Zedillo after Luis Donaldo Colosio , the PRI ' s original presidential candidate , was assassinated at a Tijuana campaign rally in March -- Zedillo has promised to separate the ruling party from the government apparatus for the first time . He says he will open the party ' s furtive selection process for future candidates and respect the autonomy of a new Congress that most analysts expect will have a stronger opposition voice than in the past . The two other leading presidential candidates have promised somewhat more radical changes . Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , the bearded , quixotic candidate of the center-right , pro-business National Action Party ( PAN ) , ran with the slogan , &quot; The only secure change. &quot; He vowed to dismantle the entire corrupt political_system of government without abandoning its free-market economic reforms . Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , a former PRI member who left the party nearly a decade ago to lead a new leftist political alliance , has identified himself more with the indigent -- pledging populist reforms to close the gap between rich and poor . Cardenas , now running under the banner of the Democratic Revolutionary Party , believes that massive fraud cheated him out of the presidency in 1988 , a view shared by many voters . The final opinion polls released before a deadline 10 days ago showed Zedillo with a comfortable lead over Fernandez and far ahead of Cardenas . But the polls are rife_with contradictions , and experts suspect that fear tainted people ' s responses . The surveys that showed Zedillo well ahead also identified the key issues as poverty , unemployment , personal security and other matters on which an incumbent party is traditionally vulnerable . The surveys , in fact , were as unprecedented and unproven in Mexico as the exit polls and quick , independent counts that the government will permit for the first time ever after the last voting sites close at 6 p.m. today . Conducted at the 94 # 000 polling_stations nationwide , the exit polls will try to give a projection of the winner within hours of the close of voting . But critics and opposition leaders warn that the exit polls will not be as independent as they may seem . One count that is likely to be showcased tonight , they said , has been commissioned by the nation ' s largest television franchise , the National Chamber of Television and Radio Broadcasters , which is led by the pro-PRI Televisa network . Another quick count will be produced by the Civic Alliance , which is sponsoring many of the tens of thousands of Mexican poll watchers and helping to coordinate the nearly 1 # 000 foreign &quot; visitors &quot; the government is permitting to watch the voting for the first time . The first official results will be released by the government ' s new , quasi-independent election_commission , the Federal Electoral Institute , once it has counted at least 15 % of the vote -- not likely until after midnight tonight . The commission is headed by a Cabinet secretary appointed by the ruling party , but it includes representatives from all_the opposition parties . It has said it hopes to have enough results by midday Monday to project the official winner . The institute also will conduct its count based on satellite links with key voting stations . Among the government ' s unprecedented vote safeguards are laminated identity_cards that include holograms , computer bar_codes and thumbprints . And a Mexican technical institute developed an indelible_ink that will be placed on voters ' thumbs to prevent double voting . Polling station officials were selected at random in a double lottery , and the election_commission has built several backup systems into its central computer to prevent the &quot; crash &quot; that tainted the last presidential elections , in 1988 . In the final days before the vote , Mexicans interviewed randomly offered a wide range of contradictory opinions that reflected one of the most striking findings of the pre-election opinion polls : Just 10 days before the election , at least a quarter of all registered voters either said they were undecided or refused to state their preference for Mexico ' s next president . The lower-middle-class neighborhood surrounding the Plaza of Three Cultures illustrated that uncertainty and the history behind it . One monument on the plaza -- a vista that includes ancient Aztec ruins , a Spanish colonial church and mid-20th-Century apartment complexes -- marks the spot where , according to engravings at the site , Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes ' battle with the 16th-Century Aztec king led to &quot; the painful birth of the mestizo people that is the Mexico of today. &quot; A monument nearby commemorates another violent watershed in Mexico ' s history -- the Oct . 2 , 1968 , military crackdown on student demonstrators that left scores of protesters dead . &quot; Everyone says something is going_to happen during these elections , &quot; said 68-year-old Ana Martinez , sitting in the sunshine near the plaza last week . &quot; Maybe there will be violence . Nobody knows . But we are Mexicans , and we don ' t want violence . All I want is that the PRI doesn ' t win . The PRI has taken everything and carried_away the purse. &quot; Rodolfo Rodriguez , a 21-year-old student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and part-time handyman , stopped his bicycle to add his voice . He agreed with Martinez : &quot; There is much opposition to PRI on campus , and people there are much more conscious of politics. &quot; Both agreed they would probably vote for Cardenas . But when asked how the people in the rural villages might vote , Rodriguez smiled and said : &quot; The people there are asleep . They are not very well-prepared . Some are like sheep . And there will be a lot of fraud. &quot; On the other side of the plaza , Ricardo Repper Hernandez said he voted for Cardenas in 1988 . But he quickly added that he was still undecided last week . And for 80-year-old Hernandez , that was saying something . He said he has voted_in every election since soon after the PRI came_to power in 1929 . &quot; This man from the PAN ( Fernandez ) seems to be very competitive , very capable , and he ' s an exceptionally brilliant lawyer , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; Cardenas brings the glory of the past . He is the son of our greatest president , Lazaro Cardenas . Zedillo is young , very intelligent , but he lacks experience . But all three candidates are very capable , and any one of them could do a fine job. &quot; Hernandez insisted that , even at his age , he too wants to see change . &quot; The nation is waking_up . The PRI has 65 years in power . It ' s a dictatorship , &quot; he said . &quot; Therefore , this time , we think there ' s going_to be a change . that ' s what we hope. &quot; The retired furniture-store owner reflected on the question of whether the ruling party can , as Zedillo has insisted in scores of campaign rallies throughout the country , win a clean election . &quot; Well , it ' s like you hear a lot of us are saying these days , &quot; he said . &quot; Better the evil you know than the good you don ' t. &quot; But he also indicated he does not expect fraud : &quot; The reason everybody is interested in these elections now is because they will be credible. &quot; That grass-roots bottom_line would please Salinas , the architect of the reform package that promises so_much change . &quot; We are moving toward one event that has not been seen in Mexico in this century , &quot; the president said at one point during the heated campaign . &quot; Never has the candidate who placed second recognized the victory of the one who placed first . I believe that this will happen in these elections for the first time this century. &quot; Meeting the Candidates ERNESTO ZEDILLO , Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) * Born : Dec . 27 , 1951 * Married : To Nilda Patricia Velasco Nunez ; five children . * Education : Doctorate in economics , Yale ; bachelor ' s in economics , National Polytechnical Institute ( IPN ) , Mexico_City . * Career : Member of the PRI since 1971 ; campaign coordinator for the late Luis Donaldo Colosio ; various government posts including education_secretary and budget secretary . * Campaign promises : -- Decentralize government powers and cede more powers to state and municipal_governments ; separate PRI from the government , ending presidential power to name candidates . -- Continue current economic modernization , with increased emphasis on small business and jobs ; lower taxes . -- Restructure justice system , from the police_force to the Supreme Court .
