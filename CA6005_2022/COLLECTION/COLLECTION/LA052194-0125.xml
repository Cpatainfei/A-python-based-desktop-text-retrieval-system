   <HEADLINE> CAR HAS NO GENDER ; LYN ST . JAMES , WHO ASKS NO QUARTER AND GIVES NONE AS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE INDY 500 FIELD , WANTS TO BE JUDGED BY RESULTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The second row of this year ' s Indianapolis 500 field is one of the most intriguing in the race ' s 78 years . It has a rookie from Canada , Jacques Villeneuve , whose father , Gilles , was his country ' s greatest driving hero when he was killed in a Formula One race . Villeneuve , who was only 11 when his father died , is the fastest rookie ever with a qualifying speed of 226.259 m.p.h. It has Michael Andretti , the 1991 Indy car champion who missed last year ' s 500 while running Formula One , a series in which he did poorly . He is back in Indy cars and , as if to affirm his return , won the season opener in Australia . And , it has Lyn St . James , a 47-year-old woman who has not driven_in a race of any kind since last August . What makes this threesome so unusual is the three drivers in the row behind them -- a Hall_of_Fame lineup including 1992 Formula One champion Nigel Mansell and former 500 winners Arie Luyendyk and Mario Andretti . &quot; This is a strange place , &quot; former winner Bobby Rahal said of the circumstances . &quot; As I ' ve said to a number of people , and I don ' t mean to pick on Lyn by example -- she did a wonderful job here last week -- but to ( have her ) out-qualify Nigel Mansell in the factory Lola , I mean , that says something about the fact that anything can happen. &quot; St . James would agree , at least in part . She arrived here two weeks ago to drive an untested car for owner Dick Simon . She had a rookie crew chief with no crew and minimal sponsorship , despite having been in the last two Indy 500s . &quot; It ' s mystifying , isn ' t it ? &quot; she mused . &quot; We were at a severe disadvantage from the start , yet everything went our way . The first lap I had in the car ( a 1994 Lola-Ford Cosworth ) was the day the track opened . &quot; After the operation on my elbow ( to relieve a condition not related to racing ) , two days after the Michigan race ( last Aug . 1 ) , I was in a race_car only twice until I got here . I did three laps at Putnam Park in Indianapolis in December to get a visual feel_for the car , and I did 51 laps here at the Speedway on April 2 in the ' 92 car . That was it. &quot; After driving_in only six races last year before her sponsor pulled the plug , St . James was able to find support this year for only one race -- this one . &quot; Money is so tight that even if I won the 500 -- you know , anyone in the first three rows can win a race like this -- I don ' t think it would impact them to furnish me any more support , &quot; she said . &quot; I ran well at Michigan last year and look what happened. &quot; St . James set a women ' s closed-course record of 224.208 m.p.h. when she qualified at Michigan , but it was her last race . For a crew chief this year , she picked an old family friend , Emery Donaldson , who had worked with her when she started_out in Sports_Car Club of America races in Florida in the ' 70s . &quot; Emery worked for my ( first ) husband and was like one of the family , &quot; she said . &quot; He worked his way up the ranks in racing , and when I heard he was available , I gave him a call . He had always wanted to do Indy , and it helps when you have someone around you that you ' ve known for 20 years. &quot; Donaldson put_together a crew less than two weeks ago , working with Simon , who has put five cars in the 500 two years in a row . &quot; Dick is like a piece of gold , &quot; St . James said of the man who coached her through her first 500 qualifying two years ago when she was rookie of the year . &quot; On the racetrack , he lets Emery do the talking to me , but he still has that innate ability to be there when I need him . Two years ago , every time I came_in , that bald head was in my cockpit . He still listens to all_the dialogue ( between St . James and Donaldson ) on the earphones . I don ' t know how he does_it , with all_the drivers he has. &quot; Others driving for Simon here include Raul Boesel , who is in the middle of the front row ; Hiro Matsushita and rookies Dennis Vitolo and Hideshi Matsuda . Simon is also helping prepare Marco Greco and Tero Palmroth for qualifying attempts this weekend . St . James credits Human Performance International , a mind- and body-testing organization based in her hometown of Daytona Beach , Fla. , for keeping her fit mentally and physically for driving an 800 horsepower race_car at 200 m.p.h. for 500 miles . &quot; For me , it made the difference , &quot; she said of her training . &quot; I just wish I ' d had something like that years ago . It would have made me a better driver , much sooner . It ' s something every race driver should go_through . Nigel Mansell , ( the late ) Ayrton Senna , Emerson Fittipaldi and Al Unser Jr . are among those who have taken their course , and all_of them said it was a help . &quot; One of the big things is getting you to visualize driving at speed . I mean all_the bumps and curves and surprises , everything that happens during a lap . Almost as soon as I got_back in the car , it all came_back to me , because I had been visualizing it in my thoughts. &quot; Her four laps during qualifying last Saturday were uncommonly consistent . She varied only 0.038 seconds in lap times . &quot; I did six laps visually for every lap I ran , and I didn ' t screw_up a single corner , &quot; she said . &quot; I can ' t wait to get my hands on a tape of my qualifying and replay those four laps over and over . I guarantee you it will be worth every horrible day I ' ve ever had . It was as close to perfection as I can achieve. &quot; Despite her performance , she knows there are some who criticize a woman driving_in the Indy 500 . &quot; Auto racing is genderless , &quot; she said . &quot; The car doesn ' t know the difference , and no one can even see that it ' s a woman driving . No one judges me by my smile or personality , but by my results. &quot; And what of the future , 1995 and beyond ? &quot; I want a full season in Indy cars next year , &quot; she said . &quot; I haven ' t peaked yet. &quot;</TEXT>
