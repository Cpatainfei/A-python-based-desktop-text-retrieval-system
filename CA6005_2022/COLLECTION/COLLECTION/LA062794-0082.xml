   <HEADLINE> THE PACIFIC ; DESPITE ITS CRACKDOWN IN COMMODITIES , CHINA FAVORS TRADING OF BOND FUTURES ; MARKETS : THE DEBT_INSTRUMENTS HAVE BECOME THE GOVERNMENT ' S CHIEF CASH CROP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A week after the government announced a sweeping crackdown on futures trading , the young brokers in their red vests are still busy fielding phone_calls at the Beijing Commodities_Exchange . Occasionally , a group bursts into applause as prices jump again . Free-market dissidents ? Derivative disobedients ? Hardly . While trading copper and grain keeps some of the traders busy , it is treasury_bond futures that keep the phone_lines humming . Even traders who normally deal in agricultural futures have government_bond prices glimmering on their trading screens . And as far as China ' s crotchety leaders are concerned , that ' s all_right . China ' s Cabinet issued a notice last week calling_for most of the nation ' s futures markets to stop trading and banned brokerages from placing orders on overseas markets . The gerontocracy has singled_out the treasury_bond futures market as a necessary evil , however , one it is counting_on to stoke public enthusiasm for the $ 10 billion in bonds China is issuing to its citizens this year to as a way of raising cash without printing it in_order to pay its bills . &quot; The market for treasury_bonds , which was quite sluggish last year , has been invigorated by the impressive performance of the futures market , &quot; says You Ke , director of the Ministry of Finance ' s state debt department . It wasn ' t until 1992 that China was able to swallow the notion that futures trading was anything other_than a sophisticated form of gambling . It now has more_than 40 futures exchanges . A future is a commodity to be sold or delivered to its buyer at a date in the future . While many people trade futures contracts as a way to minimize the risk they incur when buying or selling commodities as part of doing business , others speculate in futures for commodities they never intend to own . No less than their counterparts in New York , London and Frankfurt , authorities in Beijing are concerned that speculation in futures and other derivatives may be a recipe for financial disaster . &quot; Lots of central_banks and companies around the world have been discussing whether to allow derivatives to be controlled or not . China is also controlling this issue , &quot; said You . China ' s historic fear of inflation has a lot to do with its urge to curb futures trading . &quot; There is a misconception that futures trading is closely linked to inflation , &quot; says Liu Ruizhong , vice_president of the Beijing Commodities_Exchange . Inflation connotes cataclysm to China ' s leaders in a way the Federal_Reserve or the Bundesbank could never fathom . It was inflation that generated public support for the democracy movement that culminated in the Tian An Men tragedy in 1989 . In May of this year , China ' s inflation_rate dipped , with retail prices rising 18.9 % year-on-year , down from 19.5 % in April but still well above the target of less than 10 % set by Premier Li Peng in March . Sugar , steel and coal futures have been banned , as a result , because the government thought prices for those products were rising too_much . And on the floor below the busy Beijing Commodities_Exchange , the lights at the Beijing Petroleum Exchange are off and the doors bolted . Last month , Beijing decided speculation on the price of oil was fueling inflation and ordered the exchange closed . Bonds , however , are the government ' s chief cash crop . It has sold more_than 90 % of the $ 10 billion in two- and three-year treasury_bonds it planned to issue this year . Last year , it issued one-third as much . Bond futures prices are heading in a favorable direction for the government , having risen 10 % to 20 % at the Beijing exchange this year . Turnover at its 313 seats hit a healthy $ 162 million today , almost half of which was in state treasury_bond futures contracts . The bond fad has taken a toll on stock_market activity . Shanghai ' s benchmark stock index has fallen roughly 50 % in the past year , in part because investors were selling stocks in_order to buy bonds .</TEXT>
