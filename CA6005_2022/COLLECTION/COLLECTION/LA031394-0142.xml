   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; IN SEARCH OF THE HOTTEST MUSIC IN TOWN ; L.A. ' S STORIED ROCK CLUBS FIZZLED IN THE PAY-TO-PLAY ' 80S , BUT TODAY ' S REVITALIZED SCENE IS THRIVING ON A HEALTHY DOSE OF UNDERGROUND SPIRIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> People in the audience at Jabberjaw , a small , kitsch-adorned club on Pico Boulevard in a dilapidated Midtown neighborhood , duck as bucketfuls of fried chicken and biscuits whiz past their heads . The finger-lickin ' goods are being hurled by Southern Culture on the Skids , a bizarre trio from North Carolina that has found a niche in the underground rock scene by celebrating its white_trash roots . As a final drumstick slides greasily off a patron ' s jacket , the band resumes playing , filling the club with intentionally wrong notes . Through it all , the audience does its best to look Jack Kerouac-cool , but is charmed enough to reward the band with loud applause at the end of its set . A few miles away at Raji ' s , a subterranean club near Hollywood and Vine , a frazzled blond named Beck sings , &quot; I ' m a loser baby , so why don ' t you kill me ? &quot; with his back to the audience . When he finished his set of acoustic-backed poetry on everything from squashed Twinkies to Walkmans , the crowd applauds , and he bows to the back wall before exiting the stage . On the border of Beverly Hills , LunaPark is serving arty and eclectic entertainment -- from drag queens to psychedelic duos -- for the 90210 crowd . While a flamenco guitarist plays , a cameraman from a local TV_station asks patrons whether drugs are making a comeback in upper-crust club culture . Two customers sip their mineral_water thoughtfully before one replies , &quot; I don ' t know. &quot; These moments reflect the diversity and vitality of today ' s revitalized Los Angeles rock club scene -- a raw , creative environment that is rebounding after losing much of its edge_in recent years . The L.A. scene was born in the mid- ' 60s , when bands such_as the Doors honed their skills at clubs on the Sunset Strip , and it escalated in the ' 70s as Los Angeles took_over from New York as the commercial center of the pop world . The record industry ' s presence in Los Angeles initially enriched the club scene , as venues played host in the early ' 70s to such emerging acts_as Jackson Browne , the Eagles and Van Halen , all_of whom went_on to significant success . But that commercial thrust ultimately proved a curse : By the end of the decade , clubs and rehearsal halls were filled with formulaic bands playing generic hard rock and sappy pop . The real energy shifted underground , driven by an anti-Establishment credo that spawned what evolved into today ' s alternative-rock scene . Bands from Black_Flag and the Germs to X and the Blasters put into practice a &quot; do-it-yourself &quot; ethic by creating indie record labels and playing anywhere they could plug_in an amp . By the mid- ' 80s , glam bands such_as Motley Crue , who made no bones about their aims for fame and fortune , took_over the Strip and kicked_off the big-hair rock trend . The L.A. scene then became known as a cheesy metal mecca until later in the decade , when Guns N ' Roses redeemed the city ' s reputation temporarily . Punk / metal thrived at clubs like Riki Rachtman ' s Cathouse and Dayle Gloria ' s Scream . With all these bands knocking at their door , Sunset Strip clubs such_as Gazzarri ' s , the Roxy , the Whisky and Troubadour introduced a controversial policy called &quot; pay-to-play. &quot; Bands now had to pay the club or promoter to play , as opposed to the venue paying them . The scene was no longer ruled by the best bands , but by the ones that could buy their way on stage . Seeing the deterioration of the scene , musicians who might have once been drawn to Los Angeles to get a deal or just play to a bigger audience stayed in Seattle or San Diego and started their own scenes . While this new generation of bands , from the critically adored Nirvana to hard-core purists Fugazi , carried_on the spirit of L.A. ' s underground club scene in their hometowns , bands began to protest outside the Sunset Strip clubs . By the early ' 90s , the pay-to-play venues were stagnant and dull , and new clubs with a rawer appeal began to spring_up in converted office_buildings and restaurants . Bands were again booked on merit rather than money . Gazzarri ' s went_under as clubs like Raji ' s and Jabberjaw became successful . The Whisky and Troubadour got wise in the past year and a half and have almost pulled_away from the pay-to-play policies , re-emerging as more relevant venues . The majority of bands now playing these places come from around the country , but many are descendents of L.A. ' s punk scene . &quot; The L.A. scene has really turned itself around by going underground again , &quot; says Bill Holdship , editor of the nearly 20-year-old California rock magazine Bam . &quot; Bands know that it ' s the little coffeehouses and dives that have the credibility , and those are the best places to start . They ' ve pumped life back into the city. &quot; Adds Tom Carolan , an Atlantic Records A &amp; R executive who works with Stone Temple Pilots and the Lemonheads , &quot; Musicians aren ' t stupid any more . They respect the integrity of small places like Jabberjaw. &quot; Here are the 10 key clubs on the scene for bands and fans , picked for their calibre of acts and informal ambience . Some of them have been around for years , but even they seem re-energized by the back-to-basics spirit that infuses the music . They are where you can hear the best of the new music -- from bands just breaking on MTV to bands just breaking_out of the basement . * Jabberjaw Coffeehouse and Art_Gallery 3711 W . Pico Blvd . Tuesday through Sunday . Times vary . All ages . Southern Culture on the Skids , drumsticks and all , is typical of the offbeat attractions that grace the stage of this funky , no-frills room , whose anonymous exterior is hardly distinguishable from the deserted storefronts that neighbor it . The club has featured the garage-pop sounds of L7 as well as the petrifying dissonance of Courtney Love ' s quartet Hole and the post-hard-core of Rocket From the Crypt -- long before these bands were signed to major labels . Fiercely independent bands such_as &quot; riot grrrl &quot; leaders Bikini Kill and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion have also packed the long , narrow structure . As Southern Culture plays , Jabberjaw employees serve coffee while they shake their beehive wigs and shimmy in stretch pants that Doris Day would have killed for . Paintings of big-eyed clowns and children stare sadly down at the alcohol-free coffee_bar that faces the stage . A &quot; Welcome Back Kotter &quot; board_game and KISS dolls are among the other kitsch items hanging_on a wall that vibrates to the music . * Fuzzyland Call_for location and dates . ( 213 ) 969-1433 . Over 21 . Chicago group Royal Trux grinds_out anesthetized mutations of classic rock as singer Jennifer Herrema belts indecipherable lyrics from under her mass of tangled hair . The scene is Mr. T ' s Bowl , a Highland Park bowling_alley that the roving club Fuzzyland has taken_over for the night . Unused lanes packed with junk lie behind the stage , and the clank of beer_bottles replaces the crash of pins . The band ' s dense noise is driving_out the last of the bar ' s daytime regulars , who delayed the Trux show by occupying the main floor to watch boxing on the big-screen TV . Fuzzyland is a concept club that happens whenever creator Jac Zinder gets the inclination , which is usually twice a month and always on Saturday . It often runs with a theme -- such_as &quot; the Evening of Dangerous Hicks , &quot; pirate night and clown night -- and patrons dress accordingly . Bands from England ' s trance-masters Stereolab to L.A. feedback manipulators Medicine have played Fuzzyland , and Zinder complements the cutting-edge shows by spinning obscure dance records between and after the acts . Tonight , under the low , sparkling , smoke-stained ceilings , a heavy-metal mime band and a country group headed by industrial-rock hellion Carla Bozulich open for Royal Trux . A late-night crowd dressed in everything from rotting leather gear to Levi ' s to blue lame chaps has packed into the narrow hall that leads to the dance_floor and stage . &quot; I book whatever I can throw_together , &quot; says Zinder , an L.A. native who started the club over a year ago . &quot; If I can ' t get an act , I ' ll just make something up. &quot; that ' s when Zinder features off-the-wall acts such_as the karaoke punk band the Worm Boys and performance artists who dress as teddy_bears . * The Auditorium 6356 Hollywood Blvd. , Hollywood Call_for schedule . All ages . It ' s hard to imagine the beefy singer Tad Doyle , who heads the Seattle band called Tad , thundering around on the tiny , floor-level stage at the Auditorium , but he manages . The group , whose sound is as thick and weighty as its leader ' s frame , is part of the stream of raw bands that keep the room ' s mosh pit in motion . Like Nirvana , Tad is a band that has gone from the hip , underground Sub Pop label to a major record company , but the Auditorium gig provides a low-profile chance for the group to return to its roots . The second-story room , which used to house a beauty school , sits at the top of a wooden staircase near Hollywood and Vine . Inside , broken-down couches and chairs add_to the grass-roots ambience of the club , which was put_together by the transplanted British industrial-rock group Tunnelmental . It ' s run strictly by the band and operates_on the anyone-can-do-it spirit that fueled early punk-rock clubs . The alcohol-free venue features mainly local bands such_as San Diego ' s tribal percussion outfit Crash Worship , but also grabs whatever underground bands coming_through town it can -- from the Japanese noise group the Boredoms to the Mexican techno group Artefacto . Its unrestricted age policy allows kids to experience up-and-coming bands in an intimate setting . &quot; There ' s always a part of me that wants to be an idiotic punk-rock rebel , &quot; says Tunnelmental leader Bif . &quot; Los Angeles needs a local scene . It lacks it because there ' s so_much competition and everything has this industry , showcase appeal . It takes all_the art away from it. &quot; * LunaPark 665 N . Robertson Blvd . West Hollywood Open nightly . Times vary . Age varies night to night . Right off a ritzy stretch of Robertson , just above Melrose , Andy Palcaio plays a sweat-inducing strain of aggressive Calypso , charming the arty crowd in the stylish cellar of this intimate , upscale club . On another night , the atmospheric group Downy Mildew plays its moody , ambient rock , and Exene Cervenka sings her urban folk . Eclecticism is the byword at this 5-month-old space , where three separate rooms offer an offbeat variety of entertainment for the goatee-and-beret crowd and the offspring of L.A. ' s economically privileged . Dinner is served along with the entertainment in the main room of this spacious venue . A large back_room just opened , and owner-booker Jean-Pierre Boccara plans to feature everything from punk poet Henry Rollins to performance artist Ann Magnuson . Patrons can escape the music and hit the outside patio for a breather . &quot; There are , like , 10 words to describe L.A. , starting with trendy , snobby and grungy , &quot; says Boccara , a Frenchman who used to run the equally arty but grittier Lhasa Club , and then the Largo on Fairfax . &quot; We want to add new words to the old ones . We want to bridge the gaps not only between musical genres , but between stereotypes and age groups. &quot; * Sin-a-Matic 7969 Santa Monica Blvd . West Hollywood Saturday nights . Over 18 . Dark and lusty dance_music fills Sin-a-Matic . Deejay Joseph is spinning rare , imported grooves for a leather-clad crowd . The previous week , the risque and showy dance_band My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult performed . This is one of the few venues in L.A. where you can catch the latest techno stars before they hit the major labels , or see industrial dance acts such_as Ethyl Meatplow mix sexy , provocative stage antics with an addictive beat . The three-room club also offers the delightfully obscure . Electronic noise pioneers Psychic TV and up-and-coming percussion-with-keyboards group Beat Mistress have moved booties across the club ' s main dance_floor . This night , a young_woman in a tight nurse ' s uniform shakes her hips on the dance_floor to the dark beat of the Revolting Cocks ' &quot; Da Ya Think I ' m Sexy ? &quot; single . A middle-aged man with Pollyanna braids wearing only construction boots and a vertical strip of cloth jiggles to the driving sounds of Meat Beat Manifesto . &quot; We want to expose people to a lot of different things , &quot; says Joseph Brookes , who runs Sin-a-Matic with his partner James Stone . &quot; It ' s too easy to always listen to the same thing . that ' s why people come here , for a taste of the strange and new. &quot; * Highland Grounds 742 N . Highland Ave . Open nightly , 9-12:30 . All ages . Offering a chance to sip top-notch java while watching acoustic music , Highland Grounds is a welcome rest stop between the feedback and noise of the Auditorium and the dark beat of Sin-a-Matic . It offers mostly amateur artists unplugged -- from Chinese and Albanian groups to rockabilly and blues . Many a guitar strum and earnest lyric -- from the_likes_of country-rock heroine Rosie Flores to rock-spoofing Spinal_Tap -- have bounced off the high ceilings of the club , whose setting includes a small balcony area and a lush mini-jungle of a patio . Funky , sculptured metal tables and chairs fill the bright space of the laid-back venue , while a large coffee and food bar churns_out the joe . The food is actually edible ( a rarity in the coffeehouse world ) , and dining among the patio ' s numerous trees and tall plants somehow makes_it all_the more enticing . &quot; I ' m always looking_for the next Bob Dylan to walk in , but we ' re mainly a neighborhood place , a place where locals can play , &quot; says Rich Brenner , the club ' s co-owner . * Troubadour 9081 Santa Monica Blvd . West Hollywood Open nightly . Times vary . All ages . Liz Phair sings insightful and blunt lyrics about one-night stands , boring sex and sleazy guys . The jam-packed crowd hangs_on every word from the latest underground rock_star , and rightly so . The songwriter ' s debut album is smart , raw and hard-hitting . She ' s just one in the string of many worthy acts that the Troubadour has booked in the last year . The 35-year-old club , on a high-rent stretch of Santa Monica Boulevard , is dumping its former image as a glam-metal club to change with the times . The Troubadour once featured some of the best acts of the ' 60s and ' 70s , from Lenny Bruce to Joni Mitchell and Elton John . Doug Weston ' s club then got_into the metal scene in the ' 80s -- and stayed there . The club started picking_up in the last few years , and while paintings of macho metal heroes such_as Vince Neil and Jon Bon Jovi still decorate the main showroom , the club is taking steps_in new directions by booking fresh independent and major-label alternative acts_as well as respected folk artists . Some of the recent attractions include the Breeders , speed-core band Helmet and seedy lounge-rockers Morphine , as well as Joan Baez , Guy Clark and jazz diva Cassandra Wilson . &quot; We ' re trying to diversify and get_back to the respected level we once were , &quot; says Lance Hubp , the club ' s manager and promoter . &quot; It ' s really not that hard ' cause there ' s a lot of great music out there now. &quot; * The Gaslight and Gaslight II 1608 Cosmo St. , Hollywood Sundays , 7 p.m.-2 a.m ; Wednesdays , 9 p.m.-2 a.m. Over 21 . To the average passer-by , Cosmos bar , where the Gaslight club is located , may seem like just another Hollywood dive , and for good reason . Until a group of club promoters took it over two years ago , it was a smoky barfly haven . Now , five local bands grace its tiny stage every Sunday at Gaslight and Wednesday at Gaslight II , playing to a party-minded crowd of mainly Hollywood locals . On this night , Green_Thumb pounds out shards of driving rock to an audience that ' s dancing , socializing , playing pool and just plain hanging out . The group is one of the many unsigned , local bands , such_as Loungefly and S.T.S. , that the Gaslight I and II feature regularly . The feel here is that of a neighborhood pub rather than a Hollywood showcase , and most of the bands that play here are casual enough to fit right in . Patrons in faded T-shirts and jeans talk_over the music in cubbyholes around the cavernous club . Upstairs , couples smooch in a comfortable room on satiny , granny-style furniture . The pool_tables next to the dance_floor are constantly in_use , while the small brick patio boasts a quieter appeal . The rest of the week the bar is host to different clubs that feature jazz_bands and deejays spinning hip-hop and retro tunes . &quot; There ' s way more bands than there are places to play , &quot; says Dayle Gloria , who books shows at the Gaslight along with Mary Nixon . &quot; It ' s just a matter of giving them a chance at this level , and then sitting_back to see what happens. &quot; * Raji ' s 6160 Hollywood Blvd . Hollywood Open Tuesday through Sunday . Times vary . Over 21 . The acoustic guitarist Beck plays an entire set -- including his KROQ hit &quot; Loser &quot; -- with his back to the audience . Regulars who look as if they ' re wearing the clothes they slept_in are crammed into the seedy , subterranean restaurant , alongside record-industry types wanting to get_a_look at this newest weird wonder on the L.A. rock scene . &quot; Raji ' s has been a forum for a lot of artists like Beck , &quot; says the veteran club ' s promoter Riff Mercy . &quot; No other club let them play because of their obscure nature . that ' s what Raji ' s is for -- the freaky stuff. &quot; Nirvana has played here . So has L7 , and lesser-known local stars such_as Pigmy Love Circus and New Improved God . The club has been a fixture on the scene for 10 years , and 90 % of the bands that play here are local and unsigned . It ' s hit and miss , but a sure way to see something different . Says Mercy : &quot; A lot of industry people go_to see bands and a lot showcase here because we specialize in music away from the norm -- not the everyday MTV thing . When people want a taste of something different , they come here. &quot; * Whisky a Go-Go 8901 Sunset Blvd . West Hollywood Open nightly . All Ages . This is the grand old Los Angeles rock club -- a fixture since the ' 60s that has played host over the years to everyone from Led Zeppelin to Elvis Costello to Smashing Pumpkins . On this night , yet another in an endless string of promising new bands -- the Dutch group Bettie Serveert , with its endearing lead singer Carol van Dijk -- is causing a buzz . Like the Troubadour , the Whisky lost some of its glamour in the ' 80s when it flirted_with a pay-to-play policy , but it has rebounded in recent years with a dazzling array of newcomers , from England ' s PJ Harvey to Soul Asylum ( before &quot; Runaway Train &quot; ) to Yo La Tengo . If you want to hear something new , yet sample the history and tradition of Los Angeles rock , the Whisky is where you go . The club is every bit as indestructible as rock ' n ' roll itself .</TEXT>
