   <HEADLINE> TEACHING THE HOLOCAUST ' S LESSONS TO BLACK YOUTHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scholars searching for ways to broaden the lessons of the Holocaust told an audience at Los Angeles ' most prominent black church Thursday that Nazis murdered and mutilated African American prisoners_of_war because of their race , and sterilized young children of mixed German and African blood . The presentation of previously unpublicized research was organized by the Martyrs Memorial and Museum of the Holocaust in Los Angeles , which is working with local teachers and researchers to develop curriculum supplements for secondary_school students . Researchers told listeners at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church that documents from Nazi war_crimes trials show that blacks -- both Americans and soldiers from Africa serving in the armies of colonial powers -- were singled_out for mistreatment once they were captured by the Nazis . In one case , said Robert Kesting , an archivist at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , 11 captured African American soldiers were humiliated by SS officers and forced to carry them on their backs before they were tortured , executed and mutilated . Other black soldiers were forced to dig their own graves before they were executed . Although white soldiers were also mistreated by Germans , Kesting said blacks tended to be treated worse because of their race : Nazis considered people of African descent , as well as Jews , Gypsies and handicapped people , to be &quot; race polluters. &quot; In a horrific example of Nazi eugenics -- the pseudo-science of genetically &quot; improving &quot; the human_race -- hundreds of half-black , half-German children , ages 6 to 12 , were sterilized under government dictates in the 1930s , Kesting said . The children , labeled the &quot; Rhineland bastards , &quot; were for the most part the offspring of German women who married African soldiers who were part of the_French army occupying western Germany after World_War I . Hundreds of the children later disappeared without a trace . The 14-year-old Holocaust memorial organization , run_by the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles , sponsored Thursday ' s lecture in response to the controversy that erupted after some black high_school students in Oakland were kicked_out of a movie_theater for laughing_at scenes of the murder of Jews in &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Educators , struggling to get students interested in history that seems long ago and far away , said they believe the greater scope of genocide will hit_home to African American students if they are taught that people of African descent were also persecuted by the Nazis . Students need to understand that &quot; it could have been me , &quot; said Suzanne Riveles , a political_scientist who teaches at Howard University and participated in Thursday ' s lecture . The Rev . Leonard Jackson , associate minister of First AME , said interest in the Holocaust in the black community is &quot; little or nothing. &quot; &quot; It is easy to look_at a story such_as ' Schindler ' s List ' and say , ' So what ? ' But if you realize . . . it was not just Jewish individuals , it was African Americans , black_Africans . . . that ' s what makes a difference. &quot; Museum Director Alex Grobman said the students in Oakland were unfairly criticized . They were simply unfamiliar_with the history , he said , and could not understand that the events on screen really happened . He said he later took several of the students on a tour of the museum and found them &quot; very receptive. &quot; In their search for ways to teach the Holocaust in a broader context , Grobman and Allan Scholl , the museum ' s education specialist , began looking_for Holocaust stories that involved blacks . They found Kesting and Riveles . Riveles said the racist attitudes of some Nazi officials were shaped by their experiences in German colonies in Africa , where they began to consider some races &quot; subhuman. &quot; &quot; Germans . . . carried racial attitudes toward Africans very far . . . . They later attributed similar negative features to the ' Negro of Europe ' -- the European Jew , &quot; she said . Riveles was born in Berlin , and although her family is not Jewish , she suffered at the hands of the Nazis . Her father was executed for his role in Resistance activities . She later earned her Ph.D. in African studies at Howard University , and she has worked with Amnesty International . Riveles said it is important to keep telling stories from the past because the racist attitudes they reflect live_on today . First AME ' s Jackson agreed : &quot; You ask the Jewish population , ' Why do you continue to talk_about the Holocaust ? ' People continue to ask black people , ' Why talk_about history , it happened a long_time ago. ' ( But ) as long as we keep it on the front page we won ' t allow it to happen again. &quot;</TEXT>
