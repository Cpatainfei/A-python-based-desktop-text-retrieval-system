   <HEADLINE> CHOLERA WANES AS TENSIONS RISE IN ZAIRE CAMPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The existence that passes as living for the 1 million Rwandan refugees in this country grew better Thursday , and , of course , worse -- and all_the while more tangled and troubling . Finally , the rising tide of cholera , which killed so many thousands , was declared medically contained . The squalid camps spread north and south of here even began to show the faint sparks of vigor . But with vigor has come new tensions , killing and the threat of spreading political discontent . &quot; The cholera epidemic is over , &quot; said Panos Moumtsis , spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees . &quot; The curve of death , as we call it , is going down. &quot; By that , the agency said it was expressing the consensus of the many relief groups assisting here on the Rwandan border . But only by the abstract medical definition is the epidemic anywhere near over . The brutal , humiliating death of uncontrollable diarrhea and dehydration still claimed perhaps 700 lives Thursday . It will take 700 more lives today , hundreds more tomorrow and the next day -- and for days to come . But because improvements in the flow of supplies and clean water have led to a reduction in the number of deaths from a daily high of 1 # 800 to 2 # 000 a week ago , and since the number of new cases reported is also declining , the technical conditions of epidemic have passed . The U.N. refugee agency said , however , that deaths from dysentery were mounting each day , with uncertain prospects for control . If the surviving refugees could take some solace from their misery as they rested and fed themselves on the increasing amounts of relief food , they faced renewed fears : their own vulnerability to the defeated army that led them out of Rwanda and to the robber instincts of the underpaid soldiers from Zaire who have greeted them here . &quot; Security is getting_worse and tensions are building_up fast , &quot; Moumtsis said . Refugees on Thursday pounced on a Zairian guard outside the outlying camp called Katale and hacked him to death with machetes . Intervention by U.N. refugee officials prevented a swift retaliatory attack by other Zairian soldiers . But alarm spread through the refugee ranks -- in some places automobiles stopped in the middle of the road and blocked traffic so the driver could shout_out news of the killing and warn of the danger of reprisals . Relief officials said refugees had suffered repeated robberies and extortion by Zairian soldiers . In this case , the checkpoint sentry reportedly demanded money from a Rwandan refugee who tried to drive into the camp in his car , bearing Rwandan plates . Refugees with cars , radios and other possessions are presumed_to be people of means and quick targets for soldiers , who are paid virtually nothing in Zaire . * All over Goma , Zairian soldiers could be seen driving confiscated vehicles . Armed soldiers were seen stopping cars and trucks with Rwandan plates . Independent relief workers and journalists also have reported extortion by soldiers in Zairian uniforms . Local authorities said they would attempt to investigate the attack but more pressing was the Zairian commander ' s demand for the return of the slain soldier ' s rifle . Tensions also are mounting between Goma ' s civilians and the refugees . The huge influx here has driven_up the cost_of_living to Klondike standards . A 50-cent bottle of beer now costs $ 8 , a $ 25 bag of sugar is more_than $ 60 . Local farmers say Rwandans are ravaging their banana plantations and vegetable crops . Farmers on Thursday demanded that Zairian authorities take firmer control of refugees , and at least one camp was ordered evacuated and relocated farther from town . Meanwhile , what sounded to be nearby , intermittent automatic_rifle fire was heard from the direction of the refugee camp where former members of the Rwandan army are segregated , supposedly separate from the general refugee population . Relief officials said the weaponry display demonstrated that attempts to disarm the defeated , bitter soldiers had been unsuccessful . It also showed civilian refugees that their old army was not entirely toothless , as it continued to demand that Rwandans not return home . Augustin Rusanganwa , a former official in the defeated Rwandan government , said the goal was to keep refugees in camps in the hope -- no matter how vague and grasping -- that their tragedy would so alarm the world that global intervention in Rwanda would be inevitable . &quot; The international community has to bring_about negotiations , &quot; he said . &quot; The war in Rwanda was not a political war , but a tribal war . What I don ' t understand and what many refugees don ' t understand is how the West , how the U.S.A. , can accept a minority group taking_over the country . that ' s not democracy at all. &quot; The defeated government , its army and nearly all_the refugees here are Hutus , who recently accounted_for 85 % of Rwanda ' s population . The Rwandan Patriotic Front , which won the war , is predominantly Tutsi .</TEXT>
