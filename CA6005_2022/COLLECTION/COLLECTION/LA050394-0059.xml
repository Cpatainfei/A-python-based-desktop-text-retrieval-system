   <HEADLINE> WORLD_VIEW ; KEEPING THE PEACE : U.N. GETS MIXED REACTION TO GOAL ; CLINTON AGREES WITH THE IDEA BUT INTENDS TO STRICTLY LIMIT U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN MISSIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In their first weeks on_the_job , Clinton_Administration officials , flush with the excitement of fresh ideas , prepared a paper for their boss ' signature on the role of U.S. troops in peacekeeping missions of the United Nations . Peacekeeping had become the fashionable defense concept of the New World Order , and no one anticipated much of a delay before President Clinton would sign that paper -- Presidential Review Directive 13 . But the mood over peacekeeping soon soured in Washington , and the official paper languished and metamorphosed for more_than a year . Now , the White_House says Clinton is ready to sign the latest version , probably Thursday , 15 months after the first draft of PRD 13 . The signature -- even after so_long a delay -- signals a significant move forward . U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping seemed doomed last October when 18 U.S. Rangers died as the result of a raid in Somalia during the frenzied manhunt for warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid . The deaths shocked Clinton into ordering the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Somalia within five months and made him reluctant to commit any more troops to future peacekeeping ventures . Yet , even while the President put U.S. peacekeeping in official paralysis , a host of universities and think_tanks churned_out innumerable reports and seminars on peacekeeping as a key element of modern defense_policy . The roster of sponsors includes the U.S. Naval Academy , the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , the Henry L . Stimson Center , Columbia University , the National Defense University , the United Nations Assn . of the U.S.A. and Amnesty International . On top of all this , said one U.S. military analyst , &quot; this subject commands more time on behalf of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff than any other subject. &quot; Analysts persist_in pushing international peacekeeping because there seems no alternative for maintaining order . As U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said it in a recent news_conference : &quot; Public_opinion in the United States is not eager for that country to play the role of world policeman . The United Nations is there to do that job , and there is a consensus that despite all_the difficulties , despite all_the contradictions , the only forum existing today that can play this role is the United Nations. &quot; As he prepared to sign PRD 13 , Clinton evidently agreed -- though with a good number of conditions . U.N. peacekeeping may still be the fashionable defense_policy of the day , but a lot of problems have to be cleared_up , including the exact nature of U.S. participation , the quick assembly of forces and the untangling of command in small U.N. armies made_up of many nationalities . Peacekeeping is undergoing a hard look these days . No longer locked into impotence by U.S.-Soviet enmity and vetoes , the Security_Council has dealt with a rash of crises by dispatching peacekeeping missions throughout the world . In the first 40 years , the Security_Council authorized 13 peacekeeping operations . In the last nine years , it has launched 20 . As of March , the United Nations ran 17 peacekeeping missions with 72 # 000 troops and police at an annual cost of $ 3.2 billion . The more recent missions have been far more complex than the old missions , which amounted to little more_than patrolling of cease-fire lines . &quot; Peacekeeping done_by a British cop with just a whistle and no stick is no longer feasible , &quot; said Gen . Philippe Morillon of France after his return from command of the U.N. operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Several of the newer missions -- such_as those in Bosnia and Somalia -- involve enforcement of order and the creation of national institutions , such_as a police_force and a judiciary . In the wake of the Somalia withdrawal , the U.S. contribution of peacekeepers is meager . The United States now has 714 troops in three missions : the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia , western Sahara and Israeli cease-fire lines . Thirty other countries -- led by France with 6 # 603 troops deployed -- have more peacekeepers on U.N. duty . Even tiny Jordan has dispatched almost five times as_many . The U.S. hesitation has created resentment in some quarters . &quot; We will never have clean wars , &quot; Morillon said , evidently exasperated by the Clinton_Administration ' s peacekeeping policy . &quot; You have to be ready to fight , you have to be ready to die . Clean wars do not exist. &quot; But the United States is not the only country wary of peacekeeping now that it has taken ugly turns . After 10 Belgian paratroopers were killed in Rwanda in a vain attempt to save the life of the prime_minister from marauding Hutus in early April , Belgium announced that it was withdrawing its troops from the U.N. peacekeeping mission there . Nevertheless , though all worry about public_opinion , democratic governments such_as France , Britain and Canada are far more willing to let their troops don the United Nations ' blue helmets and berets than the United States . U.S. officials and members of Congress often rationalize the U.S. reluctance by saying that U.S. soldiers are more vulnerable than others because gunmen relish the prestige of killing a representative of the world ' s only superpower . While this may be true , the U.S. reluctance still handicaps the United Nations sorely , because many governments tend to follow Washington ' s lead . When Clinton decided to withdraw the Americans from Somalia , Kofi Annan of Ghana , the undersecretary general for peacekeeping , said it was difficult to persuade other world leaders to send troops to an area that the U.S. President believes is too dangerous for his own troops . The U.N. mission in Somalia is now dominated by India , Pakistan and other Third_World countries . Although the contents of PRD 13 have not been made public , Assistant Secretary_of_Defense Edward L . Warner III revealed the essential details in testimony a_few weeks ago before a Senate Armed Services subcommittee . Warner said that , under the new policy , the United States would take_part in a U.N. peacekeeping mission only when : * The mission advances U.S. interests . * The level of risk is acceptable . * The operation would fail without U.S. participation . * The probable length and exit date for the mission are known . In addition , U.S. forces would always be under U.S. command , meaning the President and U.S. officers would always have the final authority to issue orders covering every aspect of U.S. military operations . But , in some cases , the Clinton_Administration might put the U.S. troops under U.N. control , meaning a U.N. commander could assign a task for a U.S. unit to do under its American commander . Warner also said that the United States , which is now assessed 31 % of U.N. peacekeeping costs , would try to reduce that assessment to 25 % . While trying to produce a coherent policy on peacekeeping , the Clinton_Administration has been skittish for months about seeming gung-ho . Warner ' s testimony reflected this . &quot; Peace operations are not the centerpiece of U.S. foreign and defense_policy , &quot; he said . &quot; Our peacekeeping policy review has not been an effort to expand U.N. peacekeeping or U.S. involvement in U.N. operations . Rather , it is an effort to improve the U.N. and its ability to undertake peace operations . . . and to make better use of American contributions. &quot; Yet he also testified that the Pentagon had started training military_units for &quot; the unique challenges associated with peace operations &quot; and was developing new equipment , such_as &quot; belly plates &quot; for armored personnel_carriers , and non-lethal crowd_control weapons for peacekeeping . As a practical matter , the conditions laid_down in PRD 13 , if followed strictly , would likely keep U.S. troops out of most peacekeeping operations . &quot; If you need to know the exit date before you go_into an operation , &quot; a former senior official of the State_Department said , &quot; you will never go in. &quot; U.N. officials were angered last September when Clinton , addressing the General_Assembly , said : &quot; If the American people are to say yes to peacekeeping , the United Nations must know when to say no. &quot; His phrasing skirted the fact that the United States , with its veto in the Security_Council , could have stopped any peacekeeping operation it did not like . Since then , U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright has tried to scale_down and even prevent some peacekeeping missions -- even when they are supported by traditional U.S. allies Britain and France . Under U.S. pressure , for example , the Security_Council authorized 3 # 300 extra peacekeepers for the &quot; safe areas &quot; of Bosnia in March rather than the 10 # 000 requested by Secretary_General Boutros-Ghali . The siege of Gorazde soon underscored the desperate need for more peacekeepers , and the United States gave_in a month later and voted with the rest of the council to approve the other troops . The Clinton_Administration ' s hesitation has also weakened the United Nations ' campaign to speed_up the time it takes_to start a mission . For a year , Col . Gerard Gambiez of France , on special assignment for the United Nations , has led a task_force trying to persuade governments to set_aside trained units that the secretary_general could call_up when he needed to assemble a peacekeeping force . This troubled U.S. officials at first . &quot; My American friends think I am talking_about a standing_army , which is not the case , &quot; Gambiez said recently . What his task_force wanted , he said , was for governments to designate trained troops that could be called_up when the Security_Council authorized a mission . Despite the commitments , governments could still refuse to dispatch the troops if the proposed mission troubled them . Moreover , knowing the Clinton_Administration ' s reluctance to send U.S. soldiers into peacekeeping missions , Gambiez asked the United States to commit resources such_as transport and communications rather than soldiers . &quot; We don ' t need paratroopers , &quot; Gambiez said . &quot; We need things that are much more precious and that are too expensive for other countries to provide . . . . We can play without the United States , but it would be a pity. &quot; At an April 14 meeting with U.N. diplomats , Gambiez announced that 18 countries had signed agreements with the United Nations to designate 28 # 000 troops as standby forces for peacekeeping . In addition , he said that 13 other governments were engaged in serious negotiations that could result in signed agreements for 42 # 000 more troops -- making a total standby force of 70 # 000 , about the same number that are now in the field . The colonel did not identify all_the governments that had signed agreements but later told reporters that France was one . The session produced a sign of cooperation from the Clinton_Administration . Albright ' s deputy , Ambassador Karl F . Inderfurth , told the meeting that the U.S._government welcomed the work of the task_force and would soon provide the United Nations with a detailed &quot; listing of the ( U.S. ) military_capabilities it feels most appropriate for peacekeeping purposes. &quot; But Inderfurth said the Clinton_Administration would not sign any agreement and that the list &quot; in no way implies a commitment to provide these capabilities. &quot; Nevertheless , Gambiez hailed the promise of a list as a breakthrough . &quot; This is exactly what I want , &quot; he told reporters . &quot; This is what I have been waiting for . I want to know what they will make available to us . I do not need a piece_of_paper . They cannot sign for internal political reasons. &quot; A constant refrain comes from Clinton_Administration officials , members of Congress and think_tank analysts when they discuss peacekeeping : that there often is confusion over who is really in_charge . This issue is heightened by the feeling among many outsiders and , in fact , insiders as well , that U.N. bureaucrats are often inept . The command in Bosnia has long been entangled in crossed signals and recriminations -- not surprising in a mission with confused goals . The United Nations has acted both as an impartial referee distributing food to all and as a protector of besieged towns from Serbian aggression . Military decisions have been made by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , U.N. peacekeeping commanders and U.N. bureaucrats . The secretary_general , a professor and diplomat with no military experience , has had final authority to decide when and when not to bomb . This has bruised feelings . In a letter that has never been published by the United Nations , Gen . Jean Cot of France , the former commander of the U.N. Protection Force in the former Yugoslav republics , complained to Boutros-Ghali in January that the duties of the force commander and the secretary_general ' s special representative were &quot; incompatible ' -- a euphemistic way of saying their roles clashed -- and that bureaucrats in New York &quot; have rapidly made me the object of day and night harassment on minor problems. &quot; Cot also said the system for U.N. civilian approval of air support was so cumbersome as_to weaken the credibility of air_power as a deterrent . He requested the authority to order NATO air support on_his_own in case of attacks on the Sarajevo airport , a U.N. military base or any humanitarian operation . But Boutros-Ghali refused and later removed Cot and Lt . Gen . Francis Briquemont of Belgium , who was the commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia , for challenging the authority of the United Nations . The issue erupted again on April 23 when NATO decided to bomb the Bosnian Serbs for defying an ultimatum by continuing to shell Gorazde . The NATO decision was vetoed by Yasushi Akashi of Japan , the secretary_general ' s special representative , who insisted that the Serbs would end their siege that night . In the end , Akashi was proven correct , and many Western governments were probably relieved that there had been no bombing , but Akashi ' s defiance of NATO still irritated many U.S. and European officials .
