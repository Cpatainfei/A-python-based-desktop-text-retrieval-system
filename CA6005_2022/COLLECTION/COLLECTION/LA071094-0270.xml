   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI : GIFTS OF MONEY NOT ALWAYS TAXABLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q . Will you please explain how the gift_tax system works and what its rationale is ? I gave my grandson $ 15 # 000 to buy a car . I consider it a personal_expense , and it was made with after-tax money ; it was not a deduction . So why the gift_tax ? Isn ' t this double taxation ? -- D.C . A . First , let ' s explain what the so-called gift_tax is really all about . Our current tax_system essentially treats the transfer of wealth -- up_to $ 600 # 000 a person -- the same whether the transfer was made during the donor ' s lifetime or posthumously . Taxpayers are permitted to give_away up_to $ 600 # 000 during their lifetimes , or after death , without either the recipient or the donor owing any tax on that transfer . ( Of course , this money has already been subject_to taxation once , for the year it was accumulated. ) Once the $ 600 # 000 limit is crossed , donors are liable for taxes -- you ' re right , this is now double taxation -- on the amount in excess of that maximum . Tax_rates start at 37 % and are graduated up_to 55 % ( on $ 3 million ) . These limits and rates are the same , whether the gift is given during the donor ' s lifetime or not . If a gift comes_after death , the donor ' s estate pays any applicable taxes . Now to your gift . Remember , all taxpayers are allowed to give_away up_to $ 600 # 000 , tax-free , in their lifetimes or at death . In addition , each of us may give any other person up_to $ 10 # 000 a year over and above that limit . Two-thirds of your $ 15 # 000 gift to your grandson -- $ 10 # 000 -- is covered by that annual gift provision . The remaining $ 5 # 000 counts against your $ 600 # 000 lifetime limit . You must file gift_tax Form 709 with your income_tax_return , but you owe no tax on that gift , unless -- and this is unlikely -- you have already given more_than $ 600 # 000 . Once you file Form 709 , the government_notes that your remaining exemption stands at $ 595 # 000 . The same process is followed every time you exceed the annual $ 10 # 000 per-capita limit . Then , at your death , any bequest beyond the remaining limit is subject_to taxation . Deducting Losses on IRA Accounts Q . In a recent column , you said that taxpayers are allowed to deduct losses on after-tax contributions to individual_retirement_accounts . Can you explain the rules governing these deductions ? -- R.A.C . A . The Internal Revenue Service has established strict guidelines governing the deductibility of losses sustained by after-tax IRA investments . It wants to prevent abuses and ensure that Uncle_Sam gets his full share of tax-deferred retirement savings . Under these guidelines , taxpayers must , in_essence but not in reality , aggregate all their IRA investments -- pretax as well as after-tax -- to determine if their IRA withdrawals add_up to less than the total tax basis of all_the accounts . Furthermore , a deduction is not allowed until all_the accounts -- pretax as well as after-tax -- have been fully depleted . Deferring Tax on Land Sale Q . I have 7.5 acres that I want to sell . Must I reinvest my proceeds in more land to avoid a big tax hit ? What are my choices ? C.R . A . To defer taxes on your immediate gain , you may enter into what is known as a Section 1031 , or Starker , exchange . This program , explained in Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code , extends_to investment property the same tax-deferral benefits that homeowners enjoy . The program allows you to roll_over your proceeds into any type of real_estate within a prescribed period_of_time . You would be wise_to consult a real_estate attorney or accountant for professional advice before proceeding with an exchange . Installment Sale : You Pay Now and Later Q . I am thinking_of selling a piece of commercial property I purchased five years ago through a 1031 exchange . I estimate that at the net sales price we are considering , $ 610 # 000 , I will have a gain of about $ 93 # 000 . The sale proposal calls_for the buyer to assume our first-trust deed of $ 375 # 000 and for me to take_back a second deed_of_trust of $ 225 # 000 . The buyer ' s $ 150 # 000 down_payment will go toward reducing the first deed by $ 100 # 000 , to $ 275 # 000 , and closing costs . I will not be realizing any cash out of the sale until the note is paid_off , in three to five years . When do I have to pay taxes on my gain -- now , or when I get the cash from the note ? -- P.M.L . A . This deal is an installment sale . You are liable for taxes now on a portion of the sales proceeds , and you will be responsible later for taxes on the remainder as you receive it . Here ' s how to figure it all out , a process you will re-create when you complete IRS Form 6252 : First , calculate your gross taxable gain by deducting your tax basis , as adjusted by improvements and depreciation , from your net sale price . You say your figure is $ 93 # 000 . Then you must calculate what percentage of the deal this profit represents compared to your initial investment . This is done_by dividing your gain , $ 93 # 000 , by the contract sale price . ( The latter is calculated by subtracting the debt relief of $ 375 # 000 from the net sale price of $ 610 # 000 , yielding $ 235 # 000. ) This gives you a ratio -- or what the IRS calls your &quot; gross_profit percentage &quot; -- of 40 % . To determine how much you owe the government for the year of sale , you apply 40 % to the down_payment of $ 150 # 000 , meaning $ 60 # 000 of the down_payment is a taxable gain and subject_to the maximum 28 % capital_gains tax . The same 40 % of all future repayments of principal will also be subject_to capital_gains tax . The remainder is considered a return of your investment and is not taxable . Of course , any interest payments you receive on the second trust_deed are all taxable .</TEXT>
