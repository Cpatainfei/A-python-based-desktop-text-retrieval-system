   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; HAS IMMIGRATION COLLIDED WITH THE WELFARE_STATE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration seeks to pay_for welfare reform by , among other things , cutting_off Medicaid and Supplemental Social_Security Income to legal immigrants who are not yet citizens . Gov . Pete Wilson wants to free California taxpayers of the financial burden of providing public_services , especially education and emergency health_care , to people who are in the state illegally . Last week , Wilson took an uncontroversial step toward his goal : He sued the federal_government to force it to pay_for maintaining illegal immigrants in California ' s prisons . That an activist Democrat and a moderate Republican would take , or plan to take , such drastic actions should give pause to those who trace all anxieties about immigrants to nativism or racism . Proposals to limit , or deny public_services or benefits to immigrants -- legal or illegal -- also remind us that the problem with immigration is not exclusively economic . Indeed , in purely economic terms , the current influx of immigrants has been , on balance , a net plus . But America is not just an economy . It is also a political community , whose attention is now turned inward toward pressing domestic problems . The Clinton_Administration obviously feels that domestic needs require renewed commitment to various social investments , and its investment approach highlights the fundamental contradiction between mass immigration and the modern welfare_state . For , as we focus_on investing more in our people , we are compelled to scrutinize exactly who &quot; our people &quot; are . In other words , if a modern nation fails to draw meaningful geographic boundaries around itself , it will feel increasing pressure to draw internal demographic and political lines . During the decade ending in 1992 , approximately 8.9 million immigrants were granted permanent residence . If the 3.2 million illegal immigrants believed to be living_in the United States are added , the total number of newcomers arriving between 1983 to 1992 exceeds the previous record of 10.1 million between 1905 and 1914 . Without a doubt , this peak will be surpassed in the 1990s . And while immigrants today represent a much smaller proportion of the nation ' s population than they did during the first decades of the 20th Century , this is still an enormous number of new residents . There is nothing new about defining and defending our national boundaries and deciding who is and who isn ' t a member of the national community . Apart from being the sovereign right of nation-states , such efforts are a virtual necessity . So how has the United States come_to neglect -- or , perhaps , avoid -- the task of defining its political community ? During the booming 1980s , the demand for immigrant labor , on the one hand , and steadily increasing tax_revenues , on the other , obviated any such technicalities . More generally , since the 1960s an obsessive tolerance has come_to permeate all discussions in which distinctions among groups must be drawn . Certainly among the enlightened , there is a strong tendency to view any mention of border enforcement with some suspicion , on the ground that it is probably motivated by racial fears or bigotry . More recently , the momentum to create trading blocs here and in Europe has fostered the idea that the free ( or at least freer ) movement of goods across national boundaries implies the free movement of people . But people are not the same as goods . This distinction is important in today ' s liberal democracies , because , unlike goods , people have gained many social and political rights -- even when they are non-citizens . Asked to describe his country ' s unanticipated problems managing so-called guest workers , one Swiss official said : &quot; We asked_for workers , and we got people instead. &quot; One point is clear : People still do not flow as easily across borders as goods . Even in the European Community , where both people and goods flow more freely than ever , attention is focused_on the periphery , where the advanced economies of Western Europe confront immigration pressures from their less economically advanced neighbors . Immigration also poses an internal challenge to the modern welfare_state , even its modest American variant . Obviously , the distribution of welfare-state benefits is based not just on equity . Political clout is also involved . And political clout is one thing that immigrants lack . Likely to be more concerned with economic than political advancement , they tend to be handicapped in the interest-group competition that dominates this welfare_state . Today , the preferred solution to this political challenge is to kick the problem upstairs to Washington , as Wilson is seeking to do . Yet , this solution is not going_to work as neatly as hoped . To be sure , the fiscal constraints on local and state_governments complaining about the impact of legal -- and especially illegal -- immigration are greater than those on the federal_government . But not only are there fiscal limits in Washington ; there are also political constraints . Despite the growing presence and visibility of immigrant advocates and their allies in the national arena , the real political clout of immigrant interests is still easily diluted and isolated in Washington . Another troublesome dynamic hard to ignore in Washington is the competition between immigrants and disadvantaged citizens , especially black Americans . How can we justify denying benefits to citizens suffering the accumulated ravages of generations of economic privation and discrimination in favor of the claims of recently arrived , albeit legal , immigrants ? There are no easy answers to such questions . Certainly , the frequently heard response is that disadvantaged Americans and immigrants are not in a zero-sum competition , though this is unconvincing . The courts are hardly an arena in which to resolve these political contradictions . Indeed , it is because of , not in spite of , the courts ' largess to illegal as well as legal immigrants that we are facing a public reaction to the burdens posed by these newcomers . The courts ( need it still be said ? ) cannot go_on indefinitely ignoring political realities . And even if tensions over , for example , the costs of educating illegal immigrant children imposed by the Supreme Court ' s 1982 Plyler vs . Doe decision are moderated , a basic question remains : How shall we achieve fairness in apportioning scarce resources between immigrants and disadvantaged citizens ? Some conservatives have long understood that there is a contradiction between mass immigration and the welfare_state . Indeed , an important reason why conservatives support mass immigration is the expectation that it will speed the collapse of the welfare_state . For their part , liberals have long told themselves that these challenges are illusory . They are deceiving themselves . In any event , the American welfare_state will not collapse . Immigration will weaken it , but not fatally . Immigrants will continue to arrive in America , not only with bundles of belongings but also with bundles of rights . The tough questions will persist -- and fester . We already know how hard and unpleasant it is to draw_a_line between illegal immigrants and the rest of the population . Adopting the Clinton proposal would force us to draw another line , between individuals residing here legally and American citizens . That , too , looks_to be a nasty and divisive business . Perhaps , as we encounter the political and practical difficulties of carrying_out such policies , we will conclude that it would be easier , not to mention wiser and more humane , to address these questions before millions of newcomers -- legal as well as illegal -- put_down roots and gain a stake in our social and political system. *</TEXT>
