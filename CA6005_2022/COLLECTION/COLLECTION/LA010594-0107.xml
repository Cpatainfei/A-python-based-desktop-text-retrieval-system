   <HEADLINE> NEW AIDS ADS EXPLICITLY URGE USE OF CONDOMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal health officials unveiled a new and potentially controversial television and radio AIDS-education campaign Tuesday that for the first time explicitly promotes condom use to reduce the risk of AIDS transmission . The public_service announcements , aimed at young people from 18 to 25 , are much franker than previous government-sponsored ads , which have only hinted at condom use and were widely ridiculed as naive and simplistic . In the dozen years since the epidemic began , an intense national debate has arisen over how best to educate the public about ways to prevent transmission of the human_immunodeficiency_virus ( HIV ) that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome . Chief among the issues is whether information must be graphic to be effective and whether recommending the use of condoms would send an implicit message sanctioning sexual_activity , especially among young people . AIDS-policy and grass-roots service organizations have long argued that only explicit material could get the critical information across . Conservative groups and the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George_Bush believed , however , that the government should only sponsor messages stressing sexual abstinence . &quot; What we have lacked until now is the political will , because we have been too timid to talk openly about the prevention tools at our disposal , &quot; said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala , who introduced the campaign at a press_conference with Kristine M . Gebbie , the Administration ' s AIDS policy coordinator , and Dr. David Satcher , director of the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention . One TV ad , for example , shows the silhouette of a couple about to engage in sex . The camera pulls_away from the bed to a chest of drawers where a condom suddenly emerges . It jumps to the floor , moves across the room and scurries up the side of the bed . A voice then says : &quot; It would be nice if latex condoms were automatic . But since they ' re not , using them should be. &quot; Another features a man and woman kissing and giggling . She asks : &quot; Did you bring it ? &quot; He replies : &quot; Uh-oh . I forgot it. &quot; She responds : &quot; Then , forget it. &quot; A voice says : &quot; Next time don ' t forget it , and every time make_it part of the relationship . A latex condom , used consistently and correctly , prevents the spread of HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , and may save your life. &quot; While the ads do not actually show how to use a condom , they go_further than earlier federally sponsored spots -- among them one ad that met with widespread derision for suggesting condom use by showing a young_man carefully pulling a sock over his foot . &quot; We ' ve gone beyond the sock , &quot; Gebbie said . Shalala said that the major broadcast and cable networks had pledged to air the ads . ABC-TV had been scheduled to show one of them Tuesday night in prime_time . A department official said that the broadcast time was donated -- the spots are public_service announcements -- and the ads cost &quot; less than $ 1 million &quot; to produce . Although conservative groups have expressed some concern about the ads , the campaign has generally been praised by most AIDS organizations and medical groups , including the mainstream American Medical Assn. , religious and community-based organizations . &quot; Explicit messages , including advice on condom use , are appropriate in prevention material , &quot; said Dr. M . Roy Schwarz , the AMA ' s senior_vice_president for medical education and science . &quot; The AMA encourages broadcasters and health educators to embrace this campaign and those who are sexually active to heed its message. &quot; Dan Bross , executive_director of AIDS Action Council , called the ads &quot; a significant break from the past &quot; and said that he hopes the campaign marks a &quot; fresh_start &quot; for the federally sponsored AIDS prevention program . But Gary Bauer , a White_House domestic policy aide during the Reagan_Administration and now head of the conservative Family Research Council , questioned the Administration ' s motives for pushing the new approach . &quot; Is there an American who tunes into prime-time TV who hasn ' t already gotten the message about condoms ? &quot; he said . &quot; I think there is another political agenda here . I think it is more about pushing the envelope on explicitness of sexual matters during prime-time TV than concern about the disease . &quot; I would urge the CDC to have the courage to be creative in telling Americans that abstinence outside of marriage is the best way to prevent transmission. &quot; The general secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops / U.S. Catholic Conference decried the ad_campaign as &quot; promoting a dangerous myth. &quot; &quot; The advertisements promote promiscuity and a false sense of security , which put at risk the very lives of those most likely to be influenced by them , &quot; Msgr . Robert N . Lynch said in a statement . &quot; It is irresponsible to present condoms as the answer to the AIDS threat or to suggest that they are a sure safeguard against HIV transmission . . . . Neither is true. &quot; Lynch said that the public would best be served &quot; by a campaign promoting a responsible attitude toward sexuality as the most serious of human interactions , not a casual recreation. &quot; While some of the ads do urge young people to abstain_from sex , they also recommend that those who are sexually active use latex condoms . &quot; Young people need to know that the surest way to prevent AIDS is to refrain_from having_sex , but we also need to be realistic , &quot; Shalala said . She cited CDC figures showing that 86 % of young_men and 77 % of young_women reported having engaged in sexual_intercourse by the time they reached 20 . Furthermore , of the 12 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases annually , two-thirds occur in people younger than 25 , said CDC Director Satcher . &quot; These numbers cause great concern because the behaviors that put people at risk for ( sexually transmitted diseases ) are the same behaviors that put them at risk for HIV , &quot; he said . Dr. James W . Curran , CDC ' s associate director for HIV / AIDS , said that a recent study of couples where one partner was infected and the other was not showed not a single case of infection after two years among 123 couples &quot; who used latex condoms correctly and consistently. &quot;</TEXT>
