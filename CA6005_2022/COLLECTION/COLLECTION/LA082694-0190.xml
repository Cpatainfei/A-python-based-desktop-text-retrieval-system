   <TEXT> The big news on the Valley fashion front is that grunge -- a sloppy look few parents ever went_for -- is fading into the summer sunset , making pol ished looks more popular . For fall , girls ' fashions are decidedly more ingenue . Feminine preppy-girl chic is edging out flower-child whimsy . For young_men , outrageously oversized styles are being overtaken by a sophisticated , pulled-together look moms and dads are sure to prefer . &quot; Grunge is over , &quot; agrees Jacqueline Kidd , owner of The Baby Cottage in Woodland Hills . Kidd says the biggest trend for fall is the influx of plaid , for both boys and girls . For boys , she is seeing a tremendous number of woodsy plaid T-shirts a la &quot; Northern Exposure. &quot; The guys will pair these with loose-fitting , pleated corduroys . At a la popcorn in Woodland Hills , boutique owner Alissa Cohen sees the combination of plaid schoolgirl skirt and fitted , &quot; baby , &quot; T-shirt as a virtual uniform for fall . The shoe of choice to complete the look : French army boots in dark suedes . This trendy footwear is even available in infant sizes at Cohen ' s next-door shop , which is called L.A. Babes . Though brand names are less important in the ' 90s than they were in the ' 80s , Kidd ' s store does carry a_few some parents and kids like : Baby Guess ? , Guess ? Kids , Petiza and Wollypogs . Cohen , who agrees that label consciousness is waning , says many of her sources -- such_as C.W. Designs -- hail from the San Fernando Valley . Value-priced items , not names , are what drive the sales in her boutique , Cohen says . Parents can expect to pay about $ 70 for a basic two-piece outfit at The Baby Cottage , while prices at a la popcorn can run from $ 50 for a preteen outfit to between $ 40 and $ 75 for a two-piece outfit for younger_girls and boys . In addition to the plaid fad , jumpers are the most happening trend in girls ' wear , says Kidd . Most of the ones displayed in Valley boutiques like Kidd ' s are made of cotton_flannel , as opposed to warmer wool styles being shown in the national fashion magazines . Some feature same-fabric suspenders , while others are equipped with detachable leather or vinyl straps . Often the jumpers are paired with crisp white blouses , tiny T-shirts , thigh-high or knee-high socks and sensible shoes . Cohen says that , at her store , colored denim jeans will continue to be a hot item for both boys and girls . Earthy , subdued tones such_as cream and wheat , she adds , are especially popular in early fall when persistent , summerlike temperatures make dark , heat-absorbing colors less practical . Eight-year-old Shauna Shelton of North Hollywood is readying her list of back-to-school must-haves , says her mother , Laura Leimseider . Shauna , who selects all her own apparel while shopping with her mother , will be looking_for overall jumpers , oversized shorts and long T-shirts . Leimseider reports that she and her daughter typically shop department_stores such_as the Broadway , Robinsons-May and Mervyn ' s for Shauna ' s clothes . Shauna , Leimseider says , places a great_deal of importance on style but is still developing her own personal look . &quot; She ' s picky , &quot; says Mom . &quot; She won ' t wear anything I pick_out . She sometimes doesn ' t wear what she picks out. &quot; One thing Leimseider has determined : If it ' s boyish , Shauna usually likes it . Not all kids bow to the trends when it comes_to shopping for back-to-school items . For example , 14-year-old Josh Fradis , who will attend Chatsworth High this year , says temperature is the driving factor for his back-to-school purchases . Josh -- who prefers to shop with his mother because , as he puts it , &quot; she pays when she comes_along , otherwise I pay &quot; -- plans to get new shorts with his favorite Anchor Blue label . Though he doesn ' t go_in for what he calls the really &quot; huge &quot; look , he does have a strategy when it comes_to fit . &quot; I like to buy everything two sizes bigger , &quot; he says , &quot; because it ' s all more comfortable that way. &quot; Josh also hopes to round_out his wardrobe with some shirts from Billabong , a line of surfing sportswear . As for the more tailored , preppy look , Josh says that while some of his friends are wearing the classic styles , they aren ' t for him . Parents of children who do favor them , however , says Kidd , are sure to applaud the end of long-heated arguments about too-tight or too-loose clothing . &quot; There will probably be more agreement among parents and kids , &quot; she predicts . &quot; The trendy clothes will be the ones parents want to see their children wearing , and that ' s a welcome change. &quot;</TEXT>
