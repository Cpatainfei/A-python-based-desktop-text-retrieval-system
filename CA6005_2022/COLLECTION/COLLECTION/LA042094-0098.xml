   <HEADLINE> MICROSOFT OFFERS A GOLD STAR FOR COPYING ITS LOOK ; COMPUTERS : SOFTWARE GIANT WILL GIVE A ' SEAL OF APPROVAL ' TO PRODUCTS THAT COMPLEMENT ITS OFFICE SUITE OF APPLICATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the latest example of its unabashed aggressiveness , Microsoft Corp . plans to give a special marketing seal_of_approval to software_products that adopt the same look and feel as the company ' s own suite of applications . Given Microsoft ' s dominance of personal computing software , many software developers doubtless will conform_to Microsoft ' s specifications . But makers of competing word-processing and other applications will find themselves under further pressure as users opt_for programs that integrate well with popular Microsoft products . The move by Microsoft to strengthen its hold_on the software market comes even as the company is the subject of a Justice_Department antitrust investigation into claims that it has used its dominant role in personal_computer software to quash competition . Under the program , which is to be unveiled next week , software_products that follow specifications designed to make them work well with Microsoft ' s Office software suite will be permitted to carry the logo Microsoft Office Compatible . Excluded from the program will be products that compete with key Microsoft applications , such_as word_processing and spreadsheets . &quot; Getting the pieces to work together is the key , &quot; said Judy Chase , product manager of Microsoft Office . She said recent Microsoft studies have shown that consumers place more importance on integration and consistency among applications than on new features . The program will strengthen Microsoft ' s position in the rapidly growing market for software suites , which are sets of applications that work well together and sell for a discount . &quot; This strengthens their hand in a very important segment of the market , &quot; said Chuck Stegman , group director for software at the computer research firm Dataquest Inc. &quot; If you are a world leader , the strategy is to get third_parties to fill_in holes in your product line. &quot; Microsoft grabbed 90 % of the $ 844-million market for personal_computer software suites last year , according to Dataquest . The company has sold 1 million copies of an upgraded version of Office since its release in November . The suites have helped sell word-processing and spreadsheet products that might have lost out_in one-on-one combat to products such_as Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect . But some critics worry that the polarization of software applications into two or three major camps , such_as the Microsoft or Lotus suites , could slow innovation by restricting the flexibility of developers . Chase counters that the new program merely sets basic standards at the level of the interface with users and encourages developers to be innovative in other areas . Calera Recognition Systems of Sunnyvale , Calif. , for example , will soon offer a version of its Wordscan optical character-recognition program customized to work with Microsoft Office . Since it uses many of the same commands and menus , new users can use the program without having to learn a lot of complex new commands . Software vendors benefit by getting a chance to take_advantage of Microsoft ' s substantial marketing muscle . Next fall , Microsoft will distribute compact_discs that include demonstrations of compatible applications to each buyer of Microsoft Office . At the huge Comdex computer trade show , Microsoft will offer booths to the 25 software vendors that expect to display Office-compatible applications at the show . In a talk in Anaheim on Tuesday , Microsoft Corp . Chairman Bill Gates announced that the next-generation version of the company ' s hugely popular Windows software will include some form of built-in access to the Internet computer_network . Gates said the Chicago version of the Windows operating system , due out by year-end , will include a single information manager interface that will allow users to scan their electronic_mail or voice mail messages , access faxed documents and connect to the Internet and other on-line systems . Microsoft shares surged $ 5.13 to $ 88.13 on Tuesday in response to earnings , released Monday , that exceeded analysts ' expectations .</TEXT>
