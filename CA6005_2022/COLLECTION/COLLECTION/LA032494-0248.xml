   <HEADLINE> MORE PAPERS ON NIXON ' S CAREER WILL GO_ON VIEW ; RESEARCH : DOCUMENTS AT PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY CONCERN HIS EARLY DAYS IN POLITICS AND THE NON-PRESIDENTIAL YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thousands of long-awaited documents related to former President Richard Nixon ' s early political career and his non-presidential years will become available today for researchers and scholars at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace . The records , some of which date_back 50 years , provide more detail about Nixon ' s public life , including his famous &quot; Checkers &quot; speech and the espionage probe of State_Department official Alger Hiss that launched the young California congressman out of obscurity in the late 1940s . &quot; This is an historic occasion for us , &quot; library director John H . Taylor said Wednesday . &quot; We have been a museum for the President and a policy forum to discuss problems and issues . Now we are offering research capabilities . It is that third pillar of the library we are recognizing. &quot; The collection , unveiled Wednesday during a preview for the news media , contains 19 # 000 photographs , 1 # 600 books , 130 films , 900 audiotapes of Nixon ' s speeches , and documents that occupy 2 # 100 feet of shelf space . * Among the records are correspondence with world leaders . There are notes from Nixon ' s extensive travels abroad , campaign material and other personal papers that span his years as a congressman , senator and vice_president , as well as his post-presidential activities . There are letters Nixon wrote to his Whittier law_firm as a Navy officer during World_War_II , a set of texts from his alma_mater , Whittier College , and original manuscripts of the books he has written since resigning from the presidency in 1974 . &quot; The President is everywhere in this collection , &quot; said Susan Naulty , the library archivist . &quot; He is editing , creating and directing with his fountain_pen . You can see his thought development and how he conducted business. &quot; Naulty said , however , that the collection contains no startling revelations about Nixon ' s public life , except that the thousands of records should provide a substantial number of answers to questions about his political career . Laid out_in detail are Nixon ' s campaigns against Helen Gahagan Douglas for U.S. Senate in 1950 . His unsuccessful 1962 California gubernatorial campaign is there , as well as his campaigns with Dwight D . Eisenhower , and the presidential contest with John F . Kennedy in 1960 . While on the ticket as Eisenhower ' s running mate , Nixon gave his famous &quot; Checkers &quot; speech to deny allegations that he was the beneficiary of an $ 18 # 000 fund set_up by a wealthy businessman . He said he had received a gift after being nominated for vice_president , a black_and_white cocker_spaniel that his daughter had named Checkers . The collection includes published news_reports that prompted the speech . Nixon ' s observations and warnings about communism are reflected in notes he took as a member of the Herter Committee that toured Europe after World_War_II to see if the Marshall Plan should be adopted . * Some of those concerns are embodied in his papers and correspondence related to his work for the House Committee on Un-American Activities , which investigated suspected subversion in the U.S._government at the start of the Cold_War . While serving with the committee , Nixon led the investigation of Alger Hiss , a State_Department official who was accused of being a Soviet spy . Hiss , who was turned_into a symbol of Communist infiltration in the U.S._government , was ultimately convicted of perjury , not espionage . What emerges from the thousands of documents is a portrait of Nixon as an &quot; extremely attentive and meticulous person , &quot; Naulty said . &quot; There is a freshness to it and a confirmation of the fact that Nixon was extremely dedicated , worked hard and sacrificed substantially. &quot; Still missing from the subject-title catalogue is the Watergate scandal that led to Nixon ' s downfall in 1974 . Two years before a Marine helicopter shuttled Nixon from the White_House into private life , Congress seized about 44 million pages of presidential papers and 4 # 000 hours of tapes to preserve them for the Watergate investigation . The National Archives now stores them at the University of Maryland . Of the current collection at the Nixon library , about a 16th , some 4 # 000 to 5 # 000 records , has been sorted and organized for firsthand viewing by scholars and researchers . The slow , painstaking process has taken about 2 1 / 2 years and is far from finished . Although the bulk of the documents have yet to be catalogued , Naulty said , the information they contain is still available upon request to scholars , authors , journalists and academics . Archive administrators will start taking requests for access to the collection today . So far , library officials say , about 20 people , mostly scholars , have applied for access to the collection . Their names were not disclosed . The opening of the archives is the second major development in about a year at the $ 21-million facility , which includes the simple wooden farmhouse Nixon ' s father built from a kit . Last year , library officials announced plans for a new policy center , The Center for Peace and Freedom , which will operate out of Yorba Linda and Washington .</TEXT>
