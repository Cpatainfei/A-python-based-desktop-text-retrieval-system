   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; YIELDS RISE WORLDWIDE ; STOCKS OFF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Worrisome economic news and surprise interest_rate hikes by Sweden and Italy sent bond yields surging worldwide Thursday , knocking stocks lower . The worst damage occurred in Europe , where German bonds , for example , suffered their biggest one-day price drop of the year . Broad stock indexes across Europe dropped 1 % or more . In the U.S. market , the Dow Jones industrial average lost 15.86 points to 3 # 750.90 , fighting_back from heavier losses early in the day . European markets were riled by news that Sweden ' s central_bank raised its key lending rate for banks to 8 % from 7.5 % , the first increase in nearly two years . Later in the day , the Italian central_bank also boosted short-term rates , hiking its &quot; discount &quot; rate to 7.5 % from 7 % . Authorities at the two central_banks said they were responding to concerns that inflation may begin to rise if the economic recovery in Europe continues to build . Urban Baeckstrom , governor of the Swedish central_bank , the Riksbank , said it was moving at &quot; an early stage to counter a tendency to increased inflation. &quot; In Italy , analysts said the central_bank ' s rate boost was in part to defend the weak lira -- raising the potential for a repeat of the market explosion in Europe in the fall of 1992 , when central_banks competed to defend their currencies with higher interest_rates . That episode ended with the effective destruction of the so-called European Exchange_Rate Mechanism that was designed to link currencies ' values . On Thursday , the Swedish and Italian rate hikes caught investors by surprise and sparked a selloff in European bond markets . In Germany , the yield on the benchmark 10-year government_bond soared to 7.22 % from 7 % on Wednesday . In Britain , the yield on 15-year government_bonds zoomed to 8.63 % from 8.48 % . Bond yields had been easing across Europe in recent weeks , but Thursday ' s action suggested that the decline has run its course , economists said . In the U.S. bond market , yields were buffeted by Europe ' s turmoil and by news of higher-than-expected wholesale inflation in July . The Labor_Department said the producer_price_index shot_up 0.5 % in July , the biggest increase in 15 months . Even though the &quot; core &quot; inflation_rate , which excludes energy and food prices , was up only 0.1 % , investors weren ' t mollified . Also weighing_on the market were upward revisions by the Commerce_Department in its May and June retail sales figures , indicating healthy demand and making July ' s slight 0.1 % decline in retail sales seem insignificant . With those reports for a backdrop , the Treasury concluded its quarterly refinancing Thursday , selling $ 11 billion in new 30-year bonds and paying an average yield of 7.56 % on them , above traders ' expectations . The yield on existing 30-year T-bonds , meanwhile , jumped to 7.65 % from 7.57 % on Wednesday . Yields on most shorter-term Treasury securities also rose . The bond market faces another potential jolt today , when the government reports on July consumer price inflation . One casualty of the rise in European rates Thursday was the dollar , which sank as short-term &quot; cash &quot; investments in Europe became even more attractive compared to U.S. securities . The dollar tumbled to 1.561 German marks , down from 1.584 on Wednesday , and to 100.23 Japanese yen from 101.35. On Wall_Street , analysts said they were somewhat surprised that U.S. stocks didn ' t fare worse . Losers topped winners by 13 to 7 on the Big Board , but broad stock indexes lost little ground . Some analysts said investors may have already accepted that the Federal_Reserve_Board is likely to raise short-term rates again when it meets next week . The hikes in Swedish and Italian rates could help force the Fed ' s hand if the dollar continues to weaken . Among Thursday ' s highlights : * Losses were heavy in most European stock_markets . London ' s FTSE-100 index tumbled 28.8 points to 3 # 138.2 , while in Paris the CAC index sank 25.24 points to 2 # 038.93. In Stockholm , the SX-16 index plunged 2.2 % , while Milan ' s Mibtel index fell 1.1 % . Frankfurt ' s DAX index , however , eased just 5.09 points to 2 # 155.28. In Tokyo , the Nikkei 225-share average gained 51.11 points to 20 # 821.36 , and Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index rose 22.22 points to 2 # 596.89. * U.S. industrial stocks were mostly lower . Alcoa lost 5 / 8 to 78 1 / 8 , Exxon fell 7 / 8 to 58 1 / 8 , International Paper dropped 7 / 8 to 74 1 / 8 and Caterpillar was off 1 1 / 2 to 103 . * Many technology stocks , however , continued to rally . Intel rose 5 / 8 to 60 3 / 8 , Microsoft gained 1 1 / 8 to 55 1 / 4 and Computer_Sciences surged 7 / 8 to 41 7 / 8 . * Southland cosmetics firm Neutrogena soared 4 7 / 8 to 26 1 / 2 after saying Wednesday that it is in talks to be acquired .</TEXT>
