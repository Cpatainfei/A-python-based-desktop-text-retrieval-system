   <HEADLINE> BOOKS TO GO : BEHIND THE SCENES AT KENNEDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> THE AIRPORT ; TERMINAL NIGHTS AND RUNAWAY DAYS AT JOHN F . KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL by James Kaplan ( William Morrow &amp; Co. , $ 23 hardcover ) . Most of us use them , sometimes almost daily . Most of us complain about them , but also , in some unlikely way , trust them implicitly . Most of us have no idea what goes_on behind the scenes in one . James Kaplan does . The subject is airports and Kaplan , a well-known magazine writer , has chosen one of the world ' s largest and most complex as the focus of his book . He talks to cab drivers , customs agents , pilots , flight_attendants , airport medics and cops and chaplains , and more . He offers anecdote and history , and writes plainly about crashes and crime . He leaves the reader both unsettled and impressed by the complexity and unpredictability of the airport ' s daily operation . This may_not be the best book for airborne reading , but it ' s one that any frequent flyer ought to read . DO ' S AND TABOOS OF PREPARING FOR YOUR TRIP ABROAD by Roger E . Axtell and John P . Healy ( Wiley , $ 10.95 paper ) and TRAVELING INCOGNITO ; THE INDEPENDENT TRAVELER ' S GUIDE TO THE WORLD by Sarah Shockley ( Any Road Press , $ 14.95 paper ) . Here are two books aimed at what might be called the timid traveler . Both offer packing checklists , suggestions on how to plan itineraries , notes on health and safety and the_like . Both dispense advice on changing money , choosing hotels and restaurants and dealing with that pesky language_barrier . At least a_couple_of volumes of this sort seem to come_out every year . They ' re always well-intentioned ; they ' re always written by experienced travelers who aim to share the fruits of their experience ; they always contain at least some useful counsel . But they ' re also usually padded with so_much self-evident fluff that they end_up seeming condescending -- as do these two . Does anybody need to buy &quot; Do ' s and Taboos &quot; for such pearls of wisdom as &quot; When making airline reservations , try to obtain a pre-assigned seat &quot; or &quot; Hotels exist in many sizes and classes of service &quot; ? Most of what the novice traveler needs to know for most destinations would fit into a magazine_article ; so would most of the genuine service in these books . Quick trips : AROUND THE WORLD IN 18 HOLES by Tom Callahan and Dave Kindred ( Doubleday , $ 23 hardcover ) . A golf-loving traveler ' s fantasy manual -- the account of a 37 # 000-mile jaunt undertaken by two sportswriters for the express purpose of playing 18 holes of golf on courses in 21 countries , on four continents . The authors ' tone is ( appropriately ) breezy , and their adventures , on and off the links , from Iceland to Nepal , Sun City to Ft . Worth , will amuse even the non-golfer . THE HEART OF THE SKY ; TRAVELS AMONG THE MAYA by Peter Canby ( Kodansha International , $ 13 paper ) . Since this book first appeared in hardcover two years ago , notes the author in a new preface , &quot; Things have changed dramatically for the Chiapas Mayas. &quot; He helps explain who they are , and why dramatic change was inevitable in this well-written account of his travels through Mexico ' s Chiapas Highlands , a tale well-spiced with history and cultural lore . Books to Go appears the second and fourth week of every month . For information on more travel books , see L28 .</TEXT>
