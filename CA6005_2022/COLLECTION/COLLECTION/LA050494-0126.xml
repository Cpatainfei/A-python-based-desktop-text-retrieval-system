   <HEADLINE> EXTRADITION SOUGHT FOR 2 SUSPECTS IN SHOTGUN SLAYINGS IN LANCASTER ; CRIME : THEY ARE IN FLORIDA , WHERE THEY FACE MURDER_CHARGES FOR A KILLING LAST WEEK . L . A . AUTHORITIES MAY WAIT UNTIL THE MEN ARE TRIED THERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Extradition proceedings were initiated Tuesday to bring a pair of drifters -- described by police as cold-blooded killers -- from Florida to Los Angeles so they can face trial in the shotgun slayings of two people in Lancaster . Following an intense dragnet by police , Harry Jackson Boyd and Terry Tyrone Evans were arrested in St . Lucie , Fla. , where they are accused of beating and stomping a popular local handyman to death , authorities said Tuesday . Even though the extradition proceedings were launched , Los Angeles authorities said they will probably wait until the men are tried in the Florida case before bringing them back to California . Boyd and Evans were arrested Saturday evening , four days after they allegedly killed Robert Lee Williams in a vacant_lot next to a grocery_store , according to Mark Weinberg , a spokesman for the St . Lucie County Sheriff ' s Department . Williams , 44 , made an insulting remark to a woman who apparently was with Boyd and Evans , spurring them into a violent and deadly rampage , Weinberg said . Several children found Williams ' body lying face down at the scene , and medical_examiners later determined he had died when internal injuries caused his lungs to fill with blood , Weinberg said . &quot; They started with their fists and then stomped him with their feet . And then they left him to die , &quot; Weinberg said . &quot; He died actually by drowning in his own blood. &quot; Weinberg said the slayings have punctured the quiet calm in the small community on the eastern seaboard of South Florida . &quot; Even with some provocation , there was certainly no good reason for these two men to kill Mr. Williams , &quot; Weinberg said . &quot; It was shocking -- to us and to the community. &quot; Boyd , 26 , of St . Louis , and Evans , 18 , of Chicago , were being held without bond at St . Lucie County Correctional Center_on second-degree murder_charges . They were not charged with first-degree murder because authorities believed they did not intend to kill Williams when they started beating him , Weinberg said . When police ran a routine computer check , they found the two were also wanted in connection with a double homicide committed in Los Angeles , apparently after a drug deal went_bad . The two men face charges in the March 1 shotgun slayings of Ronald Greene , 22 , of Upland and Latonya Walker , 23 , of Ontario . Greene was shot once in the back of the head as the four sat in a car outside the Antelope Valley Apartments in the 43400 block of 32nd Street West . He was in the driver ' s seat , and the two suspects were sitting in the back seat , authorities said . Walker fled the vehicle , but Boyd caught her about 15 feet from the car , and Evans walked up and shot her as she begged for her life , authorities said . Evans then dropped the semiautomatic_pistol , and walked to a car driven by a third man , who is still at_large , authorities said . Authorities believe the slayings may have been the result of a &quot; drug-ripoff type of situation , &quot; said Sandi Gibbons , a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office . Greene was in possession of about $ 4 # 500 in cash at the time of the killing , but the suspects apparently searched his body and found no money because it was hidden in his clothing , authorities said . Extradition law entitles Florida to prosecute the two men before they are sent_back to California . Barbara J . Moore , chief in_charge of extradition services for the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office , said whichever jurisdiction has the most serious charges pending against suspects is entitled to try them first . Since both Florida and California authorities want the two suspects on murder_charges , Florida will try them first because they were arrested there , she said . In Florida , the slaying of Williams so enraged local authorities that they put 10 detectives -- a third of the entire St . Lucie detective force -- on a round-the-clock search for his killers , Weinberg said . Boyd and Evans had lived_in Florida more_than 10 years ago , and had returned several weeks ago , Weinberg said . They were identified as suspects through informant tips and other means , placed under surveillance until arrest_warrants could be obtained and then arrested at relatives ' houses as they hid in closets , Weinberg said . &quot; He was a popular person , with no known enemies , &quot; Weinberg said of Williams . &quot; So it was important to us to be able to solve this crime. &quot;</TEXT>
