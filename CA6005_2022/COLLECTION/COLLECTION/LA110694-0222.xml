   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE ; FEINSTEIN , HUFFINGTON SLUGGING OUT FINAL ROUNDS ; INCUMBENT LAUNCHES THREE NEW TV ADS . CHALLENGER APPEARS BEFORE RUSH LIMBAUGH FAN CLUB AND URGES SUPPORTERS TO GET_OUT THE VOTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As America ' s most expensive congressional race in history headed into its final weekend , Sen . Dianne Feinstein and Republican challenger Mike Huffington jabbed at each other Saturday while concentrating_on making_sure their core supporters vote . Feinstein urged_on Democrats in Santa Monica , West Hollywood and Van Nuys . Huffington met with Republican groups in Orange County , San Diego , Palm Springs and Bakersfield . Feinstein launched a blitz on the state ' s television screens , broadcasting three new commercials backed with an advertising budget_for the final week of more_than $ 1.5 million . Still , Huffington ' s unprecedented $ 28-million campaign was expected to continue outspending the incumbent . &quot; We have got_to win this election , &quot; Feinstein told her supporters . &quot; I have won and I have lost elections . I have never felt it was so important , that the integrity of the whole process was more at stake , than it is in this election . That a United States Senate seat could be bought by someone who I am convinced cares not one whit about the people or California would be terrible. &quot; Rep . Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) reminded his troops in San Diego how far they have come . &quot; We were 30 points behind , what they call an unwinnable race , &quot; the candidate said . &quot; Now we are in a statistical dead_heat and we need for you to get_out and vote and to call 10 people you know and get them to vote on Election Day. &quot; In addition to showing that the race is very close , recent polls indicate that Huffington and Feinstein have pounded each other so_much that neither can claim to be liked by even half of the state ' s voters . Political analysts say an unusually large portion of the electorate remains undecided in the Senate_race because they are disgusted with both of their choices . The upshot is that experts believe the winner may well receive less than 50 % of the vote , which has happened only twice in the last 60 years of California U.S. Senate_races -- with Barbara Boxer in 1992 and Alan Cranston in 1986 . As the candidates stumped for votes_in the Southland , both campaign headquarters were also furious with activity . Among the developments Saturday : * Feinstein ' s three new television commercials included one attacking her opponent , another comparing their records of accomplishment in Washington and a third -- only to be shown on cable_television channels -- that highlights the senator ' s endorsement by eight newspapers . One ad attacks Huffington for admitting recently that he violated federal law by employing an illegal immigrant nanny for more_than four years . Feinstein employed a housekeeper from Guatemala for about three years , ending in 1983 . The senator has maintained that she did nothing improper because when the woman was hired she showed documents indicating she was in the country legally . On Friday , officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Service said the housekeeper entered the country legally but her visa only allowed her to work_at the Guatemalan Consulate and even that permission expired while she worked for Feinstein . The senator ' s campaign has said that Feinstein ' s case is different from Huffington ' s employment of an illegal immigrant nanny until last year because a 1986 federal law made such hiring a crime . Huffington has blamed his wife for the hiring decision but conceded that federal immigration and tax laws were broken . Feinstein has shown records demonstrating that she paid taxes and Social_Security on her employee . &quot; Congressman Huffington admits he broke federal immigration law , &quot; the ad says . &quot; Dianne Feinstein broke no federal immigration laws. &quot; * The Republican campaign released a letter Saturday from Sen . Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) asking why the INS is not investigating Huffington ' s charge that a Santa Barbara reporter approached his former nanny and claimed to be a Feinstein campaign operative . The Huffington campaign contends that the reporter , who has denied the allegation , offered the nanny a green_card if she would talk_about her work_at the Huffington household . * Huffington officials also produced a 1988 letter that appeared to be written by Feinstein as she tried to help her former housekeeper , Anabella Piaz , gain permanent residency in the United States . The campaign said the letter indicates Feinstein knew of her housekeeper ' s illegal status because it says , &quot; Anabella ' s immigration status has been somewhat mixed_up during the years. &quot; But Feinstein officials said the letter does not contradict what the senator has said all along , that she believed her housekeeper had permission to be in the country when she was hired . On the campaign trail , Feinstein said , &quot; When I hired this person in 1980 , she submitted to me documentation which I believed was correct . I have broken no laws . Mr. Huffington has . What he is doing . . . is kind of a last-ditch , desperation effort. &quot; * Feinstein ' s campaign released its own letter from a fellow congressman on Saturday in which Sen . Bob Kerrey ( D-Neb. ) complained to Huffington that one of his campaign mailers is misleading . Kerrey charged that a photograph in the mailer of the candidate ' s father wearing a Navy uniform was intended to imply that the candidate is a military veteran even though he has no service record . &quot; This deceit is an insult to every veteran who has served this country , &quot; said Kerrey , who won the Medal_of_Honor as a Navy SEAL_in Vietnam . &quot; For you to imply that you have served in our country ' s military when you did not is shameful. &quot; Huffington ' s day began in Orange County , where the candidate attended a breakfast rally with the fan club of conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh . Huffington told the audience of about 160 people that he favored reduced government regulation , a cut_in capital_gains taxes and increased defense spending . Then he charged that his opponent cast votes_in Congress to benefit her husband ' s business . &quot; Can you imagine a senator voting to enrich themselves ? &quot; he said to a roar of approval . Proposition 187 , the ballot measure that would bar illegal immigrants from public education and non-emergency health_care benefits , was also a popular target for the gathering . Bob Forsberg , chapter president of a Rush Limbaugh fan club , set the tone for the appearance with a joke that referred to Proposition 187 supporters as &quot; low riders. &quot; &quot; There are some people who are against Proposition 187 who are down at the bottom of the road , &quot; Forsberg said . &quot; They would like to come_up here , but the low-riders can ' t get_over the speed bumps. &quot; When Huffington spoke later , he endorsed Forsberg ' s campaign for City_Council in Lake Forest . &quot; ' We have to elect politicians -- whether it is Bob ( Forsberg ) or ( Newport Beach Assemblyman ) Gil Ferguson or anyone else who is running -- who will tell the truth , &quot; Huffington said . Huffington also returned to a favorite theme in recent days -- that the &quot; liberal &quot; media , and the Los Angeles Times in particular , favor Feinstein and are trying to block stories about her employment of the housekeeper . He called the paper ' s coverage of the issue &quot; a cover-up. &quot; &quot; This is what we are up against , the liberal media , &quot; Huffington said . &quot; You know something , thank God for Rush Limbaugh ! This man is telling the truth and thank God someone is willing to stand_up and do it. &quot; Feinstein skipped an appearance Saturday with President Clinton in Oakland as campaign officials decided instead to focus the senator ' s attention on the key battleground of Southern California . Feinstein has already appeared with the president four times during her campaign , including two events in Los Angeles on Friday . Feinstein attended rallies for her supporters in West Hollywood , Santa Monica and the San Fernando Valley . When she accepted a giant greeting card signed by dozens of supporters , Feinstein emotionally thanked the audience . &quot; There is a lot of grief in what I do , &quot; she said , wiping at her eyes . &quot; This is one of the nicest moments I ' ve had in this entire campaign . When you work hard you really don ' t expect that anybody is going_to say , ' Thank you. ' And suddenly when they do , you find that it ' s a very , very emotional experience. &quot; Also contributing to this report was Times staff writer Jim Rainey .</TEXT>
