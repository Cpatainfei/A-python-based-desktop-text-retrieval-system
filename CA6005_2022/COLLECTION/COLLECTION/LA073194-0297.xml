   <HEADLINE> HUBER CASE A CHALLENGE TO DEFEND OR PROSECUTE ; COURTS : CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF SLAYING LOOKS BAD FOR FAMALARO , BUT SOME DETAILS COULD WORK IN HIS FAVOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It seems like a damning case : A long-missing Newport Beach woman turns_up dead , her body nude and handcuffed in a locked freezer stowed away in a rental truck parked in the prime suspect ' s driveway . A search of that suspect ' s home turns_up keys to the handcuffs and the freezer , a box containing the woman ' s clothing and personal effects from her purse , as well as yellowed newspaper_clippings about her disappearance -- even documents proving he rented the truck and bought the freezer . But defense_attorneys and criminal_law authorities caution against assuming that prosecutors will have little difficulty proving John J . Famalaro , 37 , of Dewey , Ariz. , fatally bludgeoned Denise Huber , 23 , then wrapped her corpse in plastic bags and kept her in a freezer for nearly three years . &quot; Just because he has the body doesn ' t prove he did_it . Just because evidence points in one direction doesn ' t mean you can assume the person must be guilty , &quot; said Orange County Deputy Public_Defender Leonard Gumlia , before he unexpectedly became responsible_for Famalaro ' s defense and decided he should avoid further comment . Gumlia is currently embarking_on the most critical aspect of his case , experts say , mapping_out a defense strategy that could run the gamut from self defense to an insanity_plea to arguing that he was threatened by the real killer into keeping the horrible secret in the freezer . As the case stands now , it ' s a classic example of circumstantial_evidence , say Famalaro ' s original attorneys in Arizona and Sacramento Deputy Public_Defender James R . Ramos , who handled a similar case several years ago . Michael Schinkel , dubbed &quot; Freezerman , &quot; was convicted of first-degree murder in Sacramento in November , 1991 , for killing his girlfriend during a heated fight , and carrying her body around in an unplugged freezer for almost five years . &quot; You can take a set of facts that seem to say , ' Hey , this guy is guilty of everything , ' but to find him guilty , you would have make a leap and infer that that means he did_it . But you still have no evidence of that , &quot; said Ramos , whose client admitted to police that he killed the woman when she attacked him during an argument . When jurors are faced with two reasonable interpretations of the facts , and one points to guilt and one points to innocence , jurors are bound by law to acquit the defendant , Ramos said . But Yavapai County Deputy Counsel Thomas B . Lindberg , who was set to prosecute Famalaro in Arizona before he relinquished the case to Orange County prosecutors , said &quot; I completely disagree &quot; with that assessment . He points_out that most murder cases are circumstantial : the key witness -- the victim -- is no longer alive to testify , and there are rarely first-hand , eyewitness accounts of a killing . &quot; I don ' t think you ' ll have a jury that says , ' Oh , you have a body and there ' s all this other evidence , but we ' ll let you go because no one saw you do_it , ' &quot; said Lindberg , adding that the evidence against Famalaro appears greater than in most murder cases . Many who have been following the Huber murder case as it unfolded after Famalaro ' s arrest say a troublesome point for prosecutors may be proving allegations that would make Famalaro eligible for the death_penalty under California law . Orange County prosecutors have filed charges alleging Huber was kidnaped and murdered . California law requires prosecutors to prove the murder took_place during a kidnaping , sexual_assault or in one of several so-called &quot; special circumstances &quot; before a convicted murderer can be sentenced to death . Under Arizona law , prosecutors must only prove a killing was sufficiently &quot; depraved and heinous &quot; before seeking the death_penalty , leading some to speculate it would be more difficult for California authorities to secure a death_penalty conviction . Huber , a 23-year-old UC Irvine graduate who was working as a waitress , was driving_home from a concert in Inglewood in June , 1991 , when a tire on her blue Honda Accord suffered a blowout on the Corona del Mar Freeway . She was never heard from again , but her parents launched a tireless public search for her whereabouts , making Huber ' s name easily recognizable by many Orange County residents . No witnesses have come_forward to testify that Huber was kidnaped or ambushed by her attacker . The final results of an autopsy could lead to additional charges , but decomposition and the frozen condition of the body may forever conceal evidence of any possible sexual_assault , officials said . Huber ' s personal belongings were found in Famalaro ' s garage , but she was not stripped of rings and other jewelry . A savvy defense_attorney could fight a robbery allegation by saying the items were taken_after her death , or were in fact mementos of a macabre sort -- not stolen goods . Law_enforcement officials say their &quot; gut reaction &quot; tells them Huber was too smart to fall_for a stranger ' s ploy in the middle of the night and she must have been abducted or lured from her crippled vehicle by a sophisticated ruse . But they also admit that the gut instincts of even the most experienced detective do not equal convictions . Costa Mesa Police Lt . Ron Smith said the discovery of blood in a Laguna Hills storage facility helps pinpoint the murder scene and indicates that Huber must have been abducted from the freeway . While many criminal attorneys agree it will not be a simple case for prosecutors , they also say the defense has an uphill battle ahead . How can Famalaro explain away a body in his freezer -- which he apparently took pains to keep plugged_in at all times -- if he goes_on trial ? Thomas K . Kelly and Warren Darrow , two Arizona defense_attorneys who until recently were planning to defend Famalaro against Arizona murder_charges , have declined to comment on what their strategy might have been had the case gone_to trial in Yavapai County , where Famalaro was living at the time Huber ' s body was discovered . But legal motions filed_in Yavapai County court late last week indicate they intended to scrutinize the prosecution ' s case at every turn for evidence that police focused only on their client as a suspect -- and may have doctored their notes to help prove their case . It is anticipated that Kelly and Darrow will assist Gumlia as needed . &quot; I really think there are a limitless number of issues here for the defense to seize upon , &quot; said one prominent Orange County defense_attorney . &quot; They could argue that other people had access to the freezer and lived at the home as well . They could try to point the finger at someone else , and ( Famalaro ' s ) brother doesn ' t have_the_best record in this area , &quot; the attorney said . But police say that , barring additional evidence , they have ruled_out Warren Famalaro as a possible suspect . As an Orange County chiropractor , Warren was convicted more_than a decade ago of sexually assaulting a young boy and a teen-age girl , both patients_of his at the time . John Famalaro ' s first defense_attorney , Lawrence W . Katz , seized upon some of these same ideas during a bail hearing . Katz repeatedly questioned Lt . Scott Mascher of the Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Department about whether authorities could prove that Famalaro knew the contents of the freezer . He also questioned how Mascher could be sure Famalaro ' s brother-in-law , Duane Thobe , had taken all his belongings when he moved from the house . Records show the home_in which Famalaro lived is owned by Thobe . Thobe ' s civil attorney in Arizona , Eric Chester , became enraged when a reporter called to ask him about Katz ' s comments . &quot; We will only do our explaining to the authorities , &quot; he said , threatening to sue if any further questions were asked . UCLA law professor Peter Arenella said the bizarre nature of the case could pave the way for an insanity defense -- although he noted that such cases are rarely successful . &quot; It ' s not simply a question . . . that a person did a bad thing , so he is guilty of all_the charges , &quot; Arenella said . &quot; There remains the question of the person ' s mental_state at the time , and that ' s an issue that could lead to an acquittal or a conviction of a less serious charge. &quot; William Thompson , professor of criminology , law and society at UC Irvine , said he expects psychiatric experts will be examining Famalaro before long . Thompson said the prosecution may face difficulty proving premeditation and deliberation -- elements needed for a first-degree murder_conviction -- especially since so_much time has passed . Both sides disagree on how the lapse of time between Huber ' s disappearance and the unsettling use of the freezer and handcuffs will impact the case . Huber ' s mouth and eyes were covered with cotton and sealed shut with duct tape . For the prosecution , those elements can be used to argue premeditation and consciousness of guilt . For the defense , it could help in an insanity defense . Both sides , however , say key evidence that could help their case may have been lost or destroyed over the years . &quot; Is it possible she died accidentally ? It may_not seem plausible , but remember the burden_of_proof is_on the prosecution , and the standard of proof is high , &quot; Thompson said . &quot; One can speculate on any number of defense theories to be advanced . He could argue it was in the heat of passion , after an argument . He could even argue self-defense . He tried to kidnap her , took her back to his place , in her struggle to get_away she came_after him with a knife , and he beat her to save himself . &quot; The prosecution will have to establish both the act and the mental_state for the act , &quot; Thompson said . &quot; At this point , the defense will be looking_at the evidence like it ' s a chain-link fence , and wondering where the weak links are. &quot;</TEXT>
