   <HEADLINE> ' DO AS I SAY ' DOESN ' T CUT IT WITH TEENS ; FAMILY VALUES : ADULT BEHAVIOR AND COMMERCIAL CULTURE MUST CHANGE FIRST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As part of his plan for welfare reform , President Clinton seeks to bring_down the rate of unwed-teen parenthood , a major generator of child poverty and welfare dependency . He plans to replicate successful programs that encourage teen-agers to postpone sex -- and to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to deliver a stern message to teens : Don ' t have_sex until you are older . Don ' t have babies before you are married . This is a challenging task . Clinton deserves credit for attempting it . But to succeed , he must bring his campaign to adults as well . The norms governing teen-age sexuality are not set solely by the teen-agers . Adult conduct and the commercial culture strongly shape adolescent attitudes and behavior . The rise in unwed-teen parenthood is part of a much broader shift in patterns of sex and marriage . No change is more pervasive or dramatic than the increase in illegitimate births among women of all ages . Unwed motherhood has risen by 82 % since 1980 . Nearly one out of three births occurs outside of marriage . Most unwed mothers are over 20 . The biggest rate of increase in unwed childbearing has come among women who probably have the greatest control over their fertility : college-educated women . And the trend toward runaway fatherhood was under way long before this generation of teen-agers reached puberty . One of the classic responsibilities of adults is to set an example for children . An example has been set . Though some persist_in portraying unwed motherhood as social rebellion , the facts tell a different story . More_than half of adult Americans -- including a whopping 70 % of younger adults -- say that a woman should be able to bear a child outside of marriage without reproach . Illegitimacy is now as American as the Fourth_of_July . Closer to home , parents ' sex lives affect the sex lives of their children . Research suggests that children who are persistently exposed to the sex lives of their dating parents are more likely to be sexually active at an early age . Girls who grow_up in single-mother families have_sex earlier than girls who live with both parents . Since young teens are the least likely of all age_groups to engage in protected sex , early sexual initiation increases the risks of early pregnancy and childbearing . More alarmingly , girls who grow_up in single-mother households with a string of drop-in or live-in boyfriends are at a higher risk for sexual abuse and coercive sexual initiation than are girls who grow_up in intact families . Such traumatic sexualization , harmful in itself , is also associated with later sexual risk-taking . Moreover , lack of parental supervision and protection is a key factor_in exposing daughters to the risks of early sex and pregnancy . And grown-ups , not kids , run the advertising , entertainment and alcohol industries that rely so heavily on sex to sell products to the lucrative youth market . In short , teen-age sexuality does not exist in a vacuum . It is part of a larger social ecology that must change if we expect teen-agers to do the right thing . This raises some questions for the President as well as for a society increasingly eager to get_rid_of the welfare system : Can we offer tough talk to kids without a_few cautionary words to the adults ? Can we ask teen-agers to zip_up and hold_back without asking_for some voluntary restraint from those who sell tapes and tickets and T-shirts to them ? Can we ask poor minority teen-agers to marry before they become parents without upholding the same norm for more privileged white adults ?</TEXT>
