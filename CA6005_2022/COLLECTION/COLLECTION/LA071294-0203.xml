   <HEADLINE> DESIGNS ON THE FUTURE ; WITH THE SOUTHLAND A CRUCIAL BATTLEGROUND , CAR_MAKERS ARE ASKING LOCAL STUDIOS TO SHAPE TOMORROW ' S AUTOMOBILES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Charles W . O . Ellwood , an English-born car designer who has spent the bulk of his career in Germany , had an automotive epiphany when he arrived in Southern California last October to take the helm at Volkswagen ' s Simi Valley design studio . American drivers ' fascination with cup holders , he says , suddenly made_sense . &quot; You can ' t drive the speeds we drive_in Europe and use cup holders . It ' s just too dangerous , &quot; says Ellwood , 39 , formerly chief of interior_design at Volkswagen in Wolfsburg , Germany . &quot; But here , you ' re living in the vehicle , you ' re drinking in the vehicle , the kids are moving_back_and_forth . You ' re doing a lot of things other_than driving. &quot; Car_makers have been making similar realizations since they began flocking to the West Coast 20 years ago . From the cup holders that pop_out of dashboards to the sleek coupes pulling_out of driveways , the Southern California influence has been profound . Most designs are still produced in Detroit , Tokyo , Wolfsburg and other motor_cities . But today 16 satellite studios are sprinkled throughout the Southland , including five in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County region . From Camarillo to Valencia , designers in the area are shaping the futures of General Motors , Ford , Volvo , BMW , Volkswagen and Audi . Recently , the five local studios have come_up with an array of designs that have captured worldwide attention , including electric_car designs from Volvo and BMW that are not yet scheduled for production , but may enable those companies to thrive in California as tough new emissions regulations take_hold . The two domestic studios have produced designs -- the 1993 Ford Probe and the 1994 Chevrolet Camaro -- that have resuscitated sports coupe models whose sales had faltered . And Volkswagen ' s update of the classic Beetle has generated so_much excitement among long-despondent Volkswagen faithful that the company , which had been hesitant to revive the model , is talking_of delivering the new Beetle to dealers in 1998 . For all their sparkle , these successes are already distant memories for the studios , where designers are under the gun to divine today what the public will want at the turn_of_the_century . The stakes are monumental . To go from sketches on a page to cars on_the_road can take more_than five years and cost upward of $ 1 billion . And after losing market share to consumer-attentive Japanese auto_manufacturers in the 1980s , American and European car_makers know they cannot afford to neglect a single nuance of a car ' s design . * Thomas V . Peters , head of GM ' s studio in Newbury Park , says flatly : &quot; This is war. &quot; California , then , is a strategic battlefront . The state accounts_for 10 % of new car registrations in the United States each year , and 3 % of new car registrations in the world . To succeed in California , car_makers have decided , it makes_sense to be in California , where the sun splashes off a car ' s finish , revealing the flaws or grace of every curve ; where car-crazy consumers are quick to embrace a fresh design , and quicker to discard a stale one ; and where cultural trends seem to land like drops of water that ripple through the rest of the country . Local studios scour the Southern California landscape for hints of shifting consumer tastes , looking_for cues in everything from computer terminals to athletic shoes . They pore over hundreds of magazines each month , noting emerging clothing styles and advertising strategies . Some have even adopted an academic approach . Volvo ' s Camarillo design center , for example , employs a staff sociologist to track changes in consumer attitudes . &quot; This is a think_tank , &quot; says Sylvia S . Voegele , general_manager at Volvo ' s studio . &quot; When we present a design , we also present who we think it would sell to and why. &quot; Always wary of industrial espionage , the studios guard their ideas zealously , hiding behind smoked-glass windows that are impenetrable to an outsider ' s gaze . Within the studios , work stations lie behind doors with magnetic security locks . Drawings and documents are locked_away or shredded , and employees are required to sign contracts pledging to protect their company ' s secrets . Annual budgets at the studios fall_in the $ 2 million to $ 4 million range , and each center employs about half_a_dozen designers , with total employment ranging from 15 at Volvo to 30 at GM . Four of the five local studios -- Ford , GM , Volkswagen and Volvo -- are satellite operations of , or are under exclusive contracts with , the manufacturers they represent . The exception , Designworks / USA in Newbury Park , works_on products ranging from light-rail cars to garden_tools , in addition to the work the company does for BMW . It was Designworks ' expertise in seat design that caught the German auto_maker ' s attention in the late 1980s , says Charles W . Pelly , president of Designworks . BMW has since purchased 60 % of Designworks ' stock , and now accounts_for a third of the studio ' s business . Studio assignments range from the simple -- a request for a new rim design , for example -- to the seemingly impossible . &quot; Detroit could direct us to explore the youth market and deliver what we think that group will embrace in 1998 , &quot; says Richard J . Hutting , chief_executive at Ford ' s Concept Center California Inc. in Valencia . * But typically , the manufacturer will specify a wheelbase and engine layout , then request a new design or an update of a model already in production . As soon as the order arrives , designers commence sketching , and the weeding_out process begins . Designers compete with other designers within the studio ; studios compete with other studios within the company ; and , finally , companies compete with other companies in the marketplace . Ford ' s studio in Valencia has fared well in these contests . Hastily assembled in 1983 after GM had laid plans for its Newbury Park facility , the Ford studio produced a winner right away -- the 1989 edition Thunderbird . Since then , the studio has had a string of successes , including a major influence on the 1993 Probe . Sales of that year ' s model of the sports coupe surged 42 % from 1992 . But now even Hutting acknowledges that Ford , the domestic design leader since introducing the top-selling Taurus sedan in the mid-1980s , has surrendered the mantle to Chrysler , whose striking new car line was developed at the Chrysler Pacifica studio in Carlsbad . Ford , Hutting says , must search for ways to reassert itself . One of the key challenges will be to anticipate future trends in the minivan and sport utility vehicle markets , segments that barely existed a decade ago , but last year accounted_for 16 % of Ford ' s domestic sales , or 564 # 916 units . Searching for clues to the future of these markets , Hutting and his design team are paying close attention to societal trends , such_as the four-day workweek . If that trend broadens , consumers may use vehicles less for commuting and more for leisure . In the future , Hutting says , customers may want their utility vehicles &quot; more car-like or more truck-like . We have to decide and make a commitment. &quot; GM , meanwhile , must find a way to turn_back the tide . The company has watched its share of car sales in the United States slip from 44 % in 1983 to 32 % last year , and design leadership has shouldered much of the blame . While Ford was turning heads with the Taurus , GM was turning stomachs with the Caprice , a whale of a car that went belly-up on arrival . The company had simply become &quot; out of touch , &quot; says Peters , chief designer at GM ' s Advanced Concepts Center in Newbury Park . &quot; They needed a wake-up call. &quot; Peters and his staff may have helped to provide it . The 1994 Chevrolet Camaro , based largely on an aerodynamic Newbury Park design , has been such an instant hit that analysts are saying GM may start paying increased attention to its sometimes-neglected California studio . U . S . sales of the Camaro and its Pontiac Firebird sibling totaled 76 # 602 during the first five months of 1994 , compared to sales of just 21 # 509 garnered by the previous design during the same period of 1993 . &quot; GM finally gets_it , &quot; says Gordon Wangers , an analyst with Vista-based Automotive Marketing Consultants Inc. &quot; The Camaro could be a car that will turn GM around. &quot; At Volkswagen , similar hopes are being pinned on the Concept One , the working name for a smooth , symmetrical successor to the classic Beetle that was a best-seller for generations of Americans . U . S . Beetle sales peaked at 367 # 607 in 1969 , but Volkswagen sales have fallen_off the charts since 1977 , when the last Beetle was sold in the United States . Last year , amid production problems at the company ' s Mexico plants , U . S . sales dipped below 50 # 000 units , and trade magazines even began reporting rumors of a Volkswagen pullout from the U . S . market . If the Concept One is built -- and Volkswagen has signaled it probably will be -- it can ' t be expected to bring_back 1970s-era market share for the German auto_maker . But Volkswagen spokeswoman Lana Ferrari says that since January , when the Concept One was unveiled at the Detroit auto show , the company has fielded 30 # 000 calls and collected 5 # 000 letters from VW fans urging the company to build the new Beetle . Despite its nostalgic appeal , the Concept One is no replica , says Ellwood , head of Volkswagen ' s Simi Valley studio . The car is capable of being powered electrically -- an important capacity because California law requires that 2 % of all vehicles sold in the state in 1998 be emission-free . Unlike its predecessor , the car also has an up-front engine , front-wheel drive , anti-lock brakes , dual air_bags , and , of course . . . &quot; Cup holders front and rear , &quot; Ellwood says with a chuckle . &quot; We paid particular attention to that. &quot;</TEXT>
