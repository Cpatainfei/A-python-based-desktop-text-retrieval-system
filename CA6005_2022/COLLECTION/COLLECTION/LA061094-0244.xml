   <TEXT> For those getting ready to meet baby , experts recommend the following : * Select and get_to know your pediatrician before the infant arrives . Talk with friends and / or secure some recommendations from the hospital.Make a list of questions and interview potential candidates until you find the one you feel most comfortable with . Find_out how to contact the doctor during non-business hours . * Take the car_seat out of the box and learn how to use it properly . * Take a baby-care class at your local hospital . These classes might seem elementary on the surface , but they can be helpful , even to those who have experience caring for babies . Holding and washing the baby , and caring for the umbilical_cord are just a_few of the topics covered . Hospitals also offer infant CPR classes , a good idea for anyone who plans to be around a new baby . * Get the birth announcements ready . It may_not seem like a taxing job , but the point again is to eliminate stress once the baby arrives . You won ' t know when the baby is going_to arrive , but you know who you are going_to inform once that happens . So address and stamp the envelopes . Once the baby is born , all that ' s left to do is fill_in the name , date , time , height and weight . * Arrange for a helper -- a relative or a hired professional -- and decide in_advance what their responsibilities are going_to be .
