   <HEADLINE> DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT : GETTING FAMILY SUPPORT ; HER OWN KIDS ' NEEDS HELP KAREN MUNROE OF N . TUSTIN KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR SOFTHEAD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A cork bulletin_board in Karen Munroe ' s work studio in her North Tustin home is plastered with sketches of dresses and colorful swatches . Equally colorful alongside them are crayon drawings by two of her four daughters , whose smiling photographs are tacked up there with everything else . Across from the computer , next to a large cutting table that dominates the room , stands a miniature dress form . It ' s not unlike the kind you see in display_windows covered with jewelry . Except on this form , Munroe experiments with patterns and fabrics that will eventually turn_up in her children ' s wear collection , Softhead . Characterized by classic silhouettes and fun novelty prints , Softhead apparel fits boys and girls from 6 months old to size 6 . &quot; I don ' t design anything very froufrou , &quot; says Munroe , who founded the company when her first daughter , Lauren , was born in 1989 . &quot; I just know what my children ' s needs and wants are. &quot; Back then , Munroe was a new mom fretting over the harmful effects of a thinning ozone_layer on her newborn . In search of proper protection , Munroe was inspired to stitch up a soft baseball_cap with an extended bill . Friends and strangers began asking about the reversible hats . Pregnant with her second daughter and not wanting to return to a demanding career as a traveling manufacturer systems consultant , Munroe was encouraged by her husband to begin Softhead hats . Plans for this enterprise were reinforced when a family member who represented a children ' s wear line asked to take the hats around on her circuit . The feedback , recalls Munroe , was thrilling . &quot; I have an MBA from UCI , not a fashion degree . I learned how to sew from my grandmother and until then just did_it on the side , &quot; she says . A year later she added matching shorts and floppy hats , and the collection has continued expanding . Silhouettes are kept timeless and basic . &quot; I think because I ' m not a designer I look_for simple patterns and fabrics that other mothers might like . There are a lot of designers who love to design beautiful things , but they don ' t consider the practical side of manufacturing , &quot; she says . With four girls under age 5 , Munroe knows the reality of_value . She considers affordable prices paramount , keeping sets under $ 50 . A reversible pant set with suspenders and a matching sweat shirt runs about $ 46 to $ 50 ; the ballet-length prairie dress is $ 42 to $ 46 . Softhead ' s signature hats are $ 18 to $ 20 . Dresses usually fall_into two categories : the two-tiered empire waist dress and the single-tiered empire waist . Both use a generous amount of yardage to allow_for twirling . For big boys , there are corduroy pants with a novelty print cuff that matches a panel of the same novelty fabric sewn on a colored sweat shirt . It ' s Softhead ' s novelty prints that have attracted parents and kids most , says Munroe . Anything goes : cowboy_hats , vegetables , cookies , the alphabet and animals . &quot; I look_for impact , color , nothing too cutesy . My kids , of course , tell me what they like , &quot; she says . Four-year-old Mallory agrees quickly , pausing only briefly from wiggling and giggling continuously in her patient mother ' s arms . &quot; The girls are very helpful , &quot; adds Mom . The four , including twins Kelsie and Jaime , ages 3 , serve as models in catalogue brochures . Working from home allows Munroe to spend maximum time with her family . Of course , a sitter comes three times a week to watch the girls so she can catch a_few quiet hours in her workroom or run to the contractors . Six sales representatives show Softhead nationwide , presenting the biannual collection to about 250 active accounts . Locally , it ' s available at the Miss Muffett Shoppe , Mission Viejo ; Oogly Boogly , Laguna Beach ; Nickle Arcade , Westminster ; Petit Bonhomme , San Clemente , and Muffins , Seal Beach . Although Munroe has her sights set_on plaids and garden flowers for ' 95 , she cautions that this is not an operation that will grow faster than her girls . &quot; My first job is as a mom . I ' ll keep doing this on the side -- like a hobby -- as long as I don ' t lose money. &quot;</TEXT>
