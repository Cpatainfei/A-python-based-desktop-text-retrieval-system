   <TEXT> Legends die_hard in Texas , and so the truth may never be known about who really killed Charles Whitman on top of the University of Texas tower here nearly three decades ago . Was it Officer Ramiro Martinez , showered with national acclaim as a true Texas hero , who rode that fame in a 20-year career with the fabled Texas_Rangers and was lionized in a made-for-TV movie ? Or was it Officer Houston McCoy , a lanky , slow-moving drifter who eventually left police work and took a twisted trail that has left him drunk , broke and divorced ? &quot; I ' m a west Texas cowboy and west Texas cowboys don ' t normally open their mouths , &quot; McCoy said the other day , after all these years coming_forth to claim , with a good_deal of proof , that he is the real hero . &quot; But if Ramiro Martinez was sitting right here and saying he shot Charles Whitman , I ' d call him a liar right to his face. &quot; One hundred miles away but worlds apart , Martinez feels equally unkind toward McCoy . &quot; All I can say is I feel sorry_for him , &quot; he said with a ring of disgust . Whomever it is , the man who shot Charles Whitman was the bravest of them all . Whitman , an altar_boy , an Eagle_Scout , a Marine -- the All-American Kid -- had climbed to the top of the 300-foot Texas landmark and opened_fire . In cold-blooded murder on a hot August day , 16 were left dead and 31 injured , and a nation forever changed . It was the first of its kind , the first time a madman would shoot_down so many innocent people in a public arena . It was 1966 , before police had SWAT teams and hostage negotiators , before police in Austin even had walkie-talkies or bulletproof_vests or the firepower to cut_down a crazy blond-haired sharpshooter who packed his footlocker full of guns and lugged it up the tower . The Whitman shooting spree stunned the nation , and more would follow in the years ahead . The San Ysidro McDonald ' s . The Stockton schoolyard . The post_office slayings . Today the random killings -- sometimes as_many as two or three a month -- often seem to go unnoticed , relegated to the back pages of the nation ' s newspapers . But in fact they are traumatic events in our lifetime , events so difficult to deal with that many of the survivors and their families and the police_officers forced to risk their lives never fully recover . That is certainly true in Texas . In some ways , said James Alan Fox , an East Coast criminologist , Whitman never died at all . Rather , he lives_on in the lore of the Wild_West , more so than most of the other killers Fox has studied as the co-author of two books about mass_murder in America . &quot; Charlie Whitman looked and acted so normal , &quot; said Fox , dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Boston . &quot; He targeted college_students , purely innocent people in the wrong place at the wrong time . He had all_the elements for affecting the American psyche. &quot; In the hoopla that surrounded the tower shooting , could the public have been duped ? If the wrong man was named a hero , how do you correct such a mistake ? How do you right history ? Maybe you don ' t . Maybe it ' s like that John Ford movie classic , &quot; The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance , &quot; in which the wrong man is honored for killing a notorious outlaw . At the end of the Western , the editor of the Shinbone Star , upon learning the truth , tears_up his notes and says : &quot; This is the West , sir . When fact becomes legend , print the legend. &quot; Thus , the legend . * Guns at the Whitman home . Guns in the family pickup . Guns at the firing_range and in long hunting trips in the Florida marsh . It was a love passed down from his father , Charles Whitman Sr. , who at 76 is still working in the plumbing business around West Palm Beach . The elder Whitman had three sons , and when each graduated high_school , he handed them a new car and &quot; all_the love I could give them. &quot; Today , all three boys are buried together in South Florida -- one killed in a barroom shootout in Florida , another lost to AIDS in California , and Charlie dead on top of the tower in Texas . &quot; We went hunting all_the time , &quot; the elder Whitman recalled in a recent interview , speaking_of his namesake and favorite_son . &quot; Both of us did . I taught him how to shoot before he even joined the Marines. &quot; He was rated a sharpshooter in the military , just one peg below expert , and it was said &quot; he could hit a quail on the fly with a . 22 rifle. &quot; Later he married , moved to Austin , and enrolled as an architectural_engineering student at the university here . He soon was earning A ' s and Bs . In the summer of 1966 he was a junior majoring in architectural_engineering , drove a Navy_blue Chevrolet Impala and , doctors discovered later , had a small tumor in his brain . The night before he climbed the tower , he shot his mother in her Austin apartment , then stabbed her with his old military bayonet . He lifted her body into bed and covered her with a floral bedspread . Then he returned to his little brick house , stabbed his wife five times , killing her , and before heading out for the campus , left a series of notes . He talked_about &quot; the pressures bearing_down , &quot; how he had &quot; decided to fight it out alone , &quot; how &quot; I am prepared to die. &quot; &quot; If there exists a God , &quot; he wrote , &quot; let Him understand my actions and judge me accordingly. &quot; He dressed in nylon coveralls and a white bandanna . He was hatless in the hot Texas sun . And he was armed . In the footlocker he had packed a sawed-off_shotgun , a . 35-caliber Remington pump rifle , a 6-millimeter Remington bolt-action rifle with four-power scope , a . 30-caliber M-1 carbine , a . 25-caliber pistol , a 9-millimeter Luger , and a . 357 Smith &amp; Wesson magnum pistol . He also carried three hunting_knives , one pocket_knife and about 1 # 200 rounds of ammunition . The typical Austin police_officer carried only a service revolver . For 99 minutes on Aug . 1 , Whitman ruled the campus . With deadly , pinpoint accuracy , he killed or wounded fellow students , a police_officer , shopkeepers and shoppers on busy Guadalupe Street , even a newspaper boy making his rounds on a bicycle . He was firing so fast and so often , with so many puffs of smoke coming from different angles on the observation deck , that many on the ground believed there were two or three snipers . Some thought it was the Black Panthers ; others thought it was student activists who ' d had enough of the Vietnam_War . &quot; Oh it hurt , &quot; said Lana Kay Mitchell , then a 20-year-old part-time student wounded on Guadalupe Street , now a mother and music_teacher . &quot; It deafened me it was so loud . It went_in my shoulder and hit a brick wall and bounced off . &quot; It was like a madhouse . I thought the whole world had gone crazy. &quot; Robert Heard , an Associated Press reporter , scrambled from the nearby Capitol building to the campus a_few blocks away . He saw several police_officers trying to make_it to the base of the tower . His instincts kicked_in and he followed them , trying to zigzag as he ran_across the campus lawn . Then he was hit in the arm . &quot; For three nights after that , I had nightmares , &quot; he said . &quot; It was always the same nightmare . I could see myself in the scope of a rifle and the cross-hairs were at my chest and I was running. &quot; But what he never saw was what happened on top of the tower because he never made_it there . If he had , he would have been the one professional objective observer , the one man who could have told the world who indeed shot Charles Whitman . * Whitman ' s bullet-riddled body was finally brought_down , his face and head nearly blown_off , his heart and chest a burned mess of gunpowder and shotgun pellets . A mad throng of people crowded , pushed , mauled even , to try to reach the stretcher and tear at his body . Anger was high , eyes were ablaze , and at that moment was born the hysteria . From the first day , Martinez was hailed as a hero . His photograph , larger even than Whitman ' s school mug_shot , covered a quarter of the front page of the next morning ' s Austin American . The caption read : &quot; SHOOTS SLAYER . Patrolman Ramiro Martinez put the first bullet into the sniper atop the University of Texas tower , and then emptied his police revolver as the sniper whirled and fired at him. &quot; Even Whitman ' s father , after flying to Austin to confer_with Chief Bob Miles and Martinez , came_away from the meeting convinced that Martinez had killed his boy . &quot; I believed he did_it and I still believe it today , &quot; the father said . &quot; And if I had been in his boots , I ' d have done the same thing. &quot; The plaudits came tumbling in , even the cherished National Police_Officers Assn . Medal of Valor , citing Martinez for bravery . He catapulted his stardom into a two-decade career with the Texas_Rangers , bought a new home_in New Braunfels , Tex. , and is still so well-known that he recently was elected a county justice_of_the_peace . Even after the sniper incident was turned_into a movie , which clearly portrayed him as the hero , he received an out-of-court_settlement with the producers because he did not like everything they said . After that , who would want to take_on the man who shot Charles Whitman ? Those same years passed hard for Houston McCoy . He left police work , and tried and failed at a series of odd jobs . He befriended the bottle , and he lost his wife . When he sued the same movie company for making him out a coward , the judge not only tossed_out the lawsuit , but also ordered him to pay the opposing attorney ' s fees . He lives today in a boarded-up laundry once owned by his family in tiny Menard , Tex . His memories are stuffed into a little cardboard box , full of yellowed newspaper_clippings and police reports and scribbles he can hardly read himself . He is too broke to pay_for copying fees . You want to read his files , bring a notebook . For inside that box lies his secret . There are the findings from Whitman ' s autopsy , which says that because of the numerous shotgun rounds fired by McCoy , it is impossible to tell whether any of Martinez ' s . 38-caliber slugs ever hit the sniper . And there is a statement from Austin ' s ex-Police Chief Miles , made shortly before his death , attesting to the fact that the media hoopla that rose so quickly around Martinez never gave authorities a chance to honor the right man , McCoy , a man too modest to assert his own heroism . &quot; When it came right down to it , &quot; the chief said , &quot; it was Houston McCoy who killed him . Houston got the short end of the stick_on publicity , if anyone wants to take credit for killing somebody. &quot; The chief ' s words were carried in a_few of the state ' s papers shortly after his death . But it never resurrected McCoy ' s reputation , nor dampened Martinez ' s . So now McCoy wants to say what he remembers what happened 30 stories above the University of Texas . But first let Martinez tell it . It was his day_off when he heard the news on the radio at_home . He said he dressed quickly , drove to the school , and immediately headed for the tower . &quot; Nobody had to tell me what to do , &quot; he said . He was met at the top by other Austin police_officers . While some of them helped several seriously wounded members of a Texarkana family who had been sightseeing when Whitman shot them , he and McCoy cautiously stepped_out on the lookout deck . Martinez was carrying his six-shot revolver and he crept forward along the outdoor tier . He said McCoy , armed with a shotgun , followed closely behind . Martinez turned a corner of the observation deck and spotted Whitman , crouched down at the end of the other tier . Martinez : &quot; I fired . All six times . Boom . Boom . You have to keep firing and you don ' t hesitate . And I hit him . He jerked up and he stood_up and kept firing and he was firing as he was being hit . But if I hadn ' t hit him first , he damn sure would have shot and killed me. &quot; Now McCoy . He was_on duty , but was bored and he said he was looking_for a place to hide and take a nap when the first police calls of the sniper shook him awake . He too sped straight to the scene , and made_it to the top of the tower , and did indeed follow slowly behind Martinez out onto the deck . But he said that when he turned the corner , it was clear that his partner had missed all six times because Whitman was calmly rising_up . Rising_up not in pain , but in anger . And he was clearly still alive . McCoy : &quot; I shot him once and his whole head went right back and I knew he was dead . Then I jacked another shell into my shotgun and I hit him again in the head and then I was through_with him . I knew he was dead then. &quot; But suddenly , McCoy said , Martinez was yelling for him to shoot Whitman again , and Martinez threw down his revolver and grabbed McCoy ' s shotgun and then , breaking_into a loud war_whoop , he ran_up to within inches of Whitman and blew away almost the entire top of his body . Then Martinez continued running_around the top of the tower , McCoy said , shouting to those below , &quot; ' I got him ! I got him ! ' &quot; But he was wrong , &quot; McCoy insisted . &quot; I killed Whitman . All Martinez did was kill a dead man. &quot; Martinez admitted he did let_out a cry and ran_up and shot Whitman with McCoy ' s shotgun . But he does not remember bragging from the tower . And he said he only grabbed McCoy ' s weapon because McCoy &quot; is a slow person , and he was slow in reacting. &quot; And about the police_chief recanting the official version of his heroism , Martinez said simply : &quot; That bothers me . But I can ' t talk_about the chief now that he ' s dead. &quot; * So there it is . Two men climbed_up into the sky that afternoon and met danger and risked their own lives to save others . Two men were brave that day . Their names are Ramiro Martinez and Houston McCoy . And one of them killed Charles Whitman .</TEXT>
