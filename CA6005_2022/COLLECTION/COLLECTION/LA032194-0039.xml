   <TEXT> Chip Davis , the Nebraska-based composer who appeared at the Universal Amphitheatre on Saturday with his Mannheim Steamroller , has been one of the remarkable success stories of the music business for nearly two decades . His loosely-defined ensemble is actually a range of different sized groups that have sold almost 10 million albums of original compositions Davis likes to describe as &quot; 18th-Century rock ' n ' roll. &quot; What he conducted with his full orchestra on Saturday , however , had very little_rock or roll , and a great_deal of atmospheric , film music-like themes bearing titles such_as &quot; Sunrise at Rhodes , &quot; &quot; Earthrise &quot; and &quot; Dancing Flames. &quot; Although Davis was also the composer of C . W . McCall ' s 1976 novelty hit &quot; Convoy , &quot; his preferences clearly lean toward combining easy-listening melodies with classical forms and orchestrations . But many of his pieces Saturday were so short , and so epigrammatic , that they functioned primarily as accompaniment for a series of big-screen projections of nature scenes . Davis ' conducting -- workmanlike and efficient with his own music -- produced a concert-opening reading of segments of the &quot; Spring &quot; Concerto from Vivaldi ' s &quot; Four Seasons &quot; that can most charitably be described as lugubrious . Mannheim Steamroller seems a more appropriate medium for his skills . DON HECKMAN</TEXT>
