   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : INVESTORS WILL HAVE TO GET OFF FENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Imagine you ' re the typical money manager getting_back to work this week after summer vacation . If you oversee a U.S. stock portfolio , you ' ve earned only about 0.5 % for your clients so far this year , even after August ' s big rally . that ' s about one-quarter what they would have earned just sitting in a money_market fund . If you manage a bond portfolio , you ' re in the red to the tune of about 2.2 % , as bond yields hover one to two percentage_points above year-end ' 93 levels despite recent signs of slower economic_growth . Now , summer ' s over , everybody ' s back in the office , and you ' ve got four months left in the year to make some money for your investors -- or face their disdain , not to mention that of your superiors , who determine how big ( or not ) your annual bonus will be . The reality of the calendar will be bearing_down_on Wall Streeters beginning this week , and that could help set the tone for stock and bond markets ' near-term trends . The fact is , many investment pros will have to make some big bets_on the markets ' direction over the next few months -- up or down -- to have any hope of producing hefty portfolio returns for 1994 . &quot; I would pretty much count_on everybody . . . getting more aggressive , &quot; said Robert Markman , head of Minneapolis-based Markman Capital Management , which directs $ 265 million of clients ' assets in mutual_funds . But whether any new-found aggressiveness is more likely to incite stock and bond rallies than selloffs remains to be seen . What seems certain is that many investors will have to get_off the fence about the economy , and bet either that it slows further in the fourth quarter or stays_on a healthy growth track . Unfortunately , last Friday ' s August employment report didn ' t help the fence-sitters make_up their minds . The markets rallied in the morning on news that only 179 # 000 jobs were created in August , then sold_off mildly after a closer look_at the report showed that the average workweek still is rising , as is manufacturing employment . The workweek and manufacturing-employment indicators suggest inherent strength in the economy , which many investors these days immediately associate with higher inflation -- reigniting the cycle of fear over future potential interest-rate hikes by the Federal_Reserve_Board . If you ' re growing tired_of this tug-of-war over the economy , so are many Wall Streeters . And that , combined with the calendar , could hasten big investors ' decisions to do something substantial with their money between now and year-end : Bet more heavily on stocks , or on bonds , or on cash as a safe haven . * What follows are a_few of the broad investment themes that some pros believe sidelined investors could latch onto in a major way , as the home stretch for markets in 1994 begins : * Get used to a healthy economy -- and take_advantage of it . The argument here is that the Fed hasn ' t materially harmed the U.S. economic recovery with higher interest_rates , and anyway that accelerating growth in the rest of the world will add_to U.S. growth what higher rates subtract . If you want to bet that the expansion goes_on and on , some investors advise sticking_with industrial stocks , and in particular buying commodity producers like paper , chemical and mining_companies -- especially if they pull_back after their latest run-up . A growing , all-capitalist world is bound to consume more basic goods . Yet John Lonski , economist at Moody ' s Investors Service in New York , notes that even with significant price increases this year , many commodities &quot; are still below levels in_effect toward the end of the 1980s. &quot; There ' s almost assuredly more to come , he says . One big believer in commodity producers such_as Alcoa and International Paper is Mark Howlowesko , who manages the global Templeton World and Templeton Growth_stock funds . &quot; I feel that we ' re moving from a period of increasing inflation in financial assets ( i.e. , stocks ) to increasing inflation in hard assets , &quot; he says . And while some commodity bears worry that supplies will more_than keep_up with demand , Howlowesko doesn ' t see it . With financial assets , he says , &quot; you can produce more with the stroke of a pen &quot; if demand rises . &quot; that ' s a lot harder to do with hard assets. &quot; * Overcome economic uncertainty by sticking_with true growth_stocks -- or with true value . If more investors give_up trying to guess the economy ' s next move and just feel desperate to put more money to work in_stocks , some pros see classic growth issues as the big winners this fall . The definition of a growth_stock is a company whose earnings are expected to rise at a brisk pace no matter what the economic backdrop . To Rod Linafelter , manager of the $ 2.2-billion Berger One-Hundred stock fund in Denver , that describes such technology stocks as Microsoft and Oracle Systems . &quot; I ' ve got 30 % of the portfolio in technology , and I can ' t recall a time when I felt more comfortable with the technology earnings outlook , &quot; Linafelter says . Individual tech companies may have their problems , but he sees no evidence that businesses and consumers will significantly slow their pace of investment in computers and related equipment overall . * Rich Lazarchic , manager of the IDS Managed Retirement_fund in Minneapolis , agrees that if the debate is between growth_stocks and value stocks ( the latter being slower-growing but less-expensively priced stocks ) , &quot; I think growth is going_to work better than value now . There just aren ' t that many real values left. &quot; He includes computer chip leader Intel and soft-drink giant PepsiCo in his growth-stock fold . If you can find true value , however , that may be as good a place as any to hedge your bet_on the broad market ' s next move . Richard Glasebrook , who runs the Quest_for Value Opportunity stock fund in New York , regards such stocks as Avon Products and insurer Transamerica Corp . as bona_fide values , selling for relatively low price-to-earnings multiples yet boasting very high returns on equity . His portfolio now is concentrated in those types of stocks . * Small stocks deserve better , in any economy . The average small-company stock , as measured by the Nasdaq composite index , still is down 2.3 % year-to-date , even after August ' s sharp rally . Byron Wien , strategist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co . in New York , argues that small-stock prices in_general don ' t adequately reflect the companies ' earnings potential . A Morgan universe of &quot; emerging-growth &quot; stocks , for example , is priced at about 15 times estimated 1995 earnings per share , just slightly above the 14 times for the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index . Yet the smaller companies ' estimated average annual earnings growth_rate over the next five years is 22 % , versus the S &amp; P ' s 7 % , Wien says . If markets still work , the price-to-earnings multiple of faster-growing smaller stocks deserves to be much higher than the S &amp; P ' s , Wien notes . Michael Di Carlo , manager of the John Hancock Special Equities small-stock fund in Boston , agrees . &quot; There ' s been an incredible valuation contraction &quot; among small stocks this year , he says , and he believes it can ' t last . * Bond yields may already reflect the worst-case scenario . Almost nobody likes the bond market anymore , but Bessemer Trust Co. ' s investment chief , Stan Nabi , argues that bonds at current yields offer stiff competition for stocks . With seven-year U.S. Treasury_notes yielding 7 % , Nabi says , &quot; that ' s a very decent return considering that inflation is only about 2.5 % . &quot; Even if inflation is perking_up , Nabi says , real bond yields already reflect that , while he regards many stocks as overpriced . * Bonds , naturally , are the best bet for anyone who wants to gamble that the economy will slow dramatically this fall . IDS ' s Lazarchic , in fact , expects to raise his fund ' s bond allocation from the current 10 % , to reap any payoff that might occur in bonds should investors suddenly flock to the slow-economy camp -- even if it ' s only a temporary rush . * Like Elvis , cash is still king . Short-term money_market investments have generally been the best place to hide this year , and Wall_Street ' s bears -- and even some non-bears -- don ' t think that will change this fall . Andy Engel , senior research analyst at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis , says the summer stock rally was only a blip in the trend . &quot; We ' re still expecting a prolonged bear_market , &quot; he says . His firm rates the market ' s relative value using 30 different measures , including &quot; book &quot; value and dividend yields . The points awarded to the market for those measures can total as much as a positive 1 # 815 or a negative 1 # 740 . The current reading : A negative 860 , or bear-market territory . Ron Ognar , manager of the Strong Growth_stock fund in Milwaukee , is no big bear . But he cautions investors against chasing stocks this fall . Be patient , and keep plenty of powder dry , he says . &quot; Our tack now is , ' Be careful , and buy on weakness. ' &quot; Wall_Street ' s Mixed Signals Is the stock_market ' s outlook rosy or black ? Here ' s what some pros are focusing_on : * Underlying demand : It ' s still strong . The public stepped_up its stock-mutual fund buying in August , and corporate takeovers and stock_buybacks are booming . What ' s more , many stock funds were carrying above-average cash levels before the August rally , and those levels haven ' t changed much since . that ' s fuel for future rallies . &quot; I ' ve got 14 % cash ( in a $ 2.2-billion fund ) and I don ' t want to be that high , &quot; says Rod Linafelter , manager of the Berger One-Hundred fund . * New supply : Down . Securities Data Co . counts 80 initial public stock offerings in the pipeline , expecting to raise $ 3.2 billion by year-end . So far in ' 94 , IPOs have raised an average of $ 2.5 billion per month . * Investor expectations : Low . Even after the August rally , only 33.9 % of the 140 investment newsletter writers polled weekly by Investors Intelligence in New Rochelle , N.Y. , are bullish . Nearly 47 % are bearish . The rest expect a new market &quot; correction. &quot; Many pros view a low bullish reading as a &quot; contrary &quot; sign that foretells higher stock prices . * Corporate earnings : Strong . Earnings-tracker Zacks Investment Research in Chicago says analysts expect S &amp; P 500 operating earnings to be up 20 % in the current quarter from a year ago . With restructurings of recent years , &quot; Even the smallest ( sales ) increases go right to companies ' bottom_lines now , &quot; says Ben Zacks . * Overall valuation : Not cheap , but not expensive either ? The average S &amp; P 500 stock is priced at 19 times the past four quarters ' earnings per share , and 15 times estimated 1994 earnings . Many Wall Streeters see that as a reasonable valuation . More troublesome , however , is the still-low average stock_dividend yield of 2.76 % -- historically a bear-market signal . * Seasonal trends : Worrisome , short-term . September is historically a losing month for stocks . In the last 10 years in particular , the S &amp; P 500 has fallen_in September 80 % of the time .
