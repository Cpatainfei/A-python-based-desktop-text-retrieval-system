   <TEXT> Forget the notion of the silent deep . The ocean of today is a noisy place filled with the sound of human_activity -- an aquatic wilderness that is becoming urbanized . Huge cargo_ships make a tremendous subsurface racket ; some supertankers are so loud they can be heard underwater a full day before they appear on the horizon . Along the continental_shelf , the rhythmic pounding of seismic air_guns used in oil exploration can travel hundreds of miles . Even louder are explosions during offshore construction and naval weapons testing . &quot; It ' s not a silent sea . It ' s a cacophony , &quot; said Darlene Ketten , a Harvard Medical_School specialist in marine mammals and hearing . &quot; The ocean is a phenomenally noisy environment. &quot; Commercial , military and scientific use of the ocean has reached such a pitch that some scientists and whale lovers worry that human noise_pollution may threaten the well-being of marine life . A recent proposal to study global warming by repeatedly transmitting a loud , low-frequency rumble across the Pacific_Ocean has aroused public concern that the din would disturb whales , dolphins and other animals highly dependent_on sound . Within the scientific community , the experiment has touched_off a heated debate over how much ocean noise is too_much . Some scientists say human-made noise could endanger an entire ocean ecosystem that depends_on sound , driving animals from their habitats and making_it harder for members of a species to locate each other and reproduce . &quot; This is not a bunch of whale-huggers who are upset about losing a_few whales , &quot; said Sylvia Earle , the former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a critic of the ocean sound tests . &quot; The issue is a much more profound question of what the impact of large pulses of sound on the ecosystem may be. &quot; Other scientists , including those who support the global warming experiment , argue that marine_animals have adapted well to loud natural sounds -- such_as underwater volcanoes and cracking polar ice -- and would not be unduly disturbed by the loud rumble from the global warming experiment . &quot; We are a very tiny addition to the background_noise created by the international shipping fleet , &quot; contended Andrew Forbes , deputy director of the sound experiment . &quot; We ' re not contributing even as much disturbance to the upper ocean as a single ship. &quot; Between natural and human-made sounds , a constant buzz of background_noise drones through most parts of the ocean . In the quietest regions -- areas of the South Pacific where there is little human_activity -- the typical background_noise of wind and waves is 80 decibels . This is about the same as the sound level in the desert on a quiet night . By contrast , many human sources of ocean noise exceed 180 decibels -- including supertankers and explosions -- a_level 10 billion times louder since the decibel scale is geometric . Underwater , sound is the most efficient means of communication for both man and beasts . Sound travels five times faster in water than in the air and can carry across an entire ocean through what scientists call the deep sound channels -- regions about 3 # 000 feet deep where temperatures and intense pressure combine to guide sound_waves over great distances . Navy submarines have long used the sound channels to talk to each other and spy on enemy subs . &quot; If you ' re going to communicate anything in the ocean , you ' re going to do_it by sound , &quot; said John Potter , a marine acoustics specialist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego . &quot; It ' s the natural mechanism for the transfer of information in the ocean. &quot; Just as people rely primarily on sight , marine creatures depend_on hearing to navigate , communicate and hunt . Now , scientists are discovering that some of the largest whales use sophisticated sonar in the same low-frequency range of most noise_pollution . The giant blue_whale emits a deep , loud call that can travel great distances through the deep sound channels , bouncing off land masses hundreds of miles away , said Christopher Clark , a Cornell University marine biologist who has been hired to study how the global warming experiment may affect marine mammals . Similarly , he said , finback_whales systematically probe their surroundings with rhythmic sound pulses . But so little is known about these creatures that scientists cannot say for_sure how they are affected by the noise of humans , particularly the cumulative effect of low-frequency sounds . No one is certain , for example , how deep most whales dive , what range of frequencies they hear or even how many whales there are . &quot; This dearth of scientific evidence makes_it virtually impossible to predict the effects of low-frequency sound on marine mammals . . . , &quot; concluded a recent study by the National Research Council , an arm of the National Academy of Sciences . Underwater explosions , fishing_nets and collisions with large ships claim the lives of many marine mammals each year . But Earle and other scientists worry that the effects of ocean noise are more insidious . Tests done earlier by researchers off Monterey show that migrating gray_whales will alter their course to avoid an underwater sound source of 120 decibels or more . Another study indicates that some whales can suffer temporary hearing_loss when exposed to sounds as low as 150 decibels . Supertankers are the largest human-made source of ocean noise , according to the National Research Council study . These ships can produce low-frequency sounds of up_to 232 decibels -- equivalent in the air to a military jet . Some shipping noise enters the deep sound channels and carries for long distances . Scott Kraus , associate scientist at the New England Aquarium in Boston , said rising noise_levels may help explain why 30 % of all_right whale deaths in the North Atlantic result from collisions with ships . These slow-moving whales may have become used to the sound of shipping traffic and have difficulty picking_out the sound of individual ships bearing_down_on them until it is too late , he said . A spokesman for the shipping industry , however , was surprised that anyone was even questioning vessel noise . &quot; What do they want , no ships in the ocean ? &quot; asked Ernest Corrado , president of the American Institute of Maritime Shipping , which represents most of the nation ' s major shipping_companies . &quot; We have water_pollution , air_pollution -- the latest thing was our ballast water . Noise_pollution ? that ' s a whole new one. &quot; Even louder than individual supertankers are the seismic exploration ships that search for oil deposits by firing air_guns every 10 or 20 seconds at the ocean_floor . The guns , which simultaneously release bursts of air_bubbles , can reach 240 decibels . Scientists who monitor acoustic activity in the ocean with hydrophones say they can hear the repeated firing of air_guns as far as 500 miles away . &quot; Frankly , that would drive me nuts , &quot; said Potter , who has spent many research hours listening to the air_guns booming away . Oil_industry officials , however , say studies have found no evidence the noise harms marine life . Whales that don ' t like the sound can avoid areas where survey ships are operating , said Jeff Wilson , a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Assn . Air_guns , he noted , are an improvement over the days when dynamite was used . &quot; There is no evidence that air_guns used in marine geophysical surveys injure or disturb whales , &quot; he said . One of the loudest ocean noises is the sound of blasting during construction of piers and other marine facilities . In 1992 , at least two humpback_whales off Newfoundland were killed in an explosion during pier construction . Ketten , the Harvard expert , examined the whales after they became entangled in fishing_nets and found they had suffered from severe ear trauma , including shredded eardrums and crushed ear bones , that would have deafened them . Scientists also said the explosions -- later calculated to have reached 296 decibels -- may have caused other humpback_whales to suffer hearing_loss , impairing their ability to detect obstacles ; after the blasting began , fishermen in the area noticed a sudden increase in the number of humpbacks snared in their nets . A 1972 federal law designed to protect marine mammals requires the National Marine Fisheries Service to issue permits for the incidental harassment of whales . But the Navy , shipping and commercial fishing are largely exempt from the requirement . Since World_War_II , the Navy has conducted weapons tests -- such_as ship shock tests off the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary using 10 # 000-pound bombs -- and high-decibel acoustic experiments in the ocean under a cloak of secrecy . Only now , with the end of the Cold_War and a growing emphasis on research for civilian purposes , are such tests becoming public . The global warming experiment is one of the first to go_through the process of obtaining a federal permit for harassment of marine mammals . The controversial plan to take the ocean ' s temperature with underwater sound_waves is the brainchild of Walter Munk , one of the world ' s leading physical oceanographers . Now 75 , he has worked with the Navy on and off since World_War_II , when he correctly predicted the magnitude of waves for Allied invasions of North Africa and Normandy . Later , he assisted the Navy by analyzing how Bikini Island nuclear_weapons tests affected the ocean . For more_than a decade , Munk has worked_on mapping the sea through acoustic tomography -- a sort of ocean CAT scan using 185-decibel sounds transmitted over distances of 600 miles to learn about temperature , tides and currents . Munk , based at Scripps Institution of Oceanography , said he developed the idea of using sound to study ocean temperatures after hearing how a scientist dropped dynamite into the ocean near Australia and picked_up sound of the explosion off Bermuda . &quot; Using sound in the ocean , if done properly , is a most powerful tool , &quot; he said . Since sound travels faster in warmer water , Munk hopes to measure average deep sea temperature_changes of as little as one five-thousandth of a degree across the Pacific basin . If the study shows the thermometer rising , he said , it could provide clear evidence of global warming and help governments plan how to reduce the atmospheric carbon gases believed responsible . The initial $ 35-million , two-year experiment is sponsored by the Defense_Department , which will have access to all_the data for military use , such_as improving submarine surveillance . Munk and his colleagues have applied for federal permits to place loudspeakers about 3 # 000 feet deep on the ocean_floor off Big Sur and the Hawaiian island of Kauai . These would transmit low-frequency , coded signals of up_to 195 decibels across the Pacific . A hearing on the California permit is set for May 16 in Santa Cruz . Although the speakers might not be as loud as air_guns or some supertankers , test sponsors acknowledge they would produce the dominant human-made sound in the regions where they are placed -- the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and a breeding area for humpback_whales off Hawaii . Munk said he has tried to use the softest noise possible , noting the signal would be so faint when it reaches New Zealand it must be plucked out of the background_noise by high-tech Navy listening gear . Scientists agree that any effect on animals will occur near the loudspeakers . Within about 500 feet of the speakers , project scientists estimate , the sound will remain at 150 decibels or above , potentially loud enough to cause temporary hearing_loss in some whales . But they say it is highly unlikely any animals would stay within that range long enough to affect their hearing . For 18 miles in all directions , however , the volume would be at least 120 decibels -- the level known to produce an aversion response among gray_whales . Off Big Sur , the oceanographers estimate that as_many as 677 # 000 marine mammals , including a number of endangered species , live_in or would pass_through that circle of sound and could be disturbed by the noise . As part of the experiment , Munk has brought_in leading marine mammal researchers to see how the noise affects key indicator species , such_as humpback_whales and the deep-diving elephant_seal . Researchers will monitor a sample of these animals from land and from airplanes at least 1 # 000 feet above the water . They want to see if the creatures alter their behavior when the sound is_on . Clark , the Cornell marine biologist , insists the animal-watchers will be able to determine whether the sound is disruptive . And Munk promises to halt or modify the test if they discover the noise is harming animals . But opponents say the effort is flawed because insufficient data has been gathered ahead of time about the normal behavior of these species . And , they say , it will be hard to see from the air or the coast what effect the noise has_on creatures that spend their lives underwater . As an alternative , some critics have called_for non-invasive methods of measuring ocean temperatures , such_as using large_numbers of thermometers that could be monitored by satellite . At the very least , they say , the loudspeakers should be moved to locations with fewer marine mammals and endangered species . &quot; To those who say it doesn ' t matter , I say it matters_to all_of us , &quot; Earle said . &quot; The ocean is being subjected_to many stresses . We don ' t know what the outcome of our actions may be_on the ocean ecosystem , but it is not likely to be in our best interest to disrupt things unnecessarily. &quot; Sounding Off Some scientists worry that the addition of new human noises to the ocean may disturb marine creatures that are highly dependent_on sound . Because scientists use different starting_points to measure sound in water and in air , the decibel scale for underwater sound begins at 61.5 decibels , instead of zero . The decibel scale is geometric , so an increase of 10 decibels signifies a sound that is 10 times louder , an increase of of 20 is 100 times louder . Here are some typical peak levels for low-frequency sound sources in the ocean : Background_noise in quiet ocean far from shipping : 80 db Background_noise in ccoastal region near shipping : 105 db The point at which a whale would head away from the sound : 120 db Small motorboat : 135 db Ice noises in polar region : 140-155 db Whale vocalizations : 150-195 db The global warming sound test loudspeaker : 195 db Geophysical phenomena ( earthquakes , volcanoes ) : 160-240 db Large ships and supertankers : 170-230 db Large underwater explosion : 250-295 db Source : Scripps Institution of Oceanography .</TEXT>
