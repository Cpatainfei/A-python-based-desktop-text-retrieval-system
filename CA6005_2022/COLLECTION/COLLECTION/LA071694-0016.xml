   <HEADLINE> SENATE OKS FOREIGN_AID BILL ; HELP FOR RUSSIA CUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Senate approved a $ 13.7-billion foreign_aid bill Friday that sharply reduces U.S. assistance to Russia and other countries of the former Soviet_Union and readjusts other spending priorities to reflect some of the disappointments of the new_world order . Passed 84 to 9 after several days of contentious debate over the Clinton_Administration policy toward Haiti , the pared spending bill for the next fiscal_year must now be reconciled with similar legislation already approved by the House . Both bills would give President Clinton about $ 400 million less than he had requested for foreign_aid in fiscal_year 1995 and represent a decline of about $ 700 million in the overall foreign assistance budget . As in years past , the lion ' s share of the ever-shrinking foreign_aid budget has gone_to Israel and Egypt , which together would receive nearly $ 5.2 billion in economic and military assistance . African_nations of the sub-Sahara also would fare better this year , receiving $ 802 million in development aid -- a slight increase over last year . But reflecting what senators said was their disappointment with the Administration ' s handling of aid programs for the former Soviet_Union , Russia and the other ex-Soviet states would receive $ 839 million in fiscal 1995 -- $ 61 million less than Clinton requested and a significant drop from last year ' s $ 2.5-billion aid program . Clinton , however , would get most of what he requested , although his allies in the Senate had to fight hard to beat_back two Republican-led attempts to challenge his Haiti policy . Both efforts were defeated , but not until a long debate made_it plain that most senators still oppose use of U.S. military_force to depose Haiti ' s rulers . Expected challenges to Clinton ' s handling of the crises in Bosnia-Herzegovina and North_Korea were postponed or failed to materialize . GOP strategists decided not to engage in a fight over Bosnia after narrowly losing a bid earlier this month to force Clinton to lift the Bosnian arms embargo . Critics of the Administration ' s North_Korea policy , however , won approval of an amendment that would bar Clinton from offering the Pyongyang regime any future aid unless he can certify that the North_Koreans possess no nuclear_weapons , have halted any nuclear_weapons program and are not exporting weapons-grade plutonium to other countries . Although largely academic , because the United States provides no assistance to North_Korea , the provision could limit the incentives the Administration will have when negotiations aimed at persuading Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program resume in Geneva . The senators also inserted a number of other restrictions on the way Clinton could disburse foreign_aid next year by earmarking specific sums for individual recipients -- a practice that the House bill largely avoided this year . Of $ 839 million appropriated for the former Soviet states , for instance , $ 250 million was earmarked for Ukraine , Armenia and Georgia , while $ 30 million was set_aside to help the FBI and Russian police combat a rising wave of international crime .</TEXT>
