   <HEADLINE> SINGAPORE DEFENDS AMERICAN TEEN ' S FLOGGING SENTENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The government here on Friday rejected U.S. criticism of a court ' s decision to sentence an Ohio teen-ager to be flogged for spray-painting cars , saying the country ' s tough laws have saved it from the fate of New York , &quot; where vandalism is commonplace. &quot; The government also rejected foreign pleas for clemency for four foreigners who were sentenced to death for drug trafficking . A Thai and three Hong Kong nationals were hanged Friday morning at Changi Prison , after Amnesty International called_on thousands of supporters to send appeals for clemency to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong . Singapore has hanged 52 people for drug offenses since the death_penalty was imposed in 1975 . Another human_rights dispute appeared to be brewing in the case of Michael P . Fay , the 18-year-old American who was sentenced Thursday to six strokes of a cane and four months in prison after pleading guilty to two charges of vandalism , two charges of mischief and one count of possessing stolen property . Fay , of Dayton , Ohio , was freed on $ 48 # 000 bail while his attorneys prepared an appeal . The American Chamber_of_Commerce in Singapore said it was &quot; shaken &quot; by Fay ' s sentence . It said it has supported the government ' s enforcement of law and order , which is one reason Singapore is attractive to American business . &quot; However , we simply do not understand how the government can condone the permanent scarring of any 18-year-old boy -- American or Singaporean -- by caning for such an offense , &quot; the chamber said in a statement , adding , &quot; It is impossible to predict how this will affect American business_activity , but it is likely to cast a cloud_over Singapore ' s international reputation. &quot; Ralph Boyce , the U.S. charge d ' affaires who attended the sentencing , took the rare step of publicly criticizing the court ' s decision . &quot; We see a large discrepancy between the offense and the punishment , &quot; Boyce said . &quot; The cars were not permanently damaged ; the paint was removed with thinner . Caning leaves permanent scars . In addition , the accused is a teen-ager and this is his first offense. &quot; Fay is believed to be the first American ever sentenced to a caning , in which a trained martial_arts expert flogs a prisoner with a half-inch-thick rattan_cane . &quot; Unlike some_other societies which may tolerate acts of vandalism , Singapore has its own standards of social order as reflected in our laws , &quot; the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement . &quot; It is because of our tough laws against anti-social crimes that we are able to keep Singapore orderly and relatively crime free . We do not have a situation where acts of vandalism are commonplace as in cities like New York , where even police_cars are not spared the acts of vandals. &quot; The statement said that in the last five years , 14 people , ages 18 to 21 , had been sentenced to imprisonment and caning for vandalism , including two foreigners . &quot; Singapore expects its citizens to follow the laws of the countries they visit or reside in . Similarly , we also expect foreigners in Singapore to abide_by our laws , &quot; the ministry said . Several Americans who live_in Singapore said privately that they believe that the government attached great importance to the Fay case in_order to send a message to Singaporeans about the dangers of &quot; decadent &quot; Western culture . Singapore is a longtime ally of the United States , linked by expanding trade and security ties . The United States operates a facility for U.S. Navy ships in Singapore , and there are more_than 200 U.S service personnel based here . But the relationship has had its up and downs . In the 1980s , an American diplomat was expelled for interfering in Singapore ' s domestic affairs by speaking_to opposition politicians . The government has also barred a number of American journalists from attending international conferences here , despite the objections of the U.S. secretary_of_state .</TEXT>
