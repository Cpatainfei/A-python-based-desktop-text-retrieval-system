   <HEADLINE> FAILED JAPAN TRADE TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * While I applaud President Clinton ' s attempt to force Japan to stop its restrictive trade_policies ( Feb . 12 ) , NAFTA will let Japan get_in through the back_door by allowing Japan to produce cars in Mexico and ship them into the U.S. duty-free . Do you suppose the fact that Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is aware of this has strengthened his stand against dropping Japan ' s trade_barriers ? Why should he fear American retaliation when he knows that NAFTA gives Japan an even better deal ? EDWIN C . BAUR Rancho Palos Verdes * There is much I agree with in the commentary by Alan Stoga ( Feb . 8 ) regarding trade friction between Japan and the United States . Of the several statements I disagree_with , the most glaring is as follows : &quot; But the core U.S. demand , in_effect , that Japan should guarantee specific shares of its market for American-made imports . . . . &quot; Stoga is wrong in his interpretation of the American position . This is the &quot; spin &quot; Japan gives the trade talks . I have not heard Clinton , Lloyd Bentsen , Ron Brown or Mickey Kantor make statements as described by Stoga . What they have said repeatedly is that some system must be devised to measure progress_to which both countries can concur . Japan and the United States both agree that the trade_deficit with the U.S. must be reduced . This Administration ' s position is a far_cry from managed trade , such_as was instituted by the Bush_Administration regarding the semiconductor industry . BALDWIN T . ECKEL Upland * Hosokawa ' s obdurate stance against easing the inequitable trade_balance between his country and the U.S. is a cynical insult , and should not be tolerated . Enough of pacifying and turning of cheek in the face of such monumental conceit . President Clinton should lose no time to implement the high-priority , high-profile trade actions against Japan that are at his disposal . It is high_time we utilize some of the tactics , admittedly onerous , but favored for so_long by Japan , like &quot; harassment tools &quot; on automobiles , limiting Japanese cellular_telephone sales in the U.S. , scaling back tax_benefits given to Japanese auto_makers in the U.S. , and enforcing laws against the practice of &quot; dumping. &quot; Appeasement has been exposed as a horrendous military failure . It is no less a losing proposition in commerce , where one &quot; trading &quot; party has been consistently hostile and uncooperative for more_than four decades . Not incidentally , those of us who continue to opt_for Japanese cars and trucks , despite their much greater cost and the proven equality of American-made models , give comfort and support to our economic enemy . LOUIS CONCILIO Garden Grove * Regarding your article on Motorola ' s difficulties in doing business with Japan because of its alleged untruths , legal costs , etc . ( Feb . 21 ) : The U.S. can build scientific products and equipment that can go_to the moon , yet somehow the Japanese allege that the quality of our manufactured products does not meet the standards for their ordinary little automobiles . Let ' s respond that the quality of the Japanese &quot; business ethic &quot; does not meet our standards , and refuse their business as they refuse our products . Let us proceed from there . KENNETH M . HAMILTON La Jolla * In response to &quot; In Japan , Fair Trade Is Matter of Perception , &quot; news analysis , Feb . 17 : Contained in that otherwise useful article is a phrase that also perpetuates a perception , one that reinforces the value of confrontation over debate , that Japan prohibited trade with foreigners until &quot; . . . the cannons of Commodore Matthew Perry ' s Black Ships abruptly ended the empire ' s isolation. &quot; Samuel Eliot Morison ' s biography , &quot; Old Bruin Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry &quot; ( 1967 ) , clearly reports Perry ' s ( not so abrupt -- over a period of five years ) negotiation with Japan as unique in an era of gunboat_diplomacy . Perry was praised as having brought : &quot; This secluded empire into the intercourse of nations as one of the great events of the age . . . the more so as it has been accomplished , not by bloodshed and the devastation of war , but by means of a frank , energetic and determined course of negotiation. &quot; We need less loose cannons and more diplomacy . And more knowledge of the difference between special_interests and public benefit on both sides of the Pacific . Even today Japanese use the phrase &quot; black ships &quot; to characterize unwanted foreign pressure , but the political dynamic in Japan in the 1850s was a domestic desire to end isolation and feudal oppression .
