   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : WESTMINSTER ; TRAFFIC LIMIT FOES BLOCK GENERAL PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Opposition from property_owners is delaying the adoption of Westminster ' s General Plan , the document that guides the city ' s growth and development . After more_than two years , the city is not close to adopting the document because property_owners are objecting to a key provision that requires future developments to meet traffic limits . Under the proposed General Plan , properties designated as &quot; planned development &quot; are assigned ADTs , or average daily trips , which serve as a kind of quota of how much traffic that property is allowed to generate . City officials say that is necessary to avoid congestion , minimize pollution and maintain the quality_of_life . But property_owners say it ' s a prescription for slow growth or no growth that would drive property values down . &quot; This is not a well-accepted idea , &quot; said Hal Mintz , a mobile_home park consultant on the ADT requirement during a public hearing this week in which the General Plan was again presented to the City_Council for adoption . &quot; If you nail_down everything on numbers , &quot; Mintz told the council , &quot; you ' ll be making a serious mistake. &quot; City officials say no other city in Orange County has adopted ADTs as a foundation for its General Plan . &quot; Everybody seems to be against it , &quot; Mayor Charles V . Smith said . &quot; I see no good reason to keep it. &quot; Councilman Frank Fry Jr . said traffic limits would restrict growth and &quot; turn the city to a slum. &quot; &quot; This puts a burden on the property_owners , &quot; Councilman Tony Lam said . &quot; ADTs are a handicap in the use of the land. &quot; The council directed the Building and Planning Department to find ways to eliminate the ADT requirement without scuttling the rest of the General Plan . The proposed changes to the General Plan will be the first since 1965 . The city has hired a consultant , Lightfoot Planning Group , to help prepare the document , which addresses such issues as land use , circulation , housing , open space , conservation , safety and noise . Planning and Building Director Mike Bouvier said that the city has spent about $ 360 # 000 so far in the preparation of the document . BERT ELJERA</TEXT>
