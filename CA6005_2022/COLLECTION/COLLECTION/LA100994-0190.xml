   <HEADLINE> IN THE MATTER OF JUSTICE THOMAS ; SILENT , ALOOF AND FREQUENTLY DOGMATIC , CLARENCE THOMAS ' JUDICIAL PERSONA EMERGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Exactly at 10 o ' clock_on a Monday morning , the strike of a gavel echoes through the courtroom , and the nine black-robed justices of the Supreme Court emerge from behind a red velvet curtain . As those assembled in the ornate hall take their seats , the lead lawyer rises , and the arguments begin . Soon , most of the justices are up_on their elbows , hurling questions at the attorneys . Justices Sandra Day O ' Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg take turns poking holes in the advocate ' s argument . Justice Antonin Scalia , sympathetic to his case , leaps in to prop_up his contention . &quot; Aren ' t you really arguing that . . . , &quot; Scalia offers helpfully . Anthony M . Kennedy , looking pensive , asks a philosophical question . Troubled by the answer , Justices David Souter and John Paul Stevens want to know how far the advocate seeks to push his claim . All the while , Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist leafs through the briefs , trying to find a disputed passage of the law in_question . But one justice looks_out of place . At the far end of the bench , Justice Clarence Thomas rocks back in his leather chair and gazes at the ceiling . He rubs his eyes and stares off into the distance . Sometimes , Thomas has a brooding look , as if he is pondering deeply . More often , he just looks bored . &quot; I don ' t understand it . He is engaged , &quot; says a former Thomas clerk , who like most of those who have worked for him , expresses great admiration for the justice . &quot; He likes to argue out the issues in chambers &quot; and displays a special_interest in bankruptcy law and state tax disputes , he says . But Thomas ' interest is not apparent in the courtroom . While Scalia and Ginsburg may ask five or six questions during a one-hour argument , Thomas asked not a single question during the last term of the court . Lawyers in Washington and visitors to the courtroom never fail to comment on how removed he seems . &quot; What ' s wrong with Clarence Thomas ? &quot; one lawyer new_to the high_court commented . &quot; He just sits there. &quot; that ' s a marked contrast from his 18 months on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington , says a judge who observed him then . &quot; He ' s like two different people , &quot; says the judge . &quot; He was talkative , gregarious on our court , a real participant . Now he seems to be in a shell. &quot; This eerie courtroom silence has marked Thomas ' career for all_of the three years since he inadvertently became the best-known member of the Supreme Court . At first it seemed that he was simply trying to retreat , somehow , from the stinging visibility of the &quot; he said , she said &quot; confrontation with Prof . Anita Hill that made him the ostensible villain in a TV drama about sexual_harassment . It was , perhaps , the worst imaginable fate for a fiercely proud and intensely dignified man . For a time he was the most carefully watched , most reviled man in town . On the November day he took the oath of office at the court , his ceremonial walk down the marble steps was cut_short when a small group of protesters began to boo and shout , &quot; Down with the Male Supremacist Court. &quot; Not surprisingly , rather than beam for assembled photographers , Thomas turned_away and walked back into the basement of the court . A few months later , the new justice accepted an invitation to judge a moot_court competition at Seton Hall University Law_School but canceled when word came that a women ' s student group was planning a candlelight vigil . Wounded , Thomas retreated into the silence that protects a judge who is even more rigid and dogmatic than his opponents feared . As the hoopla over the man has died_down , his judicial record has become clearer . He has compiled the most conservative voting record on a conservative court and lambasted his colleagues for refusing to go_further in changing the law . He has voted to revoke the right to abortion and return some prayer to the public_schools . He cast a key vote to cut_off further hearings in a death_penalty case , even when newly revealed evidence might have proven the defendant ' s innocence . He cast the deciding votes to make_it harder for minorities to prove they were victims of job discrimination , harder for victims of stock fraud to sue lawyers and harder for environmentalists to be heard in court . &quot; He has shown himself to be exactly what his opponents said he would be : a knee-jerk right-winger , &quot; says University of Virginia law professor Pamela Karlan . &quot; He was always going_to be tainted somewhat for how he got_to the court , but I think he is going_to be more tainted by how he is acting now . He ' s shown no capacity for growth. &quot; Georgetown University Law Center Associate Dean Mark Tushnet concurs . &quot; So far , it ' s been the least impressive performance of any justice since Whittaker , &quot; he says , referring to justly forgotten Charles Whittaker , who resigned from the court in 1962 after having a nervous_breakdown in his fifth year . But friends and admirers say Thomas is unfairly treated because he is a conservative . &quot; He is not the justice that the NAACP would like , &quot; says Stephen McAllister , a former Thomas clerk who teaches law at the University of Kansas . &quot; He brings his own perspective to the law , but he certainly knows what it was like to grow_up poor and black. &quot; Fueling the debate are Thomas ' activities outside the court . The confirmation fight separated Thomas ' allies from his enemies , and it deepened an already strong commitment to conservative values . While other justices avoid any appearance of partisanship , he boasts of his friendship with conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh , speaks mostly to gatherings of conservatives , brags about not reading the papers and indulges a &quot; not politically correct &quot; fondness for smoking cigars and driving a black Corvette . Both his demeanor and his record have renewed questions about his qualifications for the high_court . No one , not even Thomas himself , had rushed to defend President George_Bush ' s assessment that he was &quot; the best_man for the job. &quot; After all , he had had no significant legal experience as a prosecutor , defense_attorney , trial_lawyer , law professor or judge and had spent only a year as Bush ' s appointee to the influential U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington when he was nominated to the Supreme Court . But at the very least , Thomas promised , he would be impartial . &quot; My personal views have no place in adjudication , &quot; he said . &quot; I can assure you , I have no agenda. &quot; Many of those who believed him , such_as Sen . Arlen Specter , a moderate Pennsylvania Republican who cast a key vote for him , now admit they are dismayed by Thomas ' record . &quot; Frankly , I have been very disappointed with his first three years , &quot; Specter says . &quot; I had thought his roots would show . But he came_out of those hearings a changed man , an embittered man. &quot; * Each day when the court is in session , Thomas and his wife , Virginia , leave their new home_in suburban Virginia and drive into town before most Washingtonians have hit the road . &quot; We travel everywhere together , like a pair of nuns , &quot; Thomas tells friends . His wife , a senior policy coordinator for the House Republican Conference , was said by friends to have been deeply hurt by her husband ' s confirmation ordeal . She said they survived by praying together . It &quot; was not a normal political battle . It was spiritual warfare . Good versus evil , &quot; she told a_People magazine interviewer a_few days after his confirmation . Theirs is a strange sort of celebrity : They are instantly recognized but seldom seen outside carefully chosen venues . While none of the justices sits for TV interviews on Sunday morning , most make the rounds of bar groups , civic organizations and law_schools , giving speeches and answering questions about the work of the court . As members of the nation ' s highest_court , they can count_on a warm reception and instant respect . Not so with the youngest justice . &quot; It ' s like he ' s in the federal witness protection program , &quot; says one prominent Washington lawyer . Thomas has told friends he quit watching most television -- for a time , he was a regular punch_line on some sitcoms -- and stopped reading most newspapers and magazines , with the exception of reliably conservative publications such the Washington Times . ( He also refused requests to be interviewed for this story. ) &quot; They can say absolutely anything they want about me . I will never read them again to see it , &quot; he told one friendly interviewer last year . But the confirmation struggle sealed his loyalty to those who stood with him . Each morning as he lifts weights in the Supreme Court ' s gym before his workday begins , he says he likes to listen to tapes of Rush Limbaugh poking_fun at feminists , environmentalists and all manner of liberal crusaders . The men are more_than passing acquaintances . On May 27 , when the rotund entertainer married for the third time in a ceremony at the home of Virginia and Clarence Thomas , the justice performed the official duties . After a sit-down dinner , the assembled guests gathered for &quot; cigars and adult beverages on the deck , &quot; according to Limbaugh ' s office . Among friends , Thomas hardly appears to be a bitter man hidden in his shell . &quot; He is not brooding or angry at all , &quot; says McAllister , his former clerk . &quot; I found him to be warm , supportive and friendly . He has a positive outlook. &quot; He has a big handshake and a hearty laugh , although his eyes have a wary look . As a speaker , he has an endearingly personal style . Far from being the polished high official whose comments drift above the audience , Thomas speaks slowly , emotionally , as if measuring each word to describe his joys and pain . Almost invariably he speaks_of his childhood and recounts stories about his grandfather . Even if the tales are a bit familiar now , he comes_across as warm , genuine and personal . From the start , conservatives pointed to Thomas life_story as his main qualification for the high office . Here was a man , the vaunted story went , who was born to a teen-age mother in a dirt-floor shanty near the marshes of Pinpoint , Ga. , and grew_up poor in the segregated South . When his mother could no longer care_for him , young Thomas was rescued first by his grandparents and then by the Catholic_schools , working his way through Holy Cross College and then Yale Law_School , where he graduated a year behind Bill_Clinton . &quot; I was drunk with anger , &quot; he told students at Holy Cross , describing himself in the late 1960s , &quot; out of control with hostility toward what I saw as the oppression around me. &quot; But his up-from-poverty experience brought him to far different conclusions than did the middle-class upbringing of Thurgood Marshall , his black liberal predecessor on the court . Success depends_on hard work and individual effort , says Thomas , espousing the lessons that conservatives champion , and government welfare checks or official &quot; affirmative_action &quot; preferences serve only to hurt blacks by dampening their drive and cheapening their accomplishments . Thomas was denouncing his sister back home_in Pinpoint for being dependent_on her monthly welfare check when he came_to the attention of leaders of the incoming Ronald Reagan_Administration at a 1980 conference of young conservatives in San Francisco . ( The sister , Emma Mae Martin , was receiving welfare assistance while raising her children and caring for an aunt but soon after worked her way off welfare. ) Offers of government positions followed , and despite Thomas ' having announced that he would not work_on &quot; black issues , &quot; he became assistant secretary for civil_rights in the Education_Department in 1981 . A year later , he was named chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , the agency charged with enforcing the laws against job discrimination , though he often seemed skeptical of its mandate . He had no patience with the civil_rights activists who urged him to enforce the law more vigorously . All they do , he said , is &quot; bitch , bitch , bitch , moan and whine and whine. &quot; In a steady round of provocative speeches , he denounced the conventionally liberal positions on race and civil_rights , criticized environmentalists , called_for strengthening property_rights and praised as &quot; splendid &quot; an article calling_for the reversal of the Roe vs . Wade ruling that legalized abortion . His star rose quickly in the Reagan_Administration , and Bush ' s Court of Appeals appointment signaled what came next : He ' d be the designated Republican successor to the aging Justice Thurgood Marshall . In five days of Senate testimony -- largely obscured by Anita Hill ' s later accusations -- Thomas publicly backed_away from many of his earlier statements . &quot; A judge must be fair and impartial , &quot; Thomas said in his opening statement to the committee . &quot; A judge must_not bring_to his job , to the court , the baggage of preconceived notions , of ideology , and certainly not an agenda. &quot; When asked about his previous comments on affirmative_action or the right to abortion , about his criticisms of liberal decisions and his long track record of deriding the civil_rights establishment , Thomas reverted to the same theme . He denied he had any such strong views , and regardless , none of it would affect his judicial role . A justice has a nearly sacred duty &quot; to strip_down like a runner , to eliminate agendas , to eliminate ideologies , &quot; he said . When interpreting the law , &quot; it is the will of the legislature that counts , &quot; he added reassuringly . Thomas raised eyebrows when he testified that he had never discussed or debated Roe vs . Wade , even during his law_school days when the case was decided . Asked about the separation of church and state and the so-called &quot; Lemon test &quot; often criticized by conservatives , Thomas replied that he had &quot; no quarrel &quot; with it . ( The term refers to the court ' s 1971 ruling in Lemon vs . Kurtzman that it will strike_down any law or government program that has religious purpose , advances religion or creates &quot; an entanglement &quot; between church and state. ) &quot; I think the wall of separation is an appropriate metaphor , &quot; Thomas commented , sounding more like a Jeffersonian liberal than a Reagan-era conservative . He also praised the doctrine of stare decisis , Latin for letting the_matter stay as decided . Many senators were skeptical , but the nominee sought to reassure them . &quot; I understand your concern that people come here and they might tell you A and then do B , &quot; he told one senator who had pressed him on the abortion issue . &quot; But I can assure you . . . I have no agenda. &quot; This was not the Clarence Thomas whose provocatively conservative speeches , articles and statements the committee Democrats had reviewed for weeks prior to the hearing . And it was not the Clarence Thomas whose true views became clear soon after he took his seat . * Thomas ' first opportunity to weigh in on abortion came_in January of 1992 , two months into his tenure , when the court agreed to hear a case from Pennsylvania challenging that state ' s new abortion regulations . The law didn ' t prohibit abortion but required pregnant teen-agers to obtain parental consent , wait 24 hours before undergoing the procedure and , if they were married , to inform their husbands in_advance . Though the case of Planned Parenthood vs . Casey did not require the court to decide the fate of Roe vs . Wade and the right to abortion , and Pennsylvania ' s lawyers urged the court to uphold the regulations as consistent with Roe , it looked_like a suitable vehicle for the court ' s conservatives , who were determined to overturn the abortion right . Three years earlier , in Webster vs . Reproductive Health Services , four members of the court -- Rehnquist , Scalia , Kennedy and Byron White -- had indicated a willingness to reverse Roe vs . Wade . Clarence Thomas could provide the fifth vote . But that majority didn ' t coalesce in the Casey case . Kennedy , citing the importance of precedent and stare decisis , joined an opinion affirming women ' s basic right to choose abortion , and Roe was upheld . As expected , however , Thomas took the other side , signing_on to one dissent by Rehnquist that called_for Roe to be overturned and to a second , more fiery one from Scalia that compared the abortion ruling to the Dred Scott decision , the pre-Civil War era ruling that sanctioned slavery . Pretty strong stuff for someone who had had no views on the_matter just a_few months earlier . Since neither side in the case had argued that Roe vs . Wade should be flatly overturned , Thomas could have filed an opinion upholding the Pennsylvania regulations , but deferring a ruling on the broader question of Roe vs . Wade . According to the scuttlebutt from the court ' s clerks that year , however , no such half-step was even considered in Thomas ' chambers . The justice ' s mind was made_up . &quot; He clearly lied to them ( his confirmation committee ) about legal issues , &quot; says Karlan , the University of Virginia professor . &quot; I think he perjured himself about Roe. &quot; That same term , the issue of prayer in the public_schools returned to the docket . For a decade , lawyers for the Reagan and Bush_administrations had pressed the court to permit more religion in the schools and to stop insisting on such a strict separation of church and state . They had made little progress , but pressed ahead in a case from Rhode Island that arose when a middle-school principal invited a cleric to deliver a prayer at a graduation ceremony . After a Jewish parent complained , a federal judge ruled that the graduation prayer was unconstitutional and could not be repeated . The case of Lee vs . Weisman was appealed_to the high_court when again there was a surprising setback for the conservatives . Thomas did join them once again , but Kennedy switched to the liberal side , and a 5-4 majority upheld the judge ' s ruling , saying that officially sponsored religious invocations have no place in the public_schools . An angry Scalia slammed the decision as as &quot; jurisprudential disaster &quot; and demanded the scrapping of the Lemon test for judging religion cases . Thomas , who had said he had &quot; no quarrel &quot; with the standard a_few months before , signed Scalia ' s dissent . In his first three years on the court , Justice Thomas has rarely had a chance to write a major opinion . Having staked out a position on the far right , he rarely affects the outcome in key cases , except to supply the fifth vote for a conservative majority . He seems less interested in being an influential coalition builder than in forcefully stating his position . So far , his voice has been heard more loudly in political circles than within the confines of the court . So repeatedly , the chief_justice has assigned him to write mundane decisions involving federal jurisdiction or bankruptcy disputes . However , Thomas has strongly asserted himself in two areas of law : prisoners ' rights and voting_rights . Parting company even from conservatives such_as Chief_Justice Rehnquist , Thomas has called_for reversing precedents that have benefited inmates and Southern blacks . Thomas had been_on the bench just two weeks when the court heard a case involving Keith Hudson , an inmate in a Louisiana prison . Late one night , Hudson , locked_in his cell , got_into an argument with a nearby guard , Jack McMillian . Assisted by two other guards , McMillian handcuffed and shackled the prisoner and took him into a hallway . As the others held Hudson , McMillian punched him in the face and jaw and kicked him in the stomach . A supervisor on_duty watched but merely told the guards &quot; not to have too_much fun. &quot; Hudson emerged with a badly swollen face , loosened teeth and a cracked dental plate . Hudson sued the officers in federal_court , alleging he had suffered cruel_and_unusual_punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment . A magistrate concluded that the beating was unrelated to any disciplinary purpose and awarded Hudson $ 800 in damages . On a 7-2 vote , the court upheld the magistrate ' s decision in Hudson vs . McMillian . Justice O ' Connor said prison_guards have broad authority to use all necessary force to enforce discipline or put_down disturbances , but &quot; the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain &quot; violates the Eighth Amendment . Thomas , however , argued that the prisoner ' s injuries were at most &quot; minor &quot; and accused his colleagues of creating &quot; a National Code of Prison Regulation. &quot; His written dissent attracted attention , and not just for its strident conclusion . During his confirmation_hearings , Thomas had displayed a minimal knowledge of constitutional law . He drew_a_blank , for example , when Sen . Patrick Leahy ( D-Vt. ) asked him to name some of the most important high-court rulings of the past 20 years . But his dissent in the Hudson case delved into early English law and quoted a series of precedents from the 19th Century . Around the court , that was seen as a sign that Thomas had turned_over his writing duties to his young clerks . Most justices employ their clerks to do research or write preliminary drafts , but their final opinions tend to reflect their own personal styles . Not so with Thomas . &quot; I don ' t see any distinctive touches , what you might call ' Thomasisms ' in his opinions , &quot; says a veteran attorney who appears regularly before the high_court . The dissent in the prisoner ' s case argued that in the 18th Century , &quot; cruel_and_unusual_punishments &quot; referred to the punishment imposed by a judge . Therefore , the court should limit the Eighth Amendment only to officially imposed punishments and not to &quot; a deprivation suffered in prison. &quot; Of course , if Thomas ' view became the law , prison_guards could use electric_shocks , cattle prods and other means of torture without violating the ban on cruel_and_unusual_punishments . More_than a_few observers remembered how Thomas had , during his confirmation_hearings , told the senators that he could identify with the plight of prisoners . From his courthouse window , he said , he saw &quot; busload after busload &quot; of young_men going_into the jailhouse . Leaning forward intently , he ' d concluded , &quot; I say to myself almost every day , but for the grace of God , there go I. &quot; Scalia , the court ' s liveliest intellect , its most energetic questioner and its best writer , signed Thomas ' dissent , but he later confided to a friend that he did not fully agree with it . Rather , he wanted to protect his embattled new colleague from being &quot; out there all alone. &quot; Twice since then , the court has revisited the issue of prisoners ' rights , and in both instances , Thomas has slammed the majority for adhering to the view that the Constitution forbids cruel_and_unusual_punishment in prison . &quot; Judges or juries , but not jailers , impose punishment , &quot; he wrote in a dissent issued in June . This time , however , Thomas spoke only for himself . Scalia had joined with the majority . * Thomas has stepped boldly into the mine_field of voting-rights law , the controversial area that was the undoing of C . Lani Guinier in her bid to become Clinton ' s attorney_general . Unquestionably , the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has had an enormous impact in the South . Under penalty of that law , Southern officials could no longer use techniques &quot; subtle as well as obvious &quot; to nullify the votes of blacks , and finally , a century after the Civil War , black citizens have gained a voice in government . The reach of the law , however , is uncertain , and Thomas has taken an active role in trying to define it . Some had expected him to show a special sensitivity because of his background , but instead he urged the court to overturn past rulings favoring blacks . One case testing the act ' s limits came_before the court in his first month on the bench . In 1986 , Lawrence Presley became the first black_man in this century to be elected a county commissioner in Etowah County , Ala. , after a judge ordered the county to select its commissioners by district , rather than county-wide . Presley won a seat in a new black-majority district , and the post was a powerful one , since each commissioner also controlled the budget_for road maintenance in his section of the county . Soon after Presley was elected , however , the new county council voted to put all road decisions in the hands of the whole commission . With one stroke , the white majority had regained all power . Presley sued , contending that this move to strip him of power violated the Voting Rights Act . But on a 6-3 vote , the Supreme Court rejected the claim in Presley vs . Etowah County . &quot; This is a case where a_few pages of history are far more illuminating than volumes of logic , &quot; John Paul Stevens wrote for the three dissenters . Congress wanted to end schemes used to deprive blacks of political power , so the court should enforce the will of Congress , not thwart it , he said . But writing for a conservative majority , Justice Kennedy said the 1965 law applies only &quot; with_respect_to voting , &quot; not to &quot; routine actions of state and local governments. &quot; Thomas joined his opinion . Alice Presley told Emerge magazine that her husband had , in the tumultuous days of Thomas ' confirmation , believed that because of his background , &quot; we ought to give the guy a chance. &quot; But after the 1992 ruling , Presley , who died in January , 1993 , realized he had made a mistake . &quot; That really hurt him more_than the decision . He would walk_around saying , ' I can ' t believe Thomas voted against me , ' &quot; Alice Presley said . Last year , Thomas cast the deciding fifth vote to rule that drawing congressional boundaries solely to create black-majority districts violated the constitutional rights of whites . And this year , Thomas went even further and disputed the entire 25-year history of using the Voting Rights Act to help elect more blacks in the South . The issue arose in an unusual case from rural Bleckley County , Ga. , where all power is exercised by a single county commissioner who acts_as both executive and legislature . Blacks , who make_up 20 % of the population , said they were excluded from power and filed a suit under the Voting Rights Act . The U.S. Court of Appeals , relying_on Congress ' 1982 amendments to the voting_rights law , agreed with the black voters and ordered the county to switch to a five-member commission . Those amendments underlined that any &quot; standard , practice or procedure &quot; used in the electoral process would violate the law if it denied racial and ethnic minorities the right &quot; to elect representatives of their choice. &quot; If a large black or Latino population is denied representation because of the way district boundaries are drawn , those lines are illegal , even if they were not intended to discriminate . Minorities are not guaranteed proportional_representation , but the law tells judges they must examine &quot; the extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the state or political subdivision. &quot; On the high_court , the justices voted 5 to 4 to overturn the appeals court and uphold Bleckley County ' s single commissioner system . Why ? Three members of the majority -- Kennedy , Rehnquist and O ' Connor -- said the courts can ' t decide the size of a governing body because there is no &quot; benchmark &quot; for deciding what is fair . If Bleckley would need five commissioners to give blacks a voice , should the next county have 20 commissioners so it could serve a group with 5 % of the population ? they asked . But Thomas , in a 59-page separate opinion , took the view that the Voting Rights Act does not cover the make-up of governing boards and the drawing of electoral boundaries , no matter what their effect on minorities . He said he would reject 25 years of court precedent on the issue and ignore what Congress has said on the subject . His broad arguments , though familiar , have a certain power . The law as currently interpreted &quot; encourages federal_courts to segregate voters into racially designated districts . . . . In doing so , we have collaborated in what may aptly be termed the racial Balkanization of the nation , &quot; he wrote . Wall_Street Journal columnist Paul Gigot called his opinion , which Scalia joined , an &quot; intellectual bombshell &quot; and a &quot; tour de force. &quot; This is Thomas at his best , arguing that there is a price to pay_for elevating race as the all-important factor_in politics and the law . But Thomas ' view of the law has one obvious drawback : Congress does not agree with him . As Justice Stevens pointed_out in an opinion joined by Souter , Ginsburg and Blackmun , it is &quot; crystal_clear &quot; that Congress wrote the law to apply to voting districts that denied minorities the right &quot; to elect representatives of their choice. &quot; Sen . Specter , who had closely questioned Thomas to seek assurance that the nominee would abide_by long-standing interpretations of federal civil_rights law , heard Thomas give the desired assurances . &quot; If there is a longstanding interpretation and Congress does not act . . . that certainly would be , at least from my way of looking_at a statute , evidence that cannot be ignored in revisiting that particular statute , &quot; he told Specter . But that was just the kind of longstanding interpretation of the voting-rights law that Thomas ignored in June . * While no one has proved whether Thomas told the truth when he &quot; categorically denied &quot; all_of Anita Hill ' s accusations , there is ample reason to believe that he did not honestly describe his legal views in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee . that ' s not a problem in the eyes of those who strongly supported Thomas from the beginning . &quot; I think he is proving to be an excellent justice , &quot; says Charles Cooper , the former Reagan_Administration lawyer . C . Boyden Gray , White_House counsel under George_Bush , praises Thomas ' opinions on voting_rights and the prisoners ' cases as &quot; gutsy , not politically correct . I think he ' s doing a great job . He ' s been just what I had hoped for , &quot; Gray says . Danforth says he has paid little attention to his performance on the court . &quot; I stood_by him as a friend , &quot; he replies . &quot; I ' m not a critic. &quot; But disappointment and anger are strong in other circles . Ralph Neas , the executive_director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights , concludes that Thomas has been exactly what he feared . &quot; We opposed him because we thought he would be a right-wing ideologue , and that ' s what he ' s been , &quot; Neas says . Before , Scalia had been generally seen as the court ' s most conservative justice , and Thomas has voted with him in 86 % of the cases . It is the closest pairing of justices since the liberal tandem of William J . Brennan and Thurgood Marshall retired . Harsh criticism has come from blacks . Last November , Emerge magazine , which appeals_to black professionals , published a scathing attack on Thomas titled &quot; Betrayed &quot; in which several black Republicans who supported Thomas three years ago said they now regret having done so . Film director Spike Lee commented that &quot; Malcolm X , if he were alive today , would call Thomas a handkerchief head , a chicken-and-biscuit-eating Uncle Tom. &quot; The magazine ' s cover featured a photo of Thomas with his head wrapped in a handkerchief . Reactions to Thomas differ so sharply in part because his friends indeed see a different person . Consider these two stories : Sen . Danforth calls Thomas &quot; warm , pleasant , funny , inspiring , just a delightful person to be with. &quot; To illustrate , he cites his summer interns , who expressed an interest in seeing the Supreme Court . &quot; I called Clarence , and he had them come_over the next day . He took time with every one of them . The personal warmth just comes_through . that ' s the real Clarence Thomas , &quot; the senator says . William L . Robinson , dean of the District_of_Columbia School_of_Law , also wanted to bring some young students by the Supreme Court . A black civil_rights lawyer who knew Thomas from his EEOC days , Robinson considered the justice a friend , even if they disagreed on the law . &quot; It would really mean a lot to these kids if they could see someone like him ( Thomas ) who made_it . I just hoped he would duck his head in the room and maybe say ' hello ' while we were there , &quot; Robinson says . He called Thomas ' s chambers repeatedly , explained why he was calling and left messages . &quot; He would n ' t even call me back . And I guess I ' m pissed about it now , &quot; Robinson says . that ' s the real Clarence Thomas , too . A more confident Thomas was_on display this spring as the justice showed a new willingness to get outside the court . He gave talks at his high_school and college alma_maters , discussed crime before the Federalist Society , spoke_to judges in New York and Baltimore , dropped_by uninvited to chat with the disc_jockeys at a local &quot; oldies &quot; radio_station and even donned a football jersey and visited the practice field of his favorite team , the Dallas Cowboys . Why the Cowboys ? Because the local Redskins are hugely popular in Washington and their arch-rival , the Cowboys , are generally hated , he explains . He also says he likes the Los Angeles Raiders &quot; because everybody hates them. &quot; His Federalist Society speech on crime was powerful and provocative , sounding like the Thomas of old . He blamed the &quot; rights revolution , &quot; promoted by 1960s-era liberals , for much of the crime and mayhem that besets America ' s cities today . It ' s a view gaining increasing currency in Republican circles . One thing seems certain . Justice Thomas and the controversy that follows him figure to be with us for many years to come . This fall , two new books on his confirmation fight are_due to be published . Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson of the Wall_Street Journal take a critical look in &quot; Strange Justice : The Selling of Clarence Thomas. &quot; The authors are not promising a &quot; smoking gun &quot; about sexual_harassment , but they do say that the Bush White_House deliberately painted a misleading picture of Thomas . Meanwhile , Danforth gives an insider ' s account of the 10-day fight to save his friend ' s nomination in a book entitled , &quot; Resurrection : The Confirmation of Clarence Thomas. &quot; Danforth , according to an account in Washingtonian magazine , describes how Thomas ' nomination was saved by a quick prayer session in the moments before Thomas presented his final defense . Thomas , his wife , Virginia , and Danforth , along with Danforth ' s wife , Sally , met in the restroom of Danforth ' s office , the story goes , praying and listening to a recording of &quot; Onward Christian Soldiers. &quot; &quot; We reached_out to each other and held hands as we listened : ' Onward Christian soldiers , marching as_to war. ' I looked_at Clarence . His eyes were closed , his head bowed ; his foot beat time to the music. &quot; &quot; An effective criminal justice system -- one that holds people accountable for harmful conduct -- simply cannot be sustained under conditions where there are boundless excuses for violent behavior and no moral authority for the state to punish , &quot; Thomas said . He ticked_off the modern-day explanations for crime -- &quot; poverty , substandard education , faltering families , unemployment , systemic racism &quot; -- but none of them can excuse an individual ' s wrongdoing , he said . While he offered no precise recommendations for what can be done , his message about crime and personal responsibility seems sure to win broad approval . As for the 46-year-old Thomas , he tells almost every audience that he is &quot; getting comfortable &quot; being a justice and is settling in_for a long stay . &quot; It ' s a joy to work_at the court , &quot; he told a meeting of federal judges in New York . &quot; And in good_health , I hope to be there for another four decades or more. &quot;</TEXT>
