   <HEADLINE> U.S. VOWS MAJOR CUT IN HOMELESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry G . Cisneros unveiled a new federal effort to combat homelessness Tuesday and pledged that the Clinton_Administration will reduce the number of homeless Americans by one-third before the end of its first term . In a report by Cisneros ' department that was a year in the making , the Administration contended that on any night , 600 # 000 of the nation ' s people are among the ranks of the homeless and that 7 million people were without a permanent residence at some point between 1985 and 1990 . The Administration vowed in its report to take a new approach to the problem by giving local_governments more responsibility for creating comprehensive programs designed to establish emergency housing and to treat substance_abuse , mental_illness and other problems believed to be at the root of homelessness . The report ' s release Tuesday coincided with the Administration ' s attempts to push legislation for a variety of programs through Congress and was designed to help defend its proposal to double federal funding for homelessness programs to $ 1.7 billion in 1995 . Homeless advocates applauded the report as the first federal acknowledgment of the extent and complexity of homelessness in the United States . But they cautioned that even the resources being contemplated by the Clinton_Administration would be dwarfed by the need . &quot; It ' s doomed to disappoint because for the first time the federal_government understands the problem and because of political reasons it cannot respond at the level necessary , &quot; said Fred Karnas , executive_director of the National Coalition for the Homeless , which represents homeless advocates in 40 cities . Louisville , Ky. , Mayor Jerry Abramson , president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors , said that the report marks the first time the White_House has responded to the mounting demand for services for the homeless . &quot; Each year we appealed_to the federal_government to intervene , to help cities and service providers keep pace with the alarming growth of the problem , &quot; Abramson said . &quot; The response during those years came largely from Capitol_Hill , not the White House. &quot; Traditionally , the federal_government has granted money on a competitive basis to nonprofit organizations with the expectation that they would provide emergency shelter and services to the homeless . But the Administration argues that the problem is too intractable to be alleviated in such piecemeal fashion and must be addressed through coordinated , comprehensive public policy headed by local_government with guidance from federal_officials . While responses will certainly vary from city to city , depending_on the extent of the problem , each would be expected to use the federal funds to provide : * Emergency shelter . * Transitional and rehabilitative services , including substance_abuse treatment , short-term mental_health services and independent living skills instruction . * Permanent affordable housing . &quot; This comprehensive approach to homelessness should be instituted and coordinated by localities , &quot; the report says . &quot; Unlike not-for-profit providers , the locality can view the entire system in the jurisdiction to ensure that transitions from each stage can be smooth . Unlike the federal_government , the locality is intimately familiar_with the needs of its neighborhoods. &quot; The Administration has been working with the District_of_Columbia -- the first municipality awarded a special $ 20-million grant to create a model approach to homelessness -- since soon after President Clinton took_office . Los Angeles , the second winner of a pilot grant , is drafting its final proposal on how it will use the $ 20 million it is scheduled to receive . Other cities qualifying for pilot_programs have yet to be announced .</TEXT>
