   <HEADLINE> CANCER PROGRAM HEAD IS PREVENTION PIONEER ; MEDICINE : DR . FRANK MEYSKENS HAS MADE UCI A LEADER IN AN EMERGING FIELD OF RESEARCH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ahead of his time a decade ago when he studied the cancer preventive powers of vitamin A , Dr. Frank L . Meyskens Jr . remembers with mischievous delight a talk he gave_back then to a group of cancer therapists . &quot; At the end of the talk , one guy in all innocence says , ' You ' re doing this prevention stuff until we have a cure , right ? ' &quot; he recalled . &quot; I said , ' No , wrong . My intention is to put you out of business. ' &quot; Now the head of UC Irvine ' s cancer program , the 48-year-old Meyskens has made the university a leader in the emerging field of cancer prevention research . Dr. Peter Greenwald , director of cancer prevention and control at the National Cancer Institute in Maryland , calls Meyskens &quot; a real visionary &quot; who has risked the less traveled road . While mainline medicine was using toxic chemotherapy to treat cancer , Meyskens bet his scientific reputation that more benign chemicals -- some naturally occurring like vitamin A -- might prevent cancer by stopping or reversing molecular changes that lead to the disease . His faith in chemoprevention has begun to be confirmed by research studies . Most recently , the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in April published the results of a 15-year study , of which Meyskens was the principal author , that showed a drug similar to vitamin A can reverse precancerous conditions of the cervix . But last week , Meyskens ' scientific acclaim was overshadowed by news that , under his leadership , UCI is_on the verge of obtaining special recognition by the National Cancer Institute that would make_it one of the top five cancer centers in Southern California . By summer ' s end , UCI will probably become an NCI &quot; clinical cancer center , &quot; a designation that may bring_up to $ 2.4 million in federal grant money to the university over three years and enable it to attract more cancer researchers , physicians and patients seeking state-of-the-art medicine . The prestigious designation is a necessary step toward UCI ' s ultimate goal of becoming an NCI &quot; comprehensive cancer center , &quot; which would give it even loftier status among scientists . A workaholic who needs little sleep , he works some 70 hours a week on his multifaceted job , according to his staff , dividing his time between administrative tasks , teaching , research and patients . Meyskens , who rises at 4 a.m. , confesses to having slowed his pace a tad since a sudden attack of diabetes last summer sent him to the intensive care unit at UCI Medical_Center . After that scare , he started taking insulin , monitoring his sugar level and wearing a medic alert bracelet . The bulk of the credit for UCI ' s fast track admission to the NCI cancer pantheon goes_to Meyskens , who was recruited from the University of Arizona five years ago to develop an NCI-class cancer center , colleagues say . Despite the plaudits , Carol Schwartz , Meyskens ' secretary , said that when friends stop to congratulate him , he refuses the compliments . &quot; He is one of the most humble individuals I have seen in my life , &quot; she said . And his preoccupation with intellectual pursuits and lack of pretentiousness , friends say , are evidenced by his rumpled look . Meyskens , who earns $ 250 # 000 a year at UCI , attributes his inattention to clothes to his blue-collar background as &quot; the son of a plumber. &quot; By contrast , friends say , his mind is sharp and he has a voracious appetite for scientific reading . &quot; Only a handful of people in the country know as much about cancer prevention , &quot; said Dr. Thomas Ahlering , a urological oncologist whom Meyskens recruited to UCI from the City of Hope National Medical_Center . &quot; He is not driven by fame or finances . He seems driven by the scientific endeavor. &quot; Meyskens has the rare ability to communicate as clearly to a scientific gathering as_to a group of Leisure World retirees , Schwartz said . Similarly , Meyskens speaks the professional lingos of both medicine and basic research , a skill that has helped him bridge the gap that once separated UCI physicians from scientists . Retreats have been his favorite tools to bring the two groups together to share ideas . &quot; He encouraged people to talk and work together , to become a center , &quot; said Hoda Anton-Culver , director of cancer epidemiology intervention , a component of the center . &quot; Before , each investigator worked by himself. &quot; Such cooperation was important to gaining recognition from the NCI , which insists that its centers develop interdisciplinary research programs that transfer laboratory research into clinical trials . When Meyskens arrived_at UCI , he found that basic biological and molecular research was strong but clinical research was not a high priority for its physicians . That is changing . While clinicians were receiving only $ 192 # 000 a year in research grants five years ago , they are now garnering about $ 2 million a year . The campus now has one of the nation ' s most ambitious clinical cancer research programs in chemoprevention , studying how chemicals -- such_as vitamin A , beta carotene and tamoxifen -- protect people at high risk for various forms of cancer . He also recruited leading research talent to UCI . Among the biggest coups were Ahlering , Dr. Jeffrey Webber , formerly a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute , and Dr. Paul Zeltzer , a pediatric oncologist from UCLA . Meyskens also promoted fund-raising to support the cancer program , which has raised $ 26 million , the most since he arrived . &quot; He wanted to increase the visibility of the cancer program in the community , &quot; said Ann Siemens , the cancer program ' s director of development . &quot; He got our doctors , nurses and basic researchers talking to traditional donors and even patients who became donors. &quot; All this was done with little fanfare by the unassuming man who hung the sign &quot; grantmaster , &quot; a present from his three children , inside his office door so it would not offend anyone . &quot; As a director , you really have to bury your ego as much as possible and put everyone else out front , &quot; he said . Meyskens became interested in medicine as a child , having been born with an incapacitating brain disorder that caused him to suffer severe seizures . &quot; I spent a good portion of my life between the ages of 3 and 10 in the hospital , &quot; he said . &quot; My earliest_childhood memory was sitting in bed with all these white coats around me with my mother crying in the corner. &quot; Meyskens ultimately outgrew this medical problem , but the confinement encouraged him to turn_to books and science . He attended UC San Francisco Medical_School and during a 1968 summer job at the University of Cambridge met Francis Crick , a co-discoverer of DNA . The relationship ignited his interest in microbiology . After training at the National Cancer Institute , he took a position at the University of Arizona in 1977 , where he organized cancer prevention studies . He also played a role in that school ' s developing its NCI cancer center in the 1980s . Best known for his research in the last 15 years into melanoma and chemoprevention of cancer , Meyskens traces those interests to his father ' s eye cancer . After diagnosing melanoma in his father , he began reading reports of laboratory experiments using vitamin A derivatives to treat the disease . Dr. Philip DiSaia , who helped to recruit Meyskens to UCI , said Meyskens ' background suited him to the task of building another NCI cancer center . Moreover , he felt Meyskens ' focus_on cancer prevention is a better approach to the disease . This is &quot; the new road , &quot; DiSaia said . &quot; We have been struggling 34 years trying to kill cancers once they are established and have been only moderately successful . Seems to me it is a lot more logical to try to prevent them. &quot;</TEXT>
