   <HEADLINE> PLO AND ISRAEL AGREE TO RESUME SELF-RULE TALKS ; MIDEAST : NEGOTIATORS BREAK IMPASSE AFTER RESOLVING SECURITY QUESTIONS IN HEBRON , SITE OF MOSQUE MASSACRE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After agreeing on interim security arrangements for the West_Bank city of Hebron in a nine-hour bargaining session , Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization announced early today that they will restart formal negotiations on Palestinian autonomy . The announcements broke a five-week deadlock that began when a Jewish settler massacred about 30 Palestinian worshipers in Hebron on Feb . 25 . The two sides issued brief statements announcing that the heads of their delegations will sign the Hebron agreement here this morning and that talks on implementing the long-delayed Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho will begin later in the day . &quot; The head of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations , Maj . Gen . Amnon Lipkin Shahak , announces that after midnight an agreement was reached between the Israeli and Palestinian delegations on the issue of security arrangements in Hebron , &quot; said the Israeli statement , released by an army spokesman . Labeling the agreement &quot; a compromise formula , &quot; Israel Radio reported today that PLO negotiators agreed to give_up demands for a Palestinian police_force in Hebron in exchange for a larger international observer force than Israel had originally been willing to permit . Quoting Nabil Shaath , chief delegate for the PLO , the Voice of Israel said that , under the compromise , the international force would include 150 military observers from several European_nations and that they would be armed . Shaath emerged briefly from the hotel_room where he has been negotiating with Shahak , Israel ' s deputy chief_of_staff , to confirm the agreement . &quot; We have agreed on security in Hebron and on the resumption of talks on Gaza-Jericho , &quot; said Shaath , who added that he would provide details of the agreement later in the day . &quot; I am completely exhausted , &quot; he said . President Clinton said the agreement means the Middle_East peace process is back on track . &quot; It ' s very , very encouraging to me , and I hope it will be to all_the American people , &quot; he told reporters Wednesday outside the San Diego seaside manor where he is spending a week on vacation . The agreement on Hebron was the key to resuming what both sides had predicted will be accelerated negotiations to implement Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho along with an Israeli troop withdrawal that was to have been completed by April 13 . Negotiators had made halting progress through the night Wednesday after two weeks of informal , face-to-face talks aimed at boosting security for Palestinians in the city where the massacre took_place . Earlier , PLO sources said up_to 100 Palestinian police also would be assigned in Hebron . As the negotiations in Cairo went_on , clashes continued to leave dead and wounded Palestinians in Gaza and the West_Bank . Israel has insisted on maintaining overall security control in Hebron , calling_for Palestinian police to remain under Israeli command , although it has reportedly agreed that Palestinians on joint patrols with Israelis would travel in separate vehicles . Israeli negotiators also have refused to allow anything more_than personal pistols as arms for the Arab police . And while Israel ' s negotiators agreed to the idea of lightly armed international observers , up until Wednesday night they opposed anything but Norwegian , Finnish and Danish troops on the international force . Meantime , by Wednesday , negotiators made progress on several other key security points . For example , PLO sources said Israel agreed to allow the deployment of up_to 10 # 000 Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho , up from its previous limit of 8 # 500 officers , a key stumbling_block in the self-rule talks since October . The Israelis also reportedly agreed to allow the PLO to appoint the governor of Hebron . As the Israeli-PLO talks continued in Cairo on Wednesday , Israel ' s military command took extreme steps_in the occupied territories to prevent a fresh outbreak of widespread violence after Tuesday ' s storm of protests against the shooting deaths of six of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ' s activists in the Gaza Strip . New military orders calling_for restraint by Israeli soldiers in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip were issued to minimize clashes , and strict curfews were clamped on more_than two_dozen towns -- Hebron among them . The curfews confined more_than 300 # 000 Palestinians to their homes . Despite the curfews , an 18-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed after he stoned an Israeli car near the West_Bank town of Nablus . Palestinian sources blamed the shooting on a Jewish settler , who they said fired on a group of Palestinian youths by the roadside . An army spokesman said the incident is under investigation . There were also reports of five more Palestinians wounded during clashes with Israeli security_forces in Hebron , where violence has erupted routinely in spite of almost constant curfews in the past month . But , on a day of traditional Arab protest , the Israeli military ' s strategy appeared to have kept most of the occupied lands tense but largely peaceful after a day of violent demonstrations left one Arab dead and more_than 75 wounded . General strikes and annual protest rallies unrelated to the troubled peace process also shut_down East Jerusalem and most Arab towns inside Israel as well , as Israel ' s 850 # 000 Arab citizens staged demonstrations to commemorate Land Day . On that day in 1976 , Israeli soldiers and police killed six Arabs protesting the confiscation of Arab lands in the Galilee region . The Land Day demonstrations passed peacefully after Israeli authorities , fearing widespread Arab unrest , agreed not to enter any of the Arab towns within Israel or intervene in the rallies . But anger seethed in Hebron . So did fears about a protest_march scheduled for today by Jewish extremists and Israel ' s political right_wing . The protest_march is to take_place in Kiryat Arba , the home of Baruch Goldstein -- the Brooklyn-born doctor involved in the Hebron mosque massacre -- and his family and friends . The settlers and the nation ' s right-wing leaders organized their protest as a warning to Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin that there will be a backlash of civil_disobedience if he attempts to relocate the 415 Jewish settlers in Hebron -- a key demand of Arafat ' s negotiating team . On Wednesday , Israeli military authorities also sought to defend the actions of the undercover army_unit in Gaza against a series of allegations and unanswered questions surrounding Monday night ' s shooting in Gaza . In the face of continuing criticism that the undercover officers opened_fire on the Fatah activists without provocation and without attempting first to identify or arrest their targets , army spokesmen and Defense Ministry officials said the undercover squad had no time to do so . Acting under orders that still permit security_forces to shoot at any armed Palestinians who present a potential threat in the territories , the undercover squad was fully justified in opening fire on six masked men wearing camouflage uniforms and bearing arms , the officials said . They added that the army regretted that the squad had killed six of the activists who will be needed to help integrate the future Palestinian police_force into the territories . One senior military_officer in Gaza said the army will now work toward establishing a &quot; hot_line &quot; to coordinate with Fatah in the future . As a result of the shootings , reports in Israel ' s Hebrew press said that Israeli commanders did issue new orders for all security_forces in the territories to refrain_from confrontations and to limit clashes in the coming days . Still , there was continuing criticism of the operation from the Israeli human-rights group_B ' tselem , which confirmed eyewitness accounts that at least one of the six men was killed in cold blood after he was wounded . And Israeli Communications Minister Shulamit Aloni , leader of the left-wing Meretz faction in Rabin ' s ruling coalition , called_for the army to suspend its hunt for armed activists from all Palestinian parties in the Gaza Strip . Murphy reported from Cairo and Fineman from Jerusalem .</TEXT>
