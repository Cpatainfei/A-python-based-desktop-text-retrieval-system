   <TEXT> In the antiseptic parlance of public health_professionals , Amarwati is a &quot; commercial sex worker &quot; and potential &quot; vector &quot; for AIDS . Two or three times a day , the 21-year-old woman with black curly hair and a nervous smile brings men into her modest home with stained yellow walls , and steers them toward a hard wood-frame bed . As a fan overhead whips the warm air , she and her clients have_sex . She earns $ 2 to $ 3 daily . Amarwati , who has an 8-year-old daughter , is not unusual . So many women in her district of this lowland town in midwestern Nepal are prostitutes that a patch of dusty ground across from their homes seems , like a freakish garden drawn by Salvador Dali , to have bloomed with a crop of used , shriveled condoms . Amarwati and her neighbors are among the reasons that officials in this small landlocked kingdom , renowned for its snowy Himalayan vistas and exotic culture , are now bracing for the onslaught of the human_immunodeficiency_virus , which causes AIDS . &quot; All symptoms point to the fact that when HIV begins to spread with velocity here , it will explode , &quot; said Dr. Daniel Tarantola , director of the International AIDS Program at the Harvard School of Public Health ' s Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center . Nepal ' s looming crisis is part of a general , alarming trend . Last winter , the number of HIV-infected people in south and southeastern Asia overtook the total of infected people in the industrialized world for the first time , according to a study published this year by Harvard ' s Global AIDS Policy Coalition . Judging by available evidence , the study concluded , the number of people who are infected yearly with HIV has begun to decline everywhere -- except in Asia . The trauma and challenges of AIDS , whose first cases were recognized among gay American men in 1981 , are unfortunately not new . But as health_professionals are learning , dealing with HIV as it speeds through previously uncontaminated societies requires much more_than duplicating approaches used in the United States , Africa or elsewhere . Take Amarwati . Since she was 12 and her family desperately needed money , she says , she has been engaging in prostitution . Her mother did too , she says . Both women belong_to the Badis , a branch of the despised Hindu caste known as the Untouchables . Badi women have traditionally sold their bodies . An estimated 15 # 000 to 16 # 000 members of the subcaste live_in Nepal , and 40 % of their households contain at least one woman engaging in the sex trade , experts say . Each sex worker may support up_to eight family members . With an entire community dependent_on prostitution for much , if not most , of its income , eliminating Badi women as potential HIV vectors , or carriers , is difficult . Handing out more_than 7 # 000 condoms each month to the prostitutes and teaching them and customers how to use them with cartoons on a flip_chart , as the grass-roots Social Awareness for Education ( SAFE ) does_in Nepalganj , is just a start . &quot; Our purpose is also to supply an alternative profession for the Badi people , &quot; SAFE leader Dilip Pariyar said . It ' s a mighty , uphill struggle , and one emblematic of the social changes that specialists like Tarantola , a garrulous , charming Frenchman who received a prestigious Albert Schweitzer Award for his achievements in public health , say must be made in tradition-bound Nepalese society if AIDS is not to spread like wildfire . In this beautiful but impoverished land , where the average annual income is $ 165 , the economic lure of prostitution is strong , especially if a woman knows no other trade . In many villages , it is assumed that any hut that has a tin roof instead of a thatch one houses a prostitute who can afford the more expensive covering . Many Nepalese , reared in the traditional Hindu value system that regards each caste as fit for only one type of labor , have a difficult time imagining Badi women engaged in anything but sex for hire . That is one reason that SAFE has opened a hostel in Nepalganj for 22 Badi girls , ages 8 to 17 . The youngsters , freshly scrubbed and wearing white smocks , used to live at_home , but relatives who wanted to act_as their pimps -- as well as hopeful clients -- would n ' t stop soliciting them , Pariyar said . The Badis represent only a single aspect , albeit a unique one , of the challenges facing Nepalese and foreign organizations wrestling with the AIDS crisis here . By some estimates , a staggering 200 # 000 Nepali women are employed in brothels in India . Some went willingly , while others were duped by brokers who bought them from their parents . This Indian sex trade may represent the greatest potential AIDS carrier of all . In Bombay , where an estimated 60 # 000 Nepalese women toil in the brothels , nearly 45 % of prostitutes have tested HIV-positive . What will happen when these Nepali women return home , often to isolated mountain hamlets where there is no AIDS testing ? And what of their clients ? An estimated 90 # 000 Nepalese men work in Bombay , and a fact-finding mission this year by Nepalese women ' s organizations to 50 Indian brothels found that a Nepalese prostitute , on average , &quot; entertained &quot; four or five countrymen every day . &quot; These men then come_home to their wives and families , &quot; said Dr. Renu Rajbhandari , executive_director of the Women ' s Rehabilitation Center in Katmandu , the capital . &quot; And we don ' t know how much HIV they are bringing back. &quot; The cross-border trade_in prostitutes , most of whom are taken_to India when they are 12 or 13 and treated as sex slaves , could have devastating consequences for the Tamangs and other hill tribes of central Nepal , whose women and girls are particularly prized by men in India and other parts of Nepal for their docility and gentleness . &quot; From Nuwakot , the girls go because they need money . They don ' t have anything else , &quot; Rajbhandari said . In the villages of another central district , &quot; you can ' t find a young_woman , &quot; she added . &quot; They are all_in Bombay. &quot; To minimize the women ' s risk of contracting HIV or venereal_disease , the Women ' s Rehabilitation Center has hired half_a_dozen Bombay prostitutes to work as &quot; peer counselors &quot; in the brothels , responsible_for explaining the hows and whys of AIDS and condoms , which many Nepalese have never seen . &quot; We can ' t say , ' Don ' t do prostitution , ' &quot; Rajbhandari said . &quot; This is not our right . We say , ' Have safer sex. ' &quot; But with as_many as an estimated 90 % of the girls from some villages in Sindhupalchok , north of Katmandu , engaging in prostitution , the Women ' s Rehabilitation Center is also trying to promote alternative income projects , like bamboo crafts , to break the economic logic that causes many women to opt_for or be ensnared in the sex business . &quot; If they can earn 700 rupees ( about $ 15 ) per month , they won ' t go_to Bombay , &quot; Rajbhandari said . At WRC headquarters , 15 girls and young_women make a living knitting sweaters , which a middleman buys for $ 5 apiece for shipment to Germany . One star knitter is Gita , 28 , who was sold into prostitution by her cousin , but who had to return to Nepal from Bombay when a blood_test showed she is HIV-positive . Now sometimes brooding and temperamental , Gita says she has a lover and wants to get_married . As in sub-Saharan African_countries , poverty is a contributing factor to the spread of AIDS here . Dr. Benu B . Karki is chief of the Nepalese government ' s National AIDS Prevention and Control Project . He has a staff of 15 and an annual budget of $ 300 # 000 for a nation of about 20 million people . &quot; Raising awareness is the only strategy that we have in the AIDS program , &quot; the harried doctor said . &quot; I don ' t have any regional , district or village staff. &quot; Nepal ' s conservative Hindu mores also complicate the anti-AIDS campaign : Outside of marriage , people generally don ' t talk_about sex . A woman is not deemed a man ' s equal and has little or no control over her sex life . And in a country where 74 % of adults are illiterate , prudery and ignorance seem to reinforce themselves . &quot; If you want to examine a person ' s private parts , either they refuse , or they leave the doctor ' s office , &quot; Karki said . &quot; We really don ' t find_out about some people ( AIDS victims ) until they die. &quot; The first_AIDS case in Nepal was diagnosed in July , 1988 . Today , Health Ministry statistics say 100 men and 102 women have been found to be HIV-positive . Thirty of them have developed AIDS , and 15 have died . Extrapolating from those numbers , the ministry estimates there are 6 # 000 HIV carriers in the country . But Karki admitted , &quot; We really don ' t know the situation. &quot; Other potential AIDS carriers include about 350 # 000 Nepalese who head to India each year in search of work . &quot; They are uneducated and don ' t even know what a condom is , &quot; Karki said . In the other direction , an estimated 2 million truck_drivers , farm_workers and other Indians flock annually to Nepal , where they often patronize prostitutes . To supplement the government ' s modest anti-AIDS effort , a number of local and foreign charities and nonprofit organizations have stepped_in . AmFAR , the American Foundation for AIDS Research chaired by actress Elizabeth Taylor , began funding 17 prevention programs in Nepal in October and says it will pump more_than $ 600 # 000 in grants and technical assistance into the country annually for three years . &quot; Our strategy is to go_to countries with low incidence of HIV , but where there is danger of rapid_growth , &quot; said the Rev . Margaret R . Reinfeld , an Episcopal priest who is AmFAR ' s director of education and international programs . &quot; We try to encourage community responses in ways appropriate for those countries , and not import ready-made solutions. &quot; This has taken the anti-AIDS message in some strange directions that do not always meet with full approval from the American donors . This summer , members of an AmFAR delegation cringed as one of Nepal ' s oldest social-service organizations , Agroforestry , Basic Health &amp; Cooperatives Nepal , distributed brochures at a Bhaktapur elementary_school that were intended to inform children about AIDS . The leaflets contained graphic , colorful photographs of sores and other symptoms . Although the youngsters eagerly scrutinized the pictures and listened politely to the teacher , some clearly didn ' t understand the significance of the lesson . &quot; But why do we need a sexual partner ? &quot; one asked . Funded wholly or in part by AmFAR , social_workers now cruise Katmandu ' s &quot; Freak Street , &quot; a rendezvous made famous by Western hippies of the 1960s , and exchange needles used by some of Nepal ' s officially estimated 25 # 000 intravenous drug_users , most of whom shoot low-grade heroin . At the country ' s biggest cracker factory , a traveling lecture session and burlesque street show in June told workers and neighbors about AIDS . There was even a how-to lesson on condoms that erupted into general hilarity when a hapless male assistant inadvertently launched the condom into the air . In Nepal , the anti-AIDS message is being preached by community organizations that , in addition , promote growing leafy green vegetables to reduce Vitamin_A deficiency , goat husbandry as a means to financial independence and the buying up of land to distribute to impoverished tribes or castes . There seems to be a clear danger that information about AIDS will be drowned_out by other items on the agenda . But Tarantola insists that this community-based approach is the only effective strategy . And though some anti-AIDS measures may seem to have little in common with , say , the activities of the Gay_Men ' s Health Crisis , the root logic , Tarantola said , is identical . &quot; I suggest that wherever discrimination exists . . . this is probably where the highest vulnerability for HIV is , &quot; said Tarantola , scientific editor of the voluminous &quot; AIDS in the World &quot; study . &quot; You can correlate marginalization with vulnerability. &quot; In Nepal , &quot; marginalization &quot; means the situation of groups like the Badi . It is too early to foretell the fate of Amarwati and her neighbors . One recent study found that 70 % of Badi sex workers suffered from syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases , but HIV apparently has not yet made significant inroads . So perhaps the Daliesque landscape of castaway condoms in Nepalganj ' s Badi ghetto is a sign of hope . As a result of advice from SAFE ' s health workers , Amarwati says , for the past 12 months she has insisted that her clients use a condom . If necessary , she can provide one . &quot; If they use a condom , they get_it , &quot; the Badi woman said matter-of-factly . &quot; If they don ' t , they don ' t . It ' s my health. &quot;</TEXT>
