   <HEADLINE> NO QUICK ACTION BY PARLIAMENT ON AMNESTY SEEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Passage of an amnesty for Haiti ' s military , a key part of the agreement for the resignation and removal of the Caribbean nation ' s military_leaders , will be troubled at the very least , Haitian observers said Sunday night . Any expectation of quick action by the Haitian Parliament is likely to be frustrated , they said , by the complexities of Haitian politics both before and after the ouster of democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . The accord negotiated by President Clinton ' s three emissaries calls_for Haitian military commander Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , chief_of_staff Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby and the Port-au-Prince police_chief , Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois , to give_up power when an amnesty law is passed , or on Oct . 15 , whichever comes first . Supporters of the military regime predicted Sunday that the_matter would be pushed to the Oct . 15 deadline . &quot; The Americans may_not be in danger , but we could drive them crazy with frustration , &quot; said one Haitian opponent of Aristide . &quot; It ' ll take the Americans ordering Cedras and Biamby to leave on Oct . 15 , and that will prove that this is an occupation. &quot; &quot; This amnesty business is going_to make the Americans look_like fools , &quot; said another Haitian political source after the agreement was announced . &quot; They think Aristide ' s return will mean democracy . It looks_to me like the Americans are going_to have to carry this thing out right to Oct . 15. &quot; One problem will be that Haiti has two rival Senates . There is the Senate that existed before the military-led coup that ousted Aristide on Sept . 30 , 1991 . And there is the Senate that was voted_in last year in an election called by the military ' s appointed puppet government , then headed by Prime_Minister Marc Bazin . The 1993 election was never recognized by the international community or accepted by Aristide or his followers . But an additional complication is that Aristide , who never formed a real political_party , did not command a majority in either house of Haiti ' s Parliament . Many of the parliamentarians who backed him when he was elected had already dropped their support before he was sent into exile . So it is not certain that there are enough votes to pass a bill that could hasten the restoration of Aristide ' s government , even with the return of those legislators who had fled in fear in recent months . With so many legislators having fled or gone_into hiding , the Parliament has not been able to form a quorum for most of the last two years and there has been no official meeting of the entire legislature this year . A Haitian source close to Col . Francois said there will be little resistance to the American military presence , &quot; but that does not mean there will be cooperation with either the Americans or Aristide. &quot; &quot; We will drive them crazy by doing what we always do -- delay , refuse to cooperate and even lie . Aristide is still supported by the people , but not by the elite or the military and not by the government work_force . &quot; What are you ( Americans ) going_to do ? Make government workers go_to work ? And what if Aristide tries to fire a bunch of them ? &quot; This source laughed when told that U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher called the Haitian judicial_system &quot; a sound legal structure &quot; that could deal with people suspected of crimes and human_rights violations not covered by an amnesty . &quot; Even in good times , it didn ' t work , &quot; the source said . &quot; The idea that it will be able to deal with disputes , particularly if Aristide does try to prosecute anyone , is both funny and horrifying. &quot; The announcement of the agreement to remove the military_leaders left unspecified the fate of Haiti ' s 7 # 000-man army . U.S. policy regarding the army has varied over the last three years ; at times , officials have said that it would have to be completely dismantled , but at others , they have called_for it to be left intact but retrained .</TEXT>
