   <HEADLINE> TUNEUP FOR A VENERABLE VEHICLE ; AT 20 , ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT MAY GET SOME IMPROVEMENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The federal Endangered Species Act celebrated its 20th birthday last week . Rather than being a cause for celebration , the milestone has escalated an already angry argument that is drowning_out constructive discussion of how best to reconcile species preservation with human development . That both activities are vital should be beyond question . But one measure of the distortion that has occurred in the argument over congressional review and reauthorization of this act is a growing belief by some that one activity need be sacrificed to the other . Congress passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973 , declaring that diversity of animal and plant species has &quot; aesthetic , ecological , educational , historical , recreational , and scientific value to the nation and its people. &quot; That value is even more salient today , as , for instance , the over-harvesting of some wild species like Pacific Northwest salmon threatens their viability and scientists are finding medicinal worth in a growing number of natural compounds . GOOD AIM , CLUNKY MEANS : The act affirms these values by providing a mechanism to protect and encourage recovery of threatened and endangered species while also allowing_for development . Landowners whose property contains animals , plants or insects that have been found endangered cannot harm those species and , in most cases , must create a habitat recovery plan to facilitate species regeneration . About 750 species are now on the federal endangered species list , with as_many as 3 # 000 more feared to be in poor ecological health . While there may be broad consensus about the need to foster biodiversity , the act ' s record of often cumbersome implementation , the growing number of species believed to be at risk and the absence of other strong protections for natural habitats have sparked a growing effort to weaken the goals of the act itself rather than to streamline its implementation . Yet the 20-year history of species protection indicates those goals remain appropriate and that , though it has weaknesses , overall the act works . Landowners with imperiled species on their property have been able to proceed with development while limiting and mitigating the ecological damage caused by construction . Most federal works projects affecting endangered species also have been completed ; of more_than than 34 # 000 evaluated from 1987 to 1991 , federal_officials had to halt only 23 because they jeopardized species . And the act does have its major successes : The bald_eagle , the peregrine_falcon , the Pacific gray_whale , the brown pelican , the whooping_crane and other species once on the brink of extinction have recovered dramatically due_to federal protection . DON ' T LOSE IT , IMPROVE IT : Yet there clearly is room for improvement . The first need is to better document the extent and the health of the animal and plant_life within our borders . That vast survey effort is already under way , begun last year by Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt . Results from this national biodiversity survey should lower the volume some in debates over which species are close to extinction and to what degree . The second task is to improve the application of the act . Legislation introduced by Sens . Max Baucus ( D-Mont. ) and John H . Chafee ( R-R.I. ) would do that . Their bill would set deadlines for completion of recovery plans and increase funding to allow the federal agencies charged with enforcement of the act to be more responsive . The measure would also encourage strategies to preserve entire habitats rather than individual species , thus avoiding potential conflicts between plans for different species in the same area . California has taken the lead in this approach . The bill deserves support because Baucus and Chafee recognize that the act they would amend is still needed .</TEXT>
