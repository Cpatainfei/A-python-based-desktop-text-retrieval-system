   <TEXT> Kelly Walton spent a dozen days driving the length and breadth of Idaho , stopping in every tiny town . Missourian Paul Summers is meeting with church groups . Doug Burman ' s helpers in Washington state are talking with their friends at_work . They and the like-minded in four other states are_on a quest . Signatures are their trophy -- enough to earn a place on their November state ballots for a set of referendums that , if enacted , could hobble the gay-rights movement . From the Pacific Coast to the Midwest , conservative activists like Walton , Summers and Burman are circulating petitions for ballot initiatives that would bar the adoption of any laws protecting gay_men and lesbians from discrimination . Several of the proposed measures also would forbid government recognition of gay domestic partnerships , the spending of public funds in a way that implies acceptance of homosexuality , or its sympathetic treatment in public_schools . With a month to go before most of the petitions are_due , it remains unclear how many of the ballot drives_in the seven states -- Washington , Oregon , Nevada , Arizona , Idaho , Missouri and Michigan -- will be successful . But they are already occupying center stage in the gay movement , where they are seen as an ominous trend that will be difficult to defeat . &quot; This is an unofficial national referendum on homosexuality in America , &quot; said Robert Bray of the National Gay and Lesbian Task_Force , one of several gay groups organizing against the initiatives . &quot; And it ' s not a coincidence these are popping_up all over. &quot; Initiative proponents are moving ahead despite the legal clouds that hang over such measures . An anti-gay-rights referendum approved by Colorado voters in 1992 is bottled_up by court challenges . A number of local referendums adopted by Oregon towns have been rendered toothless by a state law , which is in turn the subject of a lawsuit , while in other states courts have blocked local anti-gay-rights ordinances . Such challenges notwithstanding , conservative activists say it is important to keep the_matter before the public . &quot; We want to get the debate out of the Establishment and ( to ) the citizens , &quot; said Lon Mabon of the Oregon Citizens Alliance , the organization behind a bitterly contested referendum that was defeated by voters in 1992 . The group has since promoted the local initiatives passed in some two_dozen Oregon communities . &quot; The more elections we can have , the more votes , the more it ' s going_to tell the judges and the politicians and even the editorial boards ( that ) this is the standard we want to have , &quot; added Mabon , who is trying to get another anti-gay initiative on the Oregon ballot this fall and is also involved in ballot efforts in Washington state , Idaho and Nevada . Gay-rights foes describe the initiatives as a response to an aggressive gay movement that they say is demanding endorsement of immoral behavior . &quot; They insist that society -- with government reinforcement -- recognize their lifestyle , &quot; said Summers , who is leading the Missouri petition drive . The signature-gathering efforts generally have been low key -- partly , backers say , because they don ' t have much money , don ' t want to be harassed and want to keep their opponents guessing . Organizers in Washington state -- where there are two competing anti-gay measures -- Idaho and Oregon seem confident of collecting enough signatures , but in other states the outcome is less certain . The Arizona initiative hasn ' t even mustered solid support in the conservative community . &quot; It ' s not a mainstream conservative effort , &quot; said Cathi Herrod of the Arizona branch of Concerned Women for America , which is not involved with the referendum drive . &quot; It ' s a question of timing and strategy . We just don ' t believe it ' s the right strategy for Arizona in ' 94 . . . . We would rather focus time and energy on ( political ) races. &quot; In the meantime , gay-rights attorneys are trying to derail the initiatives before they make_it to the ballots . The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund , a national group , has joined legal teams challenging the ballot proposals on both technical and constitutional grounds . &quot; Measures which put the fundamental rights of individual citizens to a vote are an inappropriate subject for the ballot , &quot; said Lambda staff attorney Suzanne B . Goldberg . The legal attacks have so far yielded mixed results . In March , the Florida Supreme Court killed a proposed initiative , snuffing_out what would have been one of the most volatile anti-gay referendum fights in the nation . The court ruled that the measure violated the state constitution by addressing more_than one subject . Legal challenges in Idaho and Washington state have failed , while a lower court ' s ruling against Mabon ' s proposed Oregon initiative is_on appeal . Both sides are drawing from the 1992 referendum battles in Colorado and Oregon , refining their messages accordingly as they pursue middle-of-the-road voters . Polling , focus groups and political consultants are helping shape themes . Gay-rights advocates have learned that one of their most powerful arguments is that the ballot measures promote discrimination . &quot; Seventy-six percent of the American public thinks it ' s wrong to discriminate ( against gays ) in hiring and firing , &quot; said Anne F . Lewis , a political consultant working with the Human_Rights Campaign Fund , a national gay group . &quot; You ' re never going_to get better than 76 % . &quot; Gay-rights advocates are also portraying the referendums as part of a much larger conservative effort . &quot; I think these initiatives are wedges by which the far right can divide communities and advance a broader agenda , &quot; said Bray , who has traveled more_than 100 # 000 miles crisscrossing the country to find and train budding gay organizers in such unlikely spots as Wyoming and the outback of Arizona . Indeed , Bray and others insist that the initiatives have spurred so_much organizing in unexpected places that the movement will come_out ahead , regardless of what happens in November . Activists are further turning_to the Democrats for help . The Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund last winter released a letter in which President Clinton expressed disapproval of the anti-gay initiatives . And representatives of the Democratic National Committee have attended coalition meetings about the referendums . &quot; We ' re tracking these developments largely as they impact turnout in those states , &quot; said DNC spokesman Jim Whitney . &quot; Clearly anti-gay initiatives are one vehicle the radical right uses to . . . get their voters out. &quot; Gay-rights opponents are sharing ideas as well . Last month , the group that spearheaded the 1992 Colorado referendum hosted a closed meeting in Colorado Springs in which anti-gay activists from a number of states mulled_over strategy . Not that they are in universal agreement . In Washington state , for instance , there is some resentment of Mabon ' s arrival . &quot; We don ' t believe Lon Mabon ' s presence -- nothing personally against him -- would help our effort , and we have a different approach , &quot; said Burman , who is backing a rival anti-gay measure . And although the Rev . Louis P . Sheldon of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition is helping with several of the initiative drives , his group decided not to proceed with a ballot effort it was considering for California . Pointing to the repeal of local gay-rights ordinances in various states , Sheldon said : &quot; It ' s been shown to us by these elections it ' s more prudent for them to make a move and then repeal , than for us to initiate a ballot measure against them. &quot; The Tug-of-War Over Gay Rights Anti-gay ordianances aim to repeal existing laws or block new laws that would protect gay people from discrimination . Federal civil_rights applies o race , creed , color and religion -- not sexuality or gender . States in which efforts are under way to put anti-gay initiatives on ballots Arizona Missouri Oregon Washington Nevada Idaho Michigan * States with legislation protecting gay rights Massachusetts Connecticut New Jersey California Hawaii Minnesota Wisconsin Vermont District_of_Columbia FROM PROPOSALS TO LIMIT GAY RIGHTS OREGON : &quot; Children , students and employees shall not be advised , instructed or taught by any government_agency , department or political_unit . . . that homosexuality is the legal or social equivalent of race , color , religion , gender , age or national origin. &quot; IDAHO : &quot; Same-sex marriages and domestic partnerships are hereby declared to be against public policy and shall not be legally recognized in any manner by any agency . . .
