   <HEADLINE> CRUISE VIEWS : VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE EARTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We drove down to San Diego the last_day of September to see Seven Seas Cruise Line ' s Hanseatic , a 170-passenger luxury expedition vessel wending its way gradually south to Antarctica after a swift and successful transit of the Northwest Passage . The first of a series of five Antarctic cruises begins from Buenos Aires Dec . 18 . Originally built_in 1991 for Seattle-based Society Expeditions as the Society Adventurer , the ship was never delivered to Society because of a contractual dispute , and languished for almost two years in a Finnish shipyard before being taken_over by a German tour company , Hanseatic Tours . San Francisco-based Seven Seas , which operates the very popular little Song of Flower , began U.S. sales and marketing for the Hanseatic earlier this year . Inside , the Hanseatic is an elegant and luxurious ship , with rich wood-toned paneling in cabins and public rooms and spacious staterooms , all with windows or portholes . Each accommodation , even the least expensive , has a marble bathroom with tub and shower , a separate sitting area with chaise or sofa , TV_set with VCR , mini-refrigerator stocked with nonalcoholic beverages , and generous closet and drawer space . All 90 staterooms measure 236 square_feet ; four two-room suites measure 475 . The lunch we had aboard , while not on the cutting edge of cuisine , was tasty and well prepared . A trio plays for dancing in the big , handsome Explorer Lounge in the evenings , and a pianist plays_at teatime . The ship has a beauty_shop , a well-equipped spa and hospital . The Dec . 18 Christmas cruise from Buenos Aires spends 18 nights visiting the Falklands , South Georgia , South Orkneys and the Antarctic Peninsula , ending in Ushuaia , Argentina . Three 11-night round-trip sailings from Ushuaia depart Jan . 16 and 27 and Feb . 7 , cruising the Falklands , Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetlands . And a 20-night sailing from Ushuaia to Cape_Town , South_Africa , leaving Feb . 18 , will visit the Peninsula , South Shetland Islands , South Georgia and Tristan da Cunha . All are scheduled to land at Cape Horn if weather permits . Fares range from $ 6 # 750 to $ 15 # 995 per person , double occupancy , including air fare .
