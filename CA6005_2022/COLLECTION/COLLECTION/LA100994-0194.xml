   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / MORIAH FILMS : FOR WIESENTHAL CENTER , A LIBERATING EXPERIENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rabbi Marvin Hier , dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles , decided late last year that it was time for the institution to venture into filmmaking , to make its own documentaries on what has always been its foremost interest : Keeping alive the memory of the Holocaust . Thus , Moriah Films , the center ' s official film division , was born . With its name inspired by Mt . Moriah where , Judaic teachings say , Jerusalem was founded , the division saw its first documentary , &quot; Liberation , &quot; screened last month at the Deauville Film Festival in France , where it was the only documentary shown in a special edition of the festival devoted to commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-day . The film chronicles life on the Allied homefronts as Adolf Hitler ' s military machine acted to decimate Europe ' s Jewish population . &quot; We didn ' t see this as another Holocaust film -- this is much more , &quot; Hier says . &quot; But on the other hand , to ignore the Holocaust by telling only the military aspect would be a grave disservice . So we balanced the two. &quot; &quot; Liberation &quot; will have its Los Angeles premiere on Oct . 18 , and then will be released throughout the world early next year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of VE Day in May , 1995 . The film begins with British Prime_Minister Neville Chamberlain ' s radio_broadcast announcing on Sept . 3 , 1939 , that &quot; this country is at war with Germany. &quot; What follows is a collection of images -- still photographs and archival and newsreel footage -- supplemented by original radio_news broadcasts and first-person accounts culled from letters and journals written during wartime . &quot; Liberation &quot; often tells its story by documenting ironies that are difficult to accept . One segment focuses_on the response of Europe ' s Catholics to the war . Pope Pius XII , for instance , is shown praying for the swift victory of Hitler and his invading armies , despite the eyewitness accounts detailing how many German Catholics were themselves interred in concentration_camps , or even executed , for offering help to Jews . And even Jews themselves differed in their response to the war and to Hitler . In a chilling sequence , newsreel footage shows a group of rabbis , all recent European immigrants , marching through Washington hoping to implore President Roosevelt to meet with them and draw his attention to the massacre of European Jews . But at the last-minute urging of American Jews , fearful of an embarrassing confrontation , Roosevelt refuses . Hier co-wrote the screenplay with Martin Gilbert , a fellow at Oxford_University . Hier and &quot; Liberation &quot; producer-director Arnold Schwartzman , an Oscar-winning team in 1981 for their documentary &quot; Genocide , &quot; also collaborated in 1990 on &quot; Echoes That Remain , &quot; a film documenting pre-World War II European Jewish life . With such a strong body_of_work behind them , financing the $ 650 # 000 film came relatively easily , mostly from &quot; friends of the Wiesenthal Center who liked the idea of its being involved in producing documentaries , &quot; says Hier , 55 . &quot; Liberation &quot; has the look of an expensive film , thanks to the liberal use of footage from film archives around the world . Actors who participated in the project as narrators , including Whoopi Goldberg , Ben Kingsley and Patrick Stewart , donated their efforts . Many of the songs Schwartzman , 58 , chose for the film were his own favorites from that time , which he often contrasts with a tinge of irony to groups of images for a glaring effect . Footage of Hitler standing in front of the Eiffel Tower during the_French Occupation , for instance , is set to &quot; The Last Time I Saw Paris. &quot; Although Hier says with a laugh that there are &quot; no plans to challenge the big-time studios in town , &quot; in testimony to the center ' s commitment to Moriah Films , they ' ll get their own offices , where they hope to regularly produce documentaries . As for future films , Hier sees resistance activity during World_War_II as a possible subject . &quot; Each country had their own resistance movement , he says , &quot; yet we don ' t know who they were . If someone asked me to name 15 major resisters , I couldn ' t even name them ! &quot;</TEXT>
