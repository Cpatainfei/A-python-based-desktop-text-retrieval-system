   <HEADLINE> COMPAQ TO UNVEIL AMD CHIP COMPUTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Compaq Computer Corp . today is expected to unveil new models in its year-old Presario consumer line and base them on chips made by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. rather than market leader Intel Corp . This is the first time a major manufacturer has used a chip maker besides Intel for an entire product line.While planned for some time , it is being announced just after Compaq Chief_Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer publicly criticized Intel at an industry conference in Spain . By relying_on AMD 486 microprocessors rather than the newer and more expensive Intel Pentium chip , Compaq is betting consumers are more interested in saving money than having leading-edge technology in their machines . It will spend tens of millions of dollars on TV ads this fall , competing with Intel ' s ads for Pentium . &quot; The big issue is practical functionality , &quot; said Mark Vena , brand manager for Presario products , saying most consumers don ' t require Pentium power , now chiefly used for graphics and video . Compaq announced in February it had signed AMD as a second supplier of microprocessors , the &quot; brain &quot; of a personal_computer . The company said it needed another large supplier because of its growth . Analysts had expected Compaq would use AMD chips_in the consumer PCs . AST Research is expected to soon bring_out consumer models based on chips by Cyrix , another Intel clone company . Compaq plans to promote the new Presario models as &quot; home information centers &quot; since each model has a built-in speaker phone and individual voice mailboxes . For $ 200 more , they can be equipped with a TV tuner . Each model also has a CD-ROM_drive , stereo speakers and a modem .</TEXT>
