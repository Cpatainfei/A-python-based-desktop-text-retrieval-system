   <HEADLINE> SILK ; SAVOR YOUR $ 9.95 T-SHIRTS WHILE YOU CAN . THIS RICH FABRIC MAY ONCE AGAIN BECOME THE CLOTH OF KINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is as precious as gold , as strong as steel , as light as gossamer . And , as the label says , it must be dry-cleaned . Now there ' s a myth . Silk has been around for 4 # 600 years , dry_cleaning only since the 1920s . But it is exceptionally light , exceptionally strong , and it may be_on the verge of once again becoming the cloth of kings . For a decade , silk and silk garments have been flooding_in from a newly industrial China , driving down prices to the humble realms of cotton and polyester . But that could change starting today when new U.S. restrictions on imports of silk apparel from China kick_in . The days of the $ 9.95 silk T-shirt may be numbered . Silk ' s image has always been at_odds with the casual , inexpensive merchandise worn by the masses in recent years to the grocery_store or the movies . &quot; My grandfather , whose family made silk in Italy in the 1700s , associated silk with the age of Persian princesses , &quot; says John Sullivan , head of American Silk Mills in Plains , Pa . &quot; It ' s regal and lush and special. &quot; Most consumers would agree . &quot; In the customer ' s mind , silk has always been a prestige fabric , &quot; says Patty Sapp , a buyer for the Broadway stores , where silk blouses have sold for as little as two for $ 30 . Such low prices have raised the question , &quot; Can this be real silk ? &quot; Well , yes . But in many cases , it ' s not the fabric it once was . In 2640 BC , the legend goes , the young Chinese empress Hsi Ling Shi discovered a blight on the royal mulberry_trees . Gorging on their leaves were white worms that later entombed themselves in cocoons . When one of the cocoons dropped into her tea , the empress watched , fascinated , as a delicate , shining filament unwound in the hot liquid . In no time , she and her minions developed a process of reeling the cocoon filament into threads , weaving the threads into fabric and sewing the fabric into finery . Then , voila , they turned the whole business into a closely guarded industry . At its core is the silk moth , Bombyx_mori , which flies a little , mates a lot , and produces hundreds of eggs in its short moth life . The eggs produce caterpillars that eat their weight daily in mulberry leaves , growing about 70 times their original size . They then weave cocoons , extruding liquid silk and a gummy sealant called sericin at the rate of a foot a minute , and go_to_sleep -- or whatever you call the suspended animation of a chrysalis , or pupa . If left alone , the moth would break_through the cocoon and repeat the whole cycle . But nature ' s way would snap the single continuous thread -- sometimes a mile long -- and trip_up production . So the chrysalis is killed by heat or steam , the cocoon is soaked in hot water to soften the sericin , and the silk thread is unwound and reeled_off , together with the threads from several other cocoons . Today ' s process differs only in the quantities produced and in high-tech improvements made in the worms ' environment , incubation and feeding . Secrecy still shrouds rituals and &quot; proprietary information known only to the Chinese and secret since the days of Marco Polo , &quot; says Cass Johnson , assistant director of international trade for the American Textile Manufacturers Institute in Washington . For 3 # 000 years , the Chinese trekked their silk cloth west over the deserts and mountains of the old Silk_Road toward the gateways of the Mediterranean civilizations . Outsiders had no clues about its origin ; some thought silk floss grew on trees . And its cost was great , controlled by Persian traders at the other end of the road . But in AD 550 , two spies sent by the Byzantine emperor brought_back cocoons , and the secret was out . Tracing silk production from that point is like taking a subway ride through the ancient world . By the 1980s , the business of weaving silk into cloth was dying_out in many places , &quot; killed_off by the Japanese , who did_it cheaper , &quot; says Hans Baumann , executive_vice_president of the Rudolph-Desco Co. , a New Jersey-based importer of silk yarns . But not for long . China , dormant during the decade-long Cultural Revolution , was &quot; opened &quot; by President Richard M . Nixon in the early 1970s and granted &quot; most favored nation &quot; status for trade by President Jimmy_Carter in 1980 , giving it widespread access to U.S. markets . With production facilities and a labor_force in place , it was soon supplying much of the world ' s silk . Chinese silk has been imported to the United States without quotas and with low or no duties because the silk industry here -- unlike cotton or polyester -- is very small . &quot; The purpose of duties , &quot; says U.S. Customs spokesman Greg Doss , &quot; is to make money and protect what we make here . If we don ' t make_it , it comes free. &quot; The duty on finished apparel has been negligible , particularly contrasted with other fabrics -- 6 % on silk sweaters and shirts , for example , 17 % for wool , 21 % for cotton , 34 % for synthetics . Buoyed by investments and advice from business interests in Hong Kong and Taiwan , China last year sent us more_than $ 1.8 billion in silk garments , or about 75 % of the $ 2.4 billion worth we imported , reports the American Textile Manufacturers Institute . &quot; China is now the largest overall supplier of apparel of all kinds , &quot; says Jim Langlois , director of the Seattle-based National Apparel and Textile Assn. , representing importers and wholesalers . Today ' s Chinese silk may be plentiful , but much of it is not of the quality you ' d offer Persian princesses . These are fast-production goods with a mass-market goal -- heavy on plain , collarless , pocketless designs -- the realm of the silk T . Many of the items are labeled &quot; washable , &quot; a confusing designation in that silk has always been washable if &quot; you don ' t get aggressive with it , &quot; says Sullivan , who is also president if the International Silk Assn. ' s U.S. chapter ( See tips on care , this page. ) What ' s new about washable silk is that it ' s pre-washed and has presumably shrunk as much as it ' s going_to -- up_to 50 % . It has already been dealt with aggressively , so it will probably take more of the same , including machine washing . The very low-priced silk is almost always washable , says Roger Shatafian , president of Creative Natural Fabrics in Los Angeles , noting that &quot; at those prices , it doesn ' t pay to send it out for dry cleaning. &quot; Nevertheless , silk garments often bear &quot; Dry-Clean Only &quot; tags . In some cases , special handling is required , more likely because of the dyes involved than the fabric . In others , the company advises &quot; Dry-Clean Only &quot; to avoid returns , Baumann says . If something goes_wrong , it ' s the dry_cleaner ' s problem . Popularly priced silk has been a boon for retailers over the last few years . Now , something &quot; always hard to get and very pricey has become available , &quot; says Sapp , of the Broadway . Chinese silk &quot; went_into blouses , jog suits , two-piece dresses , pants and tunics , &quot; she says , &quot; and the growth of the silk business in ( moderately priced ) clothing has been exponential . It used to be all polyester. &quot; The market for &quot; all silk &quot; businesses has also expanded . WinterSilks , a Wisconsin-based mail-order catalogue , was founded 14 years ago on knitted silk underwear , an upscale cold-weather accouterment appealing_to skiers , outdoor types and the &quot; dominant user &quot; -- urban career women . &quot; It ' s lightweight , and insulates well and wicks moisture away from the skin , &quot; explains John Jeffery , company president . With up_to 15 Chinese factories under contract to supply garments , WinterSilks -- now a $ 30-million business -- has added another catalogue , Silk Collection , of dressier garments . But Chinese dominance has also meant hard_times for would-be competitors in the United States , which is lacking in silkworms and low-cost labor . The last of U.S. companies that made thread from silk fiber closed six years ago , and makers of silk fabric have bailed_out of the apparel market . &quot; Our mill door cost ( labor and materials alone ) now is higher than the selling_price of Chinese fabric , &quot; says Sullivan of American Silk Mills . His company -- one of only a dozen U.S. silk manufacturers left -- instead weaves its silk for home furnishings , such_as upholstery and draperies . &quot; Sadly , &quot; he said , &quot; the Chinese goods are as low-grade as possible . I feel_for them -- they need to employ people there -- but it has caused the loss of a high art form. &quot; Other arms of the industry have their own troubles . Shatafian , who imports better-quality silk fabrics from South_Korea and China , sells mostly to high-end clothing manufacturers . &quot; On the low end , our manufacturers can ' t compete with the low-quality finished garments coming_in , &quot; he says . &quot; In the last two or three years , China is actually selling garments cheaper than we can sell fabric. &quot; The quotas on imported Chinese silk , announced by Clinton_Administration trade officials in January , will apply to finished clothing , not to silk fiber , thread or fabric . But U.S. makers and importers of silk say they didn ' t seek the change and were not the primary concern . Trade officials confirm that the quotas are designed to protect low-priced , non-silk apparel made here . In other words , Jeffery says , &quot; ( U.S. Trade Representative ) Mickey Kantor was protecting cotton. &quot; Or , others say , polyester . The reaction is mixed . Speaking_for manufacturers , Sullivan says it may &quot; encourage more people to manufacture their garments here , if we could compete on price points . Maybe it will encourage Seventh Avenue to look_to do more with American mills. &quot; Speaking_for importers , Langlois of the textile association says : &quot; We aren ' t pleased because we don ' t like to see any limits on the trade. &quot; No one is sure how much or how soon the quotas might affect prices here . But if ever there was a time to hoard silk Ts , it ' s now . Silk / The Delicate Cycle A silk garment is the culmination of a long process that begins with a brightly colored caterpillar . Raised on farms throughout the world , the Bombyx_mori , or silkworm , spins a cocoon that yields a strong , elastic , lightweight fiber . The thread is then dyed and woven into the cloth people love for its soft , luxurious feel . 1 . A female silkworm_moth lays 300 or more eggs in early summer , depositing them on strips of special paper , then dies . The eggs are placed in cold storage until the following spring , then moved to an incubator . After about 20 days , the eggs hatch . 2 . The tiny worms , kept_on trays , eat fresh mulberry leaves almost continually around the clock . After four to five weeks , they have grown about 70 times their original size and shed their skins four times . About 3 inches long and 1 inch thick when full grown , a worm has 12 body sections and three pairs of legs . 3 . Now ready to make their cocoons , the worms creep into compartments containing twigs or straw . They attach themselves to the sticks , then -- swinging their heads from side to side to release the fluid that hardens into silk thread -- form cocoons . After about three days , the cocoon is completed and the worm changes into a pupa . Farmers allow a small percentage of pupae to develop_into moths . The rest are killed . 4 . The cocoons are shipped to a factory to unwind . They are placed in a basin of hot water to dissolve a gummy natural substance , sericin , that holds their threads together . The filaments are then drawn_together and pulled_through a tiny guide . The melted sericin binds several filaments into a single thread , which is wound on to a reel . The silk is later rewound into skeins . 5 . Because the raw silk is still too weak for weaving , it must be strengthened through &quot; throwing , &quot; or the twisting of strands to produce specific weights of thread for weaving . After throwing , the silk is boiled in hot soap to remove the sericin . 6 . Dyes are applied to silk either before ( skein dyeing ) or after ( piece dyeing ) weaving . 7 . Silk yarns are woven into cloth on automatic power_looms , which can produce designs and patterns . * What It Costs As import rules have relaxed , so has the price of silk . A sampling of blouses found around town : * How to Keep It Clean Although some manufacturers recommend dry-cleaning , silk can be hand-washed . Observe these guidelines for best results : * Wash separately in lukewarm water with a gentle detergent . * Rinse in lukewarm or cold water . * Remove excess water by rolling garment in a towel . * Hang_in a cool , dark place to dry . * Iron at low_temperature on the reverse side while still damp . * Other Tips * Always apply perfume or deodorant before donning a silk garment * Never expose silk to strong , direct light for a long_time period . * Never soak silk in water for a long_time period .</TEXT>
