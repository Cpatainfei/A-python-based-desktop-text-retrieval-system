   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FINALS ; YESTER-YEARNING ; TO SPOILED FANS OF THE BEAUTIFUL GAME , BRAZIL OF TODAY IS SIMPLY WINNING UGLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It would be going too far to suggest that U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic was satisfied after his team ' s 1-0 loss in the second round of the 1994 World Cup . But neither was he dissatisfied . Considering the opponent that July 4 afternoon at Stanford Stadium , who could have asked_for more ? &quot; Brazil , &quot; he said , &quot; is Brazil. &quot; As he made that remark , intended as the supreme compliment to one of the world ' s preeminent soccer powers , one could feel the breeze as far away as Palo Alto as 150 million Brazilians shook their heads in dissent . This Brazil team might be the best in the world today . This Brazil team might win the World Cup with a victory over Italy on Sunday in the championship game at the Rose Bowl . But this Brazil team , critics from Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro declare , is not Brazil . Translation : This is not the Brazil of Pele , not the Brazil that retired the Jules Rimet Trophy with three World Cup titles between 1958-70 and not the Brazil of jogo bonito , the beautiful game . This team , the critics claim , is masquerading as Brazil , and for that Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has been apportioned most of the blame . On Wednesday at the Rose Bowl , where Brazil beat Sweden , 1-0 , to advance to the final for the first time in 24 years , he was the object of derisive whistles and boos during pregame introductions and again whenever his picture was displayed on the stadium ' s big screen . Parreira ' s most ardent defender has been Mario Zagalo , the 62-year-old assistant who had to be physically restrained from attacking fans who jeered the coach at the airport upon the team ' s return home from a loss at Bolivia last year . More_than anyone else , Zagalo can empathize with Parreira . During an interview at the team ' s Fullerton headquarters Tuesday , Zagalo recalled the second-guessing he withstood as head coach of the 1970 team , considered by many to be the best to play in the World Cup . &quot; The pressure hasn ' t changed , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s just that there are more people now . We had 90 million people in Brazil in 1970 . Today , we have 150 million . In other words , there were 90 million Brazilian coaches then , 150 million today. &quot; Parreira , 51 , has complained that his critics are living_in the past , failing to accept the realities of today ' s soccer . One is that Pele is retired , never to return . Another is that more countries play the sport well than in 1970 , when Brazil outscored its opponents , 19-7 , and was held to fewer than three goals only once in six games . It won the championship game over Italy , 4-1 . &quot; The distance between us and the other teams is much smaller , &quot; he said this week . &quot; There is no gulf anymore. &quot; And another reality is that the game , for better or worse , has evolved defensively , rendering the uninhibited , free-flowing offensive advances virtually obsolete . Teams in this World Cup have seemed particularly intent_on preventing Brazil from displaying its panache , retreating so vigorously that they all but forfeit any chances of_their_own to score . In six games , only 42 shots have been fired at the Brazilians . &quot; We have a saying in Brazil that if only one person comes_to fight , you can ' t have a fight , &quot; Parreira said after a first-round 1-1 tie with Sweden in which the opponents tried only four shots . They were not even that bold in the semifinal rematch , attempting only three . The Brazilians tried_for two decades to resist the tide , leaving themselves vulnerable to counterattacks in one World Cup disappointment after another . Then they overcompensated in 1990 with Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni ' s defensive posture , which included the use of a European-style sweeper . &quot; No more jogo bonito , &quot; midfielder Dunga proclaimed . &quot; This is the Brazil of sweat and sacrifice. &quot; It also was the Brazil that scored only four goals in four games and was eliminated in the second round by Argentina . When Parreira became the coach , he promised that Brazil would be a team of sweat and sacrifice and jogo bonito . Whether Brazil wins or loses Sunday , many experts -- outside Brazil -- will agree that Parreira has done everything he can to achieve that blend with the talent he has . He has fielded a team on which marvelous strikers such_as Romario and Bebeto can coexist with gritty midfielders such_as Dunga , Zinho and Mauro Silva ; and on which central defenders Aldair and Marcio Santos hold their ground so steadfastly that the left and right backs , Branco and Jorginho , can make frequent forays_into the offensive end . &quot; The past five World Cups we have been favorites , and where have we finished ? &quot; Parreira asked before the tournament . Not waiting for a reply , he said : &quot; Nowhere . Balance will win this World Cup. &quot; That balance has produced 11 goals and given_up only three . Despite Parreira ' s efforts , this team is not likely to be remembered as one of the best -- or even one of Brazil ' s best -- because of its uncharacteristic inability to maneuver the ball through the midfield . Although the team ' s playmaking No . 10 , Rai , was considered as recently as two years ago as one of the world ' s best , he slumped in recent months to the extent that polls in Brazil revealed that fans there did not even want him selected to the team . &quot; It ' s true , we lack creativity , &quot; Parreira said in May . &quot; I look , but I don ' t find it . The fact is , Brazil today doesn ' t have a great No . 10 jersey any more , like a Rivelino , an Ademir da Guia or a Zico . Zico was the last . Give me one , and I ' ll put him on the team right now. &quot; When no one stepped_forward , Parreira started Rai in the first three games but benched him in favor of Mazinho before the second round . Mazinho has not been entirely satisfactory , and Romario , who prefers to plant himself in the penalty area and wait for the ball , has had to make expeditions into the midfield to search for it . Romario and Bebeto have combined for eight goals , but , with their scoring touch , they might have recorded spectacular numbers if they had someone to get them the ball . So perhaps historians will not fawn over these Brazilians . But if they win the World Cup , perhaps their fans at_home finally will .</TEXT>
