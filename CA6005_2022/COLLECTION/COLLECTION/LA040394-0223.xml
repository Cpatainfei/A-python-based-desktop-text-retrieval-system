   <HEADLINE> CHAMPIONING CASE AGAINST TOBACCO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Public interest in the issue of tobacco smoking was best summed_up by a student who recently said , &quot; I would think the people who don ' t smoke probably don ' t care , and people who do smoke don ' t want to be told to quit. &quot; MADD ( Mothers Against Drunk Driving ) were so outraged that they acted together to significantly reduce the number of deaths on the highways.Yet who is mad enough to stop the No . 1 preventable cause of death today ? Tobacco kills more people than all deaths due_to drunk drivers , violent crimes , AIDS and illegal drugs combined ! Close to half a_million people die horrible deaths each year due_to tobacco-related disease . It would also appear that these &quot; children of all ages &quot; must die alone and without a friend or loved one to mourn their unnecessary death . Half a_million people die and no one to wear a ribbon of any color . More_than passive smoke , passive people will be the death of us all .
