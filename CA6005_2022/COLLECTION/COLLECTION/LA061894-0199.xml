   <HEADLINE> QUAKER OATS STOCK BOILS_OVER ON TAKEOVER TALK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Quaker Oats Co. , maker of popular products ranging from oatmeal to Gatorade , was rumored Friday to be a takeover_target of Nestle , and the talk sent its stock to a 12-month high . Shares_in the Chicago-based company closed $ 7.25 higher at $ 78.625 on the New York Stock_Exchange . A Quaker Oats spokesman could not be reached for comment . Quaker Oats declined to comment on its stock activity , according to a statement from the NYSE . &quot; The company stated that its policy is not to comment on unusual market activity or rumors , &quot; the exchange said . Officials of Swiss food giant Nestle also could not be reached for comment . Journalist Dan Dorfman reported the rumors on CNBC-TV . &quot; Quaker is often mentioned as a possible takeover_target , &quot; said analyst Ellen Baras of credit agency Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. &quot; The whole company is very well put_together , so who knows , &quot; said Jack Maxwell , analyst with Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer . What is not clear , however , is whether Nestle would be the likely buyer , said Joanna Scharf of S.G. Warburg Securities . &quot; It seems unlikely that Nestle would wish to invest in a U.S. cereal company , given its international cereal partnership with General Mills Inc. , &quot; Scharf said . The partnership , Cereal Partners Worldwide , is marketing cereals in Europe and has begun to enter new markets , such_as Mexico . But Nestle is said to be cash-rich and seeking an acquisition after Gerber , the largest U.S. baby food maker , accepted a $ 3.7-billion bid from Sandoz , the_Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group , earlier this month . That deal has spurred merger talk and subsequent stock run-ups within the food industry . An alliance with a large conglomerate such_as Nestle could help Quaker Oats expand marketing of its Gatorade sports beverage , analysts said . &quot; Gatorade has had trouble getting distribution they need in some markets , &quot; Baras said . The sports drink had sales of $ 750 million in the United States and Canada last year . Quaker , which makes Cap ' n Crunch cereal , is a small player in the $ 8-billion-a-year ready-to-eat cereal market , lagging leader Kellogg Co . and second-place General Mills . However , Quaker dominates the hot-cereal market with its Quaker Oats oatmeal . Its other well-known products include Rice A Roni and Aunt Jemima pancake mix .</TEXT>
