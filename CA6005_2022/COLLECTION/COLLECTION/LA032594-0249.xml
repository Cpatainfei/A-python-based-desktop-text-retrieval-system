   <HEADLINE> WILDLIFE SERVICE URGED TO PROTECT PACIFIC POCKET_MOUSE ; ENVIRONMENT : SPEAKERS AT HEARING ASK THAT THE ANIMAL BE PLACED ON PERMANENT ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST . SUCH STATUS WOULD AFFECT PLANNED DANA POINT HEADLANDS RESORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A handful of people braved a driving rain Thursday night to urge government protection for the Pacific pocket_mouse , a 4-inch-long rodent that could delay the construction of a proposed $ 500-million resort on the Dana Point Headlands . * &quot; I ' m here to try to save a little bit of the Headlands that my family grew_up with , &quot; said Bob Larwood , a 26-year Dana Point resident . &quot; The Headlands is a wondrous place. &quot; Said Tony Gallagher , a member of a group called Save the Headlands : &quot; This is the only part of Dana Point that is still natural. &quot; The comments were made at a public hearing on a proposal by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to place the mouse on the permanent endangered species list . The service listed the mouse as endangered on an emergency basis last month after 39 of the mice , believed to be the last surviving members of the species worldwide , were discovered in about four acres of coastal sagebrush on the Dana Point Headlands , a peninsula just north of Dana Point Harbor . The mouse habitat lies directly in the path of a proposed resort that would include a 400-room hotel complex and 394 homes to be built by Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co . and Chandis Securities Co . on 121 acres overlooking Dana Point Harbor . The mouse &quot; is part of California ' s natural heritage , &quot; Fred Roberts , a Fish and Wildlife Service botanist , said at the time . &quot; They are an important part of the ecology. &quot; The emergency listing gave officials 240 days -- or until Sept . 28 -- to decide whether to place the pocket_mouse permanently on the endangered species list . If that happens , Roberts said , the developers will not be allowed to proceed without first convincing the service that construction would not further endanger the mouse . &quot; They would have to come_up with a habitat conservation plan built into this project that would show it would allow enough room to satisfy the scientists that the species could survive there , &quot; said Connie Babb , a spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service . Chandis Securities , a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the Chandler family , is a principal stockholder of Times Mirror Co. , which publishes the Los Angeles Times . The pocket_mice , which had not been seen since 1971 , were rediscovered during a survey conducted by a biologist last July at the request of the Fish and Wildlife Service . Once common as far as two miles inland along the Southern California coast from Los Angeles County ' s Marina del Rey and El Segundo south to the Mexican border , the mouse -- believed to be the smallest member of the rodent family -- has fallen victim to development and hungry cats . &quot; The urbanization of the coast all but wiped them out , &quot; Roberts said . &quot; They ' ve probably been at the Dana Point Headlands the whole time , but nobody ' s looked_for them. &quot; Thursday ' s hearing was attended by about 25 people , seven of whom spoke in favor of the endangered designation for the mouse . No one spoke against it . &quot; Maybe the weather kept ( advocates of development ) away , &quot; Babb said . &quot; I am extremely surprised ; they have been extremely vocal. &quot; Dana Point ' s Tiny Mouse The Pacific pocket_mouse is only four to six inches long from its nose to the tip of its tail .</TEXT>
