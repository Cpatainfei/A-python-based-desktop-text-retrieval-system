   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : BLUE LIQUID IN DITCH BELIEVED TO BE DYE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After initial concern that 500 gallons of blue liquid found standing in a drainage_ditch south of Oxnard might be toxic_industrial_waste , authorities said Monday that they believe it is a type of dye used to color flowers . A state agriculture employee alerted the hazardous materials unit of the Ventura County Fire_Department at 10:30 a.m. after stumbling across the spill in a ditch by Nauman and Dufau roads , a department spokeswoman said.The liquid formed a pool 12 inches deep and a quarter of a mile long . The Fire_Department ' s hazardous materials team suited up in protective gear and used a long-handled probe to test the liquid before determining that it was harmless . Because trace amounts of copper were found in the liquid , investigators also believed that it might be a nontoxic fertilizer , said Steve Mattren , a Ventura County environmental health specialist . But after talking with area farmers , Mattren said he believes that the water-soluble substance is a dye used in the flower processing industry . No toxic gases were discovered and no evacuations were ordered , he said . PATRICK McCARTNEY</TEXT>
