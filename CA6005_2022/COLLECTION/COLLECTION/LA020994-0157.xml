   <HEADLINE> SWEET NOTHINGS ? ; ONCE AGAIN , SCIENCE SAYS SUGAR DOESN ' T AFFECT CHILDREN ' S BEHAVIOR . TRY TELLING THAT TO PARENTS WHOSE KIDS BOUNCE OFF WALLS AFTER EATING CANDY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was some bad news from the laboratory last week . Bad news , that is , if you are the parent , teacher or baby-sitter of a child who loves sugar . ( Good news , if you happen to be the child. ) Sugar , science now advises us , has nothing to do with how children behave . Empty calories ? Yes . Rotten for growing teeth ? Absolutely . But sugar does not , never has and never will cause temper tantrums , wild outbursts , the climbing of or the bouncing off walls . that ' s what science says . &quot; Well , would you like to know what I say ? &quot; growls one harried mother of twins . &quot; I say , they ' re nuts ! I say , ' Where were they last Christmas when my sons ate candy_canes and green frosting for days and never slept ? ' &quot; Apparently , they were not at_home with small children . Those who were say they ' re not sure they can swallow this latest report , published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine . And that includes some parents whose children participated in what has been billed as the sugar study to end all sugar studies . When asked about the outcome of the research on her son , Forrest , and 47 other kids , Linda Alexander of Iowa City , Iowa , is enthusiastic about the protocol : &quot; It was so wonderful not to have to cook ! They supplied all our meals for nine weeks . And we saved enough money on food to buy a play structure for the back yard. &quot; But Alexander , who says her 9-year-old son is so &quot; sugar-sensitive &quot; that for a time she was forced to padlock the family ' s sweets , is more cautious in her assessment of the findings . &quot; We believe that the results are accurate . . . as far as they go . We believe they need to continue looking_at this question. &quot; Not likely , say researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical_Center and the University of Iowa . &quot; A dead issue , &quot; says Dr. Judith Rapoport of the National Institute of Mental Health . The study , conducted in 1989 , is the latest of many to conclude that consuming large amounts of sugar does not make children hyperactive . The research involved 25 children ages 3 to 5 and 23 children ages 6 to 10 . The older children had been identified by their parents as sensitive to sugar . All food was removed from the families ' homes and replaced weekly with food prepared by the research team . The families spent three weeks on each of three diets -- one with sugar , one with NutraSweet and one with saccharin sweetening . Neither the families nor the researchers knew which diets they were_on . At the end of each week , the children ' s behavior was evaluated -- and no evidence was found that eating sugar made any difference . But mothers -- especially those whose children were not part of the study -- aren ' t buying its conclusions . After all , haven ' t they been hiding the Pop Tarts and rationing the Halloween candy for years ? &quot; Well , just because they ' ve said it again doesn ' t make_it any truer , does_it ? &quot; pouts Mary Ellen Gardner , a San Fernando Valley mother of five -- two of whom &quot; don ' t do_well on sugar. &quot; If those behavioral aberrations aren ' t coming from the sugar_bowl , worries Gardner and others , then where do they come from ? And , more importantly , what ' s to be done to curb them ? &quot; No such thing as a ' sugar high , ' no ' sugar rush ' ? Oh , right , &quot; says Henriette Gratteau , mother of 2-year-old twins in suburban Chicago . &quot; I know there is . When I want my boys to jump up and come_to the store , I toss them a couple Oreos . They wake right up. &quot; * There is no question that sugar can be a metabolic energizer . But that does not normally produce a behavioral change , experts say . The question is why parents ' anecdotal evaluations of their kids ' behavior are so different from that of unbiased researchers . Dr. Mark Wolraich , director of the latest sugar study , says the answer lies somewhere in the void between what parents believe and what can be proven in the laboratory . One respected body of research suggests that the extra attention given to children on sugar-restricted diets may do more to improve behavior than anything else . Other studies have ruled_out such demons as red dye and food_additives as contributors to less-than-optimal behavior . As recently as 1992 , Health magazine was defending sugar against its bad rap . &quot; In study after study , &quot; the magazine reported , &quot; behavior researchers have failed to confirm that sugar is guilty of anything worse than making children happy. &quot; The conclusion came_on the heels of research that at the time was considered the mother of all sugar studies . In that study , scientists equipped a group of preschool boys with &quot; actometers , &quot; little battery-powered belt packs to monitor their every jump , twitch and turn . Whether the boys were fed refined white sugar , glucose , saccharin or aspartame , the actometers ( as well as a team of observers ) revealed that the boys ' physical activity was the same as always . If there is a flaw in this latest study , parent-critics say , it may reside in the study ' s exclusion of chocolate from both the sugared and sugar-free diets of the subject children . &quot; No chocolate ? Are they serious ? &quot; asks Joe Garcia of Highland Park , a single parent of two boys . &quot; that ' s where my guys get most of their sweets from anyway . You can ' t study how they act_up until you see how they start carrying_on after a whole load of chocolate. &quot;</TEXT>
