   <HEADLINE> ED ROLLINS ' HARD ROAD TO REDEMPTION ; POLITICS : THE GOP CAMPAIGN COMMANDO ' S LOOSE TONGUE COST HIM DEARLY . BUT , LIKE A PHOENIX , HE ' S BACK -- AND WORKING WITH FIVE CANDIDATES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He ' s back . He ' s busy . And he wants redemption . Lesser operatives might have crumbled after such a spectacular collision with ignominy . They might have shriveled_up and died , metaphorically anyway , to find themselves consigned to the status of a David Letterman joke . Saddled with labels like &quot; liar &quot; and &quot; racist &quot; -- his own dark vision of how his post-New Jersey obituary might read -- others might have limped off to the Sahara of corporate communications , the political junkie ' s notion of hell itself . But not Ed Rollins . The man who in 1993 helped deliver New Jersey to Republican gubernatorial candidate Christine Todd Whitman is determined that this year , he will have a hand in turning_over a seat in the U.S. Senate from California to first-term Republican congressman Mike Huffington . At the same time , he ' s juggling four other GOP candidates in as_many states . He has resolved to restore his reputation , and to resurrect himself as the Republican_party ' s top non-elected vote-getter -- one of the few in his party , as he puts it , &quot; who knows the game now. &quot; Except that after the votes are counted -- after , if Rollins ' strategy holds true , Huffington defeats Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein -- don ' t look_for Rollins to attend too many media breakfasts . That was how he got_in trouble last time , boasting that the Whitman campaign had paid_out half a_million dollars to African American clergy and elected officials to help limit the turnout of predominantly Democratic black voters . &quot; My little crisis &quot; is how Rollins characterizes this particular debacle , or sometimes &quot; my little firestorm. &quot; His remarks the week after Whitman ' s big win landed him in front of a grand_jury , produced a two-month inquiry by the FBI and saw him sacked from his weekly stint as a political analyst for the &quot; Today &quot; show . The grand_jury and the FBI exonerated him ; &quot; Today &quot; did not invite him back . But the Huffingtons did . Never mind that Gov . Whitman has not spoken_to Rollins since his little crisis . The freshman congressman and his wife immediately called Rollins to commiserate . They took him to dinner , and over the entree , mentioned that one day soon , they might be needing his help . &quot; They were very kind , &quot; Rollins remembered . Quietly , he took_over as the Huffingtons ' chief strategist in early June . * Wistfulness is not generally a quality associated with someone who looks just like one of Santa ' s elves . Gazing out his one small window at the Huffington-for-Senate headquarters in Costa Mesa , Rollins -- short , round and bearded -- sounded momentarily pensive as he mused , &quot; If I could have that one paragraph back . . . . If I could answer the same question and have most of the facts stay the same . . . . &quot; He shook his head . He was flush with bravado when the words leaped_out , he said . Somehow , &quot; my mouth and my brain were not connected. &quot; It was a &quot; sin of arrogance , &quot; his own pet phrase for Rollinsgate , and it cost him . Big time . Not that this was the first time his loose tongue had been his undoing . Rollins is known as a guy who can rattle_off a catchy quote almost before the question is finished . But sometimes , as his occasional friend and frequent sparring_partner James Carville observed , &quot; he talks too much. &quot; In 1989 , for example , Rollins lost his job as head of the National Republican Congressional Committee after he urged GOP candidates to distance themselves from George_Bush . Rollins later retaliated by marketing his services to independent presidential candidate Ross Perot . But the New Jersey gaffe so shook Rollins that he sought solace in the Catholic_Church , from which he had been estranged off and on for decades . Experienced political hands contended that the racial overtones of Rollins ' comments about New Jersey were so damaging that he was washed_up in politics forever . But Rollins was not so sure . Soon enough , his desire for redemption saw him managing five campaigns in the 1994 season . But if he was starting to look_like the Lazarus of American political consultants -- risen again -- this was not an image the Feinstein camp was about to swallow . &quot; He hasn ' t risen yet , &quot; snapped Kam Kuwata , Feinstein ' s campaign manager . Politics is nothing if not nasty . But even in politics , theoretically , there are some minimal standards . &quot; For the first time in my life that I know of , I caused pain and anguish to others , &quot; Rollins said . On the other hand , though , &quot; I got her elected. &quot; And when the votes are in , so to speak , for a political consultant that ' s what counts . &quot; The political consultant is judged by only one yardstick : winning , &quot; said Larry Sabato , a University of Virginia government professor who wrote &quot; The Rise of Political Consultants &quot; ( Basic Books , 1981 ) . &quot; It ' s a commentary on our system when we value winning more_than we do ethics. &quot; Even the implication that Whitman ' s campaign strategists might have tried to pay black leaders not to turn_out in the race against Jim Florio is a reflection of &quot; the gutter level at which politics is conducted , &quot; charged University of Southern California law professor Susan Estrich , one of the primary architects of Michael Dukakis ' failed 1988 presidential bid . &quot; But if you ' re going to play in the gutter , &quot; Estrich continued , &quot; Ed ' s a good gutter player. &quot; Rollins , she said , &quot; does what he has to do to win . And what he has to do makes me want to take a shower. &quot; Carville , who ran Bill_Clinton ' s march to the White_House in 1992 and who managed Florio ' s losing campaign in New Jersey in 1993 , was less harsh . One post-New Jersey explanation that Rollins offered was that he had shot his mouth_off just to tweak Carville . His arch-rival had kept him up so many nights , it was almost as if he wanted to make him miss one night of sleep . But in their up-and-down relationship , that was then . Just last weekend , Rollins and Carville were back at it , jousting on &quot; Meet the Press. &quot; &quot; This is a good_guy who had a bad day , &quot; Carville said . &quot; Well , it was an awful day. &quot; * Carville and Rollins are master players in that merry band of political rogues , the consultants , a species that grows in influence with each election . Their job is to package candidates -- and to persuade the public to believe every single glowing half-truth they manufacture to accompany those candidates . The ability to rebound is hard-wired into their profession . Besides , Sabato said , &quot; There are so many scandals concerning the candidates , who has time for the scandals of the political consultants ? The public is scandal-saturated -- and the half-life of any scandal is very short. &quot; While insisting that &quot; the role that consultants have is so misunderstood , &quot; Rollins conceded that their antics often &quot; add_to the cynicism that Americans have about politics. &quot; He said he laments the philosophical mushiness of both major political_parties , and bemoans the fact that a candidate ' s &quot; message &quot; has been reduced to &quot; 30 seconds on TV. &quot; Nevertheless , said the man who -- with Jim Baker -- takes credit for engineering Ronald Reagan ' s 49-state triumph in 1984 , &quot; In the final analysis , you ' ve got_to play the game the way it is. &quot; In New Jersey , Rollins took particular joy in beating &quot; the White_House team. &quot; The race was closely watched , in large part because of the consultants who were running it . &quot; It became Rollins and Carville , &quot; Rollins said , &quot; not Whitman and Florio. &quot; By suggesting after the election that African American ministers and officeholders might be influenced by payoffs , Rollins did &quot; an awful thing , &quot; Carville said -- but that isn ' t enough to drum him out of the business . &quot; Criminality finishes_off careers , that kind of stuff . that ' s for candidates , &quot; Carville said . &quot; He wasn ' t convicted of anything. &quot; Still , after the New Jersey firestorm , &quot; I didn ' t want to do any more races , &quot; Rollins said . &quot; Even though it was a self-inflicted wound , I don ' t like the public part of it . That was very public. &quot; Rollins was radioactive , and he said he tried to steer away the first candidates who called him after the New Jersey election . When George R . Nethercutt Jr . telephoned to say he was thinking_of challenging House Speaker Thomas Foley in Spokane , Rollins said , &quot; ' George , the last thing you need is me , ' &quot; Rollins recalled . But Rollins did take_on the Nethercutt race , and recent polls show that Foley is in big trouble . Rollins is also serving as consultant to Long_Island hide-a-bed heiress Bernadette Castro , the Republican challenger to Sen . Daniel Patrick Moynihan in New York . Another 1994 election client is Bruce Benson , whose race against Democratic Gov . Roy Romer of Colorado was looking good until word leaked_out that Benson had been arrested for drunk driving and was embroiled in a sex scandal . And in Texas , Rollins is counseling comptroller candidate Teresa Doggett , an African American . Rollins also advised another African American candidate , Joe Watkins , who was defeated in the primary in his bid for Pennsylvania ' s Republican Senate nomination . To Rollins , who in his youthful days as a Democrat was an early supporter of California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown , these assignments prove that many African American candidates -- and , presumably , voters -- are willing to look beyond his utterances about New Jersey . Not so , said Mayor Elihu Harris of Oakland , one of California ' s largest blocks of urban black voters . Black voters were &quot; victimized &quot; by Rollins ' tactics in New Jersey , Harris said , and forgiveness may_not be so swift . Catholic theologian Michael Novak , who holds the George Frederick Jewett chair in religion and public policy at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington , said Rollins ' own admission that he had bent the truth by &quot; repeating rumors &quot; in New Jersey should not be easily dismissed . &quot; There are some sins that have a dimension we don ' t give enough credibility to , &quot; Novak said . &quot; It ' s not just what you did to yourself , but what you ' ve done to other people , and especially when it comes_to truth . You can ' t get an untruth back . I think this is why the black ministers were so mad at Rollins. &quot; But if there ' s damage , Novak said , &quot; it ' s also to the system . To discredit the system seems triply bad. &quot; For Rollins , it seems , the tainting that Novak and others refer to hurts the most . &quot; The connotations of dirt and sleaze are what bother me , &quot; Rollins said over lunch recently . &quot; It ' s not who I am . It ' s not who I want to be. &quot; Who he is , is a 51-year-old former boxer who did not take_off his gloves until he had lost too many teeth to count -- and until finally , just once , he couldn ' t spring back from the mat . Rollins grew_up in Vallejo , Calif. , and did not part_with what he maintains are firmly blue-collar Democratic roots until he fell_under the spell of Ronald Reagan in the 1960s . But even after he followed Reagan to Washington , working in the White_House and then managing the 1984 reelection campaign , he remained a spiritual Californian . In fact , said Sherrie Rollins , her husband ' s ties to his native state were what made the Huffington campaign so attractive . &quot; The last thing he needed was another campaign , &quot; she said . &quot; The reason he did California was because it was California. &quot; Of course , the fact that Huffington was waging a come-from-behind fight added_to Rollins ' interest , as did the apparently endless amount_of_money Huffington was spending . Estrich , for one , said it is common for a consultant to charge 15 % of the total amount spent on a campaign . At last count , Huffington ' s bid for the Senate was expected to cost about $ 30 million . But Sherrie Rollins , who is 36 and a senior_vice_president of ABC in New York , said she worried that her husband might be overextending himself . Twelve years ago , Ed Rollins was nearly killed by a stroke , the apparent legacy of a head injury from boxing . Now , she said , &quot; I really was worried about him physically doing_it . I kept saying , ' How could you put one more thing on your plate when you ' re spread so thin as it is ? ' &quot; The Rollinses met while she was working in the Bush White_House , a job she left when her husband signed_on -- briefly -- to work with Ross Perot in 1992 . It was her first marriage ; he had a brief marriage years before . From the &quot; New Jersey incident , &quot; as she refers to it , she learned that &quot; he puts everything in perspective . His attitude was , at least one of his dogs didn ' t die . Not to mention his wife. &quot; She laughed . The fallout from New Jersey also sent Ed Rollins back to church . After decades of religious ambivalence -- occasionally going_back to church , but leaving again just as quickly -- he has missed only three Sundays in church in the last year , Sherrie Rollins said . For the first time since his boyhood , Rollins declared , &quot; I am now a practicing Catholic. &quot; But many members of his faith might argue that penitence constitutes more_than a_few weeks of ugly press accounts . Sinners , said theologian Novak , must pay a price . &quot; That begins with penitence , &quot; he said , and involves &quot; mortification and rethinking ( of the sin ) , and that means publicly and privately being questioned. &quot; For Rollins , a victory in California would represent more_than just a comeback . This time , he hopes it will bring a resurrection of sorts . But cruising the freeway back to Huffington headquarters , Rollins allowed that it may be time to do now what many people assumed he would do a year ago : Walk away . He and Sherrie would like to start a family , he said , and so after this election he plans to move from suburban Washington to New York to be with her full-time . &quot; I think this is my last round , &quot; he volunteered . &quot; I think I have kind of really gotten my fill of it this time. &quot; But even campaign commando Ed Rollins seems unconvinced . New Jersey notwithstanding , he said , &quot; This is probably what I do best. &quot;</TEXT>
