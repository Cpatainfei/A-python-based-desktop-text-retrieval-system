   <HEADLINE> CONSUMER BRIEFS : TIPS FOR SPOTTING SUSPICIOUS PARCELS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the wake of a mail bombing that killed an advertising executive in New Jersey earlier this month , the security firm Kroll Associates has released tips on spotting suspicious packages . The indications of a mail bomb fall_into five categories : * Weight and appearance . Excessive weight for size ; uneven or lopsided shape ; bulkier than normal ; soft_spots or bulges ; oil_stains or greasy marks on the wrapper ; small hole in the wrapper ; protruding wires , metal or string . Size may vary widely , from cigarette-carton dimensions on up . * Packaging . Wrapper suggests previous use , such_as traces of glue or old mailing labels ; unprofessional wrapping , use of excessive or several combinations of tape ; endorsements such_as &quot; Fragile -- Handle With Care , &quot; &quot; Personal and Confidential &quot; or &quot; Rush -- Do Not Delay. &quot; * Postage-Addressing . Excessive or inadequate postage ; origin and sender unfamiliar to recipient ; no return_address ; postmark is different city than return_address ; unusual return_address format , such_as homemade label , cut-and-paste lettering , rub-on block_lettering ; name and title of addressee inaccurate ; distorted handwriting ; misspelling of common words . May be sent by U.S. Postal Service , express delivery services , messenger or may be placed physically at the delivery site . * Unusual characteristics . Package makes buzzing , ticking , rattling or sloshing sound ; emits peculiar odor . * Contents . Pressure or resistance in removing the contents ; visual distractions inside , such_as currency or pornography . &quot; If through these or other clues you suspect a letter or package may be harmful , do not open the item , but isolate it , secure the immediate area and immediately notify your company ' s security_director and-or local law_enforcement authorities , &quot; said John T . Horn , director of Kroll ' s corporate security department . The package should not be immersed in water , he said , but rather placed where it is easily accessible to bomb squad personnel . Windows should be opened in the immediate area to help vent fumes from an explosion or the emission of a harmful gas .</TEXT>
