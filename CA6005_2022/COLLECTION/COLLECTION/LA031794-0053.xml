   <HEADLINE> TOPICS / BRIEFLY ; ART : GETTY MODEL AIDS MUMMY PRESERVATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Getty Conservation Institute ' s innovative design of a case for maintaining mummies and other fragile organic materials was used as a model recently by an Egyptian museum to restore the Royal Mummies to public view . The case sustains an environment that stems the erosion of mummies by preventing microbiological activity . Using the Getty prototype , the Egyptian Antiquities Organization in Cairo built nine cases for the Egyptian Museum that employ a nitrogen atmosphere and a system for monitoring temperature , humidity and oxygen levels . The Egyptian cases were based on the Getty ' s 1987 prototype , for which scientists used an anonymous mummy dubbed &quot; Lady X &quot; to develop a way to display and store mummies and other fragile organic materials . After much experimentation , the scientists developed a case in which a nitrogen atmosphere capable of halting microbiological activity could be sustained without mechanical or electrical_systems . The Royal Mummies exhibit opened March 1 at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo . &quot; Although the Getty Conservation Institute was not involved in the actual construction or testing of the Egyptian Museum ' s cases , I am delighted that our research has been instrumental in helping the museum achieve its goal of safeguarding the Royal Mummies , &quot; said Miguel Angel Corzo , Getty Conservation Institute director .</TEXT>
