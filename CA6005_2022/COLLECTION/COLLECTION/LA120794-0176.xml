   <HEADLINE> TONS OF PLUTONIUM ARE STORED UNSAFELY , U.S. SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Energy_Department is storing tons of plutonium in unsafe plastic containers and other packages , some of which are bulging from pressurized hydrogen gas that has accumulated as radioactive plutonium deteriorates , a senior department official said Tuesday . The containers , located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near San Francisco and other sites across the nation , are at risk of bursting and contaminating workers with cancer-causing plutonium , Assistant Energy_Secretary Tara O ' Toole said . Energy officials said Tuesday the agency has begun an immediate program to replace all_of the suspect plastic containers within 12 months . Newly designed containers would be good for an estimated 50 years , by which time the agency hopes to find a permanent way to dispose_of the plutonium . The containers -- which include ordinary food cans -- are part of a broad safety and environmental problem posed by the nation ' s inventory of 26 metric_tons of plutonium , left from four decades of nuclear bomb production . Although awareness of plutonium safety risks has increased gradually over the last three years , a massive 26-volume assessment released Tuesday by the Energy_Department provides significant new evidence that conditions are more serious than was previously thought , according to government and private experts . &quot; Overall , the department ' s inventory of plutonium presents significant hazards to workers , the public and environment and little progress has been made to aggressively address the problem , &quot; according to an Energy_Department report . The report found hazards at nearly every major site in the nuclear_weapons complex , identifying 299 specific environmental , health and safety problems . &quot; Buildings and equipment that are aging , poorly maintained or of obsolete design contribute to the overall problem , &quot; the report noted . &quot; It is a more serious problem than we knew of before , &quot; said Daryl Kimball , associate director at Physicians for Social Responsibility , a watchdog group on nuclear issues . &quot; Some of these facilities are an accident waiting to happen. &quot; The report found that the most serious problems exist at the Rocky Flats plant near Denver , which has 12.8 metric_tons of plutonium stored in 10 buildings with serious fire , ventilation , and industrial equipment problems . The report ranked its other &quot; most vulnerable &quot; sites in descending order as Savannah_River , S.C. ; Hanford , Wash. ; Los Alamos , N.M. , and Livermore . When the Cold_War ended , bomb output was abruptly cut_off and the normal movement of plutonium in the production process came_to a halt . As a result , plutonium was left in various containers that were never intended for long-term storage , O ' Toole said . The most serious risks are those posed by 400 # 000 liters of plutonium stored in liquid form , which can leak or become concentrated enough to set_off a nuclear chain_reaction . Plutonium powders , oxides and ashes also pose serious storage problems because they are unstable , corrosive and can burn spontaneously . Among the containers used to store plutonium are plastic bottles , plastic bags , cardboard cartons , metal_drums and even food cans , the report said . The Energy_Department has 8.7 metric_tons of its plutonium inventory stored in the form of scraps or residues in 34 # 000 various packages , of which 300 are located at Livermore . The report noted that eight plutonium packages at Livermore had recently swelled because of hydrogen gas buildup caused by radioactive_decay and moisture buildup .</TEXT>
