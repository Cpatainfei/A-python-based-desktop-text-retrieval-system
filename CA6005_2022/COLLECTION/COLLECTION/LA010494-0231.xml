   <HEADLINE> SEERS USE STARS , STATS TO DIVINE O.C. FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s time to check the final score . A year ago , Esmael Adibi , the head of Chapman University ' s Center for Economic Research in Orange , and astrologer Laura Rose DesJardins , the owner of Astro-Forecast in Costa Mesa , agreed to match wits and predict what 1993 had in_store for us all . Both came well recommended . Adibi and his crew of academic number crunchers have made predictions for years about Orange County ' s economy for local business_leaders . And for 21 years , DesJardins has made a decent living discreetly searching the stars and calculating their influence on business for boardrooms across Orange County . The past recession-weary year was no cakewalk for anyone in the prognosticating field . Economic crystal balls grew cloudy with a new Administration in Washington pushing for sweeping changes in trade , health_care and tariffs . Still , our local prognosticators did fairly well on their predictions about how Orange County in_general and four broad industry sectors would fare in 1993 . They also looked_into the future again to see what this year holds . They erred on two significant points in 1993 . Each side humbly claims undisputed victory over the other , but you , the readers , should decide if knowing the configurations of Pluto and Saturn are as accurate as knowing the county ' s gross_domestic_product and local unemployment trends . ORANGE COUNTY Orange County pretty much remained in the dumps all year . Layoffs were legion -- about 15 # 000 jobs were lost in 1993 -- and many businesses were forced to rethink how they operate . But Adibi and DesJardins said the county was going_to continue suffering only until mid-1993 , then job losses were to give_way to growth . They also predicted that increased foreign trade was going_to lay a patina of hope over Orange County ' s dull economic landscape . Uh huh . Sorry , guys . It didn ' t matter that Orange County ' s astrological sign is Leo and that it was being influenced by Sagittarius or that the gross_national_product grew 4.4 % by the fourth quarter and that taxable sales were up 3.6 % . Orange County was still in a slump . &quot; That is one area in which I kind of blew it , &quot; Adibi said . &quot; But we both did. &quot; What neither counted_on was that corporate_executives , shaken by the uncertainty of health_care reform , deferred hiring until they get a better idea what effect reform will have_on their payrolls . DesJardins ' and Adibi ' s predictions about new foreign trade opportunities also were a bit premature . But that is changing rapidly , according to their predictions for this year . &quot; Orange County is taking_on a whole new image and is revitalizing itself , &quot; DesJardins said , pointing_out that Saturn and Neptune will play significant positive roles in the year ahead . &quot; The old image is ending completely. &quot; Adibi takes a more conservative posture . &quot; President Clinton ' s tax package has significant contractionary fiscal implications associated with it , particularly in the first_half of this year when the higher tax_liabilities need to be paid , &quot; he said . In other words , expect another bearish year for Orange County . HIGH_TECHNOLOGY That was the only area in which the two forecasters differed significantly . DesJardins said that the high-tech industry , fueled by a conjunction of Uranus and Neptune , would be_on the upswing in 1993 ; Adibi gave it a thumbs down . Sorry , DesJardins , your worthy opponent wins this one . The high-tech industry ended_up losing 5 # 000 jobs , largely caused by continued cutbacks in defense . In fact , Adibi said , expect more to come . In mid-December , for instance , Rockwell International Corp . said it plans to cut an additional 500 jobs from its Seal Beach and Downey plants . Other defense_contractors looking_to downsize or convert to commercial production face similar fates . &quot; Clearly , we don ' t need that much defense , &quot; Adibi said . In her defense , DesJardins points_out that she didn ' t receive information to chart defense firms in 1993 . She notes that she accurately predicted a rise in computer companies in 1993 . DesJardins points_out that companies such_as AST Research Inc. in Irvine , which makes computer_hardware , have done_well overall . Vice_President Al Gore visited AST in September , praising its corporate restructuring , and then took time for a photo with AST Chief_Executive Safi Qureshey . As a footnote , DesJardins accurately predicted last year that Roger Johnson , head of Western Digital Inc. in Irvine , would leave the firm for bigger and better things . He was tapped by President Clinton in July to be chief of the General Services_Agency . Her tidbit for the future was not reported in last year ' s story because -- hey ! Who would have believed it ? HEALTH_CARE It was a safe bet for both to predict last year that the health_care industry was poised to receive a welcome boost under Clinton ' s reform proposal . Health_maintenance_organizations Pacifi-Care Health Systems Inc. in Cypress and FHP Inc. in Fountain Valley had stellar years in membership growth and revenue . But HMOs aside , the county ' s overall health_care sector didn ' t grow as aggressively as either had predicted . Only about 500 jobs were gained for the county , largely because of job cuts at medical device makers Beckman Instruments Inc. in Fullerton , Allergan Inc. in Irvine and drug distributor Bergen Brunswig Corp . in Orange . &quot; Even HMOs are not even sure which ones will be around in the future , &quot; said Adibi . &quot; There is a real vagueness out there. &quot; In fact , both said recently , this year will be painful for the industry . Continued job losses , Adibi said , will cut_into managed care membership and will trickle down to hurt the fast growth of HMOs . DesJardins agrees , what with that pesky Saturn moving_into the sun at_the_same_time Pluto is moving_into Saturn . &quot; It ' s a whole new chart , &quot; she said . &quot; It looks_like a double whammy. &quot; TOURISM AND ENTERTAINMENT The tourism and entertainment_industry , including lodging and food services , showed a_few more signs of life than real_estate , defense and other major industries . That , after all , is what Adibi and DesJardins both predicted . Adibi said the industry took_in 2 % more revenue than it did_in 1992 , mainly driven by visitors from other areas of the country where the economy is reviving . But what he didn ' t predict was that employment was flat . Businesses &quot; got more out of existing workers by offering overtime instead of hiring new employees , &quot; Adibi said . The stars will continue to be good for the industry this year because of the influence of the constellation Sagittarius , DesJardins predicted . And even Disney will benefit from the moon moving_into Neptune , making a major positive decision by mid-year . After all , Neptune represents image . Disney , of course , needs to make a decision soon on whether to continue its $ 3-billion plan to expand Disneyland in Anaheim into a resort , complete with a Westcot theme park . The plans were thrown_in doubt after the company lost $ 514 million on its Euro Disney park in Paris for its fiscal_year ended Sept . 30 . REAL_ESTATE &quot; What more can we say ? &quot; Adibi said , shaking his head . &quot; We were right about real estate. &quot; Indeed , the continuing decline in the real_estate market might have been an easy pick for anyone to make . In fact , the average home price dropped an additional 3.3 % for 1993 -- on top of a 1.4 % drop for 1992 . Last year , Adibi attributed his prediction to the simple proposition that unemployed folks were not interested in taking_out home loans , even if home prices and interest_rates were at their lowest levels in years . DesJardins said the source of the problem was grander than that . It was the fact that Saturn , Neptune and Uranus were all_in Capricorn , a configuration that represented limitations , restrictions , losses and delays . Is it over ? Not on your life , both said . DesJardins said to wait at least another year , when all three planets reposition themselves to a more lucrative configuration . So there you have it . Is stargazing -- DesJardins calls it cosmic biology -- as accurate as the number-crunching computers at Chapman University ? That is for you to decide . The better question could be : Why go_through the exercise of forecasting at all ? Both Adibi and DesJardins defend the practice as vital to employers , who must chart courses for their enterprises , and to employees , who need help making valuable decisions about personal finances such_as home purchases and other investments . &quot; It ' s an awesome responsibility , &quot; Adibi said , noting that picking_up the right trends is the most difficult part of forecasting . &quot; But I think we did excellently . Only I did better. &quot; Humph ! says DesJardins . She points_out that she did just as well with her general predictions and better with such specific prognostications as Roger Johnson ' s departure from Western Digital .</TEXT>
