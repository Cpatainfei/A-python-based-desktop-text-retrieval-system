   <HEADLINE> THE SECRET LIFE OF FURNITURE ; OBJECTS OF DESIRE : THE LIVES OF ANTIQUES AND THOSE WHO PURSUE THEM , BY THATCHER FREUND ( PANTHEON : $ 24 ; 291 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The urge to collect starts early in life -- one Barbie doll soon leads to another and another , and , before you know it , you ' ve got a whole drawerful of the 11 1 / 2-inch arched-eyebrowed , plastic , pony-tailed teen-agers . A hobby has become a habit . There are no bounds when it comes_to collecting . All you need is the courage of your convictions and a little cash , or a lot , if you are one of the people who flock to New York every January for the Americana auctions and the Winter Antiques Show on Park_Avenue held the same week . A dealer spends as much as $ 30 # 000 in fees to sell at the glitzy Americana show . This is actually cheap , considering the number of people who might spend $ 1 million on a single piece of American furniture , including Eddy Nicholson , former chairman of the Congoleum Corp. , actor Bill Cosby and Dallas billionaire Robert Bass , who once paid $ 12.1 million for a Newport secretary-bookcase . Even with $ 30 # 000 , it ' s not easy to become a seller at that show : A dealer currently exhibiting there would first have to die . In &quot; Objects of Desire : The Lives of Antiques and Those Who Pursue Them , &quot; Thatcher Freund focuses_on three pieces of 18th-Century American furniture on offer during a single day in January , 1991 : a blue blanket chest that once stored socks and underwear , offered at the Winter Antiques Show for $ 245 # 000 ; a rare ball-and-claw-foot Chippendale card_table , forgotten for 60 years in a dark basement until the grandson of its original owner discovered it , estimated to bring $ 1 million at the Americana auction at Sotheby ' s , and a federal inlaid , drop-leaf sofa table , a prized piece from a Massachusetts collector forced by the recession to sell his antiques , valued at $ 100 # 000 , also on display at Sotheby ' s . &quot; Things lead lives like people do , &quot; writes Freund ( ungrammatically ! ) , &quot; and they prosper , like people , on the strength of their character. &quot; While &quot; Objects of Desire &quot; is partly about antiques and immortality , it is really a story about collectors and why they ' ll do practically anything to remain in the hunt . Judging from the cast of characters Freund introduces , you get the impression that a prized table is no different from a prized terrier . What ' s really at stake are egos , and the need to win . Freund writes_about Joseph Hirshhorn , the 5-foot , 3-inch uranium magnate , who would shout : &quot; How much is this ? How much is this ? How much is that ? How much for the whole_lot ? &quot; and buy 40 or 50 things at once . He writes_about Connecticut antiques dealer David Schorsch , who shopped_at Mr. Guy of Beverly Hills because that ' s where Jeopardy host Alex Trebeck got his clothes . A blockfront-furniture expert by the age of 7 , Schorsch paid outrageous prices for American folk_art just to get people to notice him . Great antiques , like great_dogs , are valued for provenance . And certain collectors and dealers trade on that allure . About Mario Buatta , the &quot; Prince of Chintz &quot; decorator who single-handedly turned the Winter Antiques Show into a major social_event , Freund describes a panel_discussion Buatta moderated . Three hundred women paid $ 35 a piece to listen to famous decorators discuss decorating with antiques . &quot; ( The ladies ) seemed to care less about what made one antique unique and another not , than about the way such things fit together . They wanted history right then . They didn ' t want to wait two hundred years to have it . Mario Buatta was happy to oblige . He knew it was his job not to help others connect to the past , but to invent a past . ' A lot of us didn ' t inherit these things , ' he explained that day to his admirers . ' But we want our houses to look that way . that ' s what we all want to strive for. ' &quot; The author knows it too . He also knows certain individuals will do just about anything to buy -- and even more to sell -- a piece of the past . He tells of auctioneers who pretend to have other bidders when there are none . He tells of how a Sotheby ' s deal with an old-monied family to sell the $ 1 million card_table required full-page color ads of the table in antique magazines , a meal to be served to the family by Sotheby ' s chef Bernard , a suite of four rooms to be taken at the Carlyle Hotel and catalogues to be mailed free to the widow for life . He writes_about dealers who distract the competition at auctions to keep prices down . And he describes how some Ohio dealers discovered that while they had no trouble finding antiques made by Ohio craftsmen , few people actually wanted them ; &quot; As a result . . . when clients asked about a piece , the dealer would sometimes say , ' The people who owned it moved from Pennsylvania. ' &quot; The book has its faults . Freund plows back and forth in time , filling_in the historical gaps with theories . Instead of identifying the owner of the Chippendale table , Freund refers to him coyly as &quot; a man whom we will call Tom Hughes . The Hugheses come from the sort of old Philadelphia family that prefers not to see its name printed in any context besides those of marriage and death , and asks researchers to oblige. &quot; Oh , really . And perhaps they got no thrill from seeing their furniture biographied in this book ? And where are the pictures ? Two of the pieces_of_furniture are shown on the jacket , but the other is covered in sheeting . It would be nice also to see what some of the collectors and dealers look_like . Freund ' s portrait of the antiques world -- the craftsmen , the wealthy , eccentric collectors , the rough , competitive dealers characterized by ego and obsession is a clever examination of an incurable disease . Reading about antiques , though , is not nearly as much fun as buying them . Still , it ' s better than having to walk a Schnauzer .</TEXT>
