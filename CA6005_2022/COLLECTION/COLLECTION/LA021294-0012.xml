   <HEADLINE> SEOUL WOULD SUPPORT N . KOREA SANCTIONS ; ASIA : FOREIGN_MINISTER SAYS SOUTH_KOREA WOULD BACK U.N. ACTION TO FORCE NUCLEAR INSPECTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After meeting with top U.S. officials , the South_Korean foreign_minister said Friday that his country will support tough international sanctions against North_Korea if the U.N. Security_Council decides to take such measures . The Security_Council is expected to rule soon -- after a meeting Feb . 20 of the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency -- on whether to impose sanctions against North_Korea for barring international inspections of its nuclear installations . The Vienna-based agency is likely to declare that it cannot guarantee North_Korea is not diverting nuclear fuel for weapons purposes and thus is in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The CIA has said it believes that North_Korea already has developed the technology to assemble a nuclear bomb and may have built one or two . Until now , the South_Korean government has been cautious about appearing hostile toward its northern neighbor and has avoided openly condoning sanctions against North_Korea for failing to comply with the international agency ' s requests . The dispute is over inspections of seven nuclear installations , which North_Korea says are being used for peaceful purposes . But on Friday , in answer to a question about how the Seoul government would respond if the Security_Council chose to take punitive measures , Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo said , &quot; We will support and respect the decision and measures the United Nations will take. &quot; He suggested , however , that some milder measures might be possible initially . &quot; The choice may_not be between doing nothing and imposing very harsh sanctions from the beginning , &quot; Han said . His remarks seemed to hint that South_Korea might support proposals for the imposition of gradual sanctions against North_Korea that would be less formal and less severe than U.N. sanctions . These gradual sanctions could include a reduction of oil supplies to North_Korea and steps by Japan to hamper the ability of North_Koreans to send home money that they earn in Tokyo and other Japanese cities . In an apparent effort to calm the concerns in his country and in North_Korea over recent publications about the Pentagon ' s readiness to do battle with the Asian_nation , Han said that &quot; the war scares are not warranted by the existing situation. &quot; The United States has been increasing the diplomatic pressure on North_Korea in an effort to force it to comply with the inspections . Earlier this month , the Clinton_Administration gave preliminary approval to a plan to send Patriot antimissile batteries to South_Korea to strengthen U.S. forces there and help discourage any possible attacks by North_Korea . Han said that consultations between the United States and South_Korea on the Patriots are ongoing and declined to comment on whether his government would support their deployment . The crisis over the North_Korean nuclear program began a year ago , when the IAEA told Pyongyang that it wanted to inspect two waste sites where it believes North_Korea has hidden waste_materials produced when it secretly reprocessed plutonium for weapons purposes . North_Korea responded by announcing its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .</TEXT>
