   <HEADLINE> ABORTION CLINIC BUFFER AGAINST PROTEST UPHELD ; SUPREME COURT : LIMITED BAN TO PRESERVE PATIENTS ' RIGHTS DOES NOT VIOLATE FIRST_AMENDMENT , JUSTICES SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a victory for abortion rights advocates , the Supreme Court said Thursday that judges and lawmakers can create a &quot; buffer zone &quot; around an abortion clinic and prevent protesters from picketing and chanting on the street and sidewalks in front of the facility . This limited ban on peaceful protest does not violate the First_Amendment ' s guarantee of freedom_of_speech , the court ruled on a 6-3 vote , as long as it is deemed necessary to preserve the patient ' s right to freely enter a clinic . But a Florida judge went too far , the court said , when he barred protesters from holding_up photos of aborted fetuses and prohibited them from seeking to speak with any patient or staff_member within 300 feet of a clinic in Melbourne , Fla . Those restrictions on free speech &quot; sweep more broadly than necessary &quot; to protect access to the clinic and therefore are unconstitutional , the justices said . The decision was one of several announced on the last_day of the high_court ' s 1993-94 term . In other rulings , the justices : * Limited the 1965 Voting Rights Act by ruling that states need not create the maximum possible number of legislative seats for blacks and Latinos . * Struck down a $ 52-million contempt fine assessed against the United Mine Workers and said such criminal-like punishments can only be imposed by a jury , not by a judge alone . The court ' s opinion in the abortion protest case is likely to have a wide impact , not only on the continuing battle over abortion , but also on emerging areas of street protests , such_as those by AIDS activists who have targeted Catholic_church officials and by animal-rights advocates who have tried to shut medical research labs . When faced with aggressive and persistent protesters , judges have been forced to draw_a_line dividing protected free speech from illegal harassment and interference with the rights of others . Thursday ' s ruling ( Madsen vs . Women ' s Health Center , 93-880 ) marks the high_court ' s first detailed pronouncement on the issue , which has arisen in scores of cases involving abortion clinics . The case arose from the long-running battle outside the Aware Woman Center in Melbourne , on the central Florida coast south of Cape Canaveral . The leaders of Operation Rescue , an anti-abortion group , had pledged to shut the clinic through round-the-clock protests . The clinic ' s owner complained that her patients and staff suffered under &quot; mob rule. &quot; But the abortion opponents said the First_Amendment protected their right to picket , pray and chant on the street and the sidewalk next to the clinic . Last year , faced with evidence that the protesters were continually impeding patients ' right to enter the clinic , a state judge imposed a broad injunction . It created a 36-foot buffer zone outside the clinic ' s driveway . Police were told to arrest any protester who picketed , prayed or even walked in that area . The judge also barred loud chanting during surgical hours and prohibited the display of signs and photos that might upset patients . In addition , he said protesters must stay 300 feet from the homes of the clinic ' s patients and employees . Writing for the court , Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist upheld part of the injunction and struck_down other parts . In doing so , he announced several important clarifications of the law . First , a judge ' s order is not unconstitutional simply because it targets a particular group of protesters and restricts their free-speech rights . An injunction &quot; by its very nature &quot; targets people who probably are attempting to convey a similar message , Rehnquist said . Abortion protesters were targeted at the Florida clinic , he said , not because of &quot; their anti-abortion message ( but ) because they repeatedly violated &quot; earlier court_orders . Second , injunctions can be upheld if they are no broader &quot; than necessary to serve a significant governmental interest. &quot; In this case , officials had &quot; a strong interest in protecting a woman ' s freedom to seek lawful medical and counseling services in connection with her pregnancy , &quot; he said . Third , any person whose words or actions &quot; could be interpreted as threats or veiled threats &quot; is not protected from punishment under the First_Amendment , Rehnquist declared . Most states , including California , recently have enacted laws against &quot; stalking. &quot; But some legal_experts have questioned whether it is constitutional to make_it a crime to follow someone or to harass them with unwanted comments . Rehnquist ' s opinion suggests that anti-stalking laws can be upheld when there is evidence of threatening behavior . However , he also struck_down part of the Melbourne injunction that protected clinic workers from being stalked or &quot; shadowed &quot; at all times and in all locations , calling this too broad an infringement on free speech . &quot; Absent evidence that the protesters ' speech . . . is infused with violence . . . or a threat of physical harm , &quot; it cannot be made illegal , the chief_justice said . Fourth , injunctions can restrict noise_levels to protect the welfare of patients but cannot restrict signs and posters . &quot; It is much easier for the clinic to pull_up its curtains than for a patient to stop_up her ears , &quot; he said . Fifth , an injunction can ban &quot; targeted residential picketing &quot; directly in front of a doctor ' s home but it cannot go so far as_to prohibit any picketing in the neighborhood . The Melbourne injunction went too far , he said , when it barred any protest activities within 300 feet of an employee ' s residence . Lawyers said the ruling appears to clear_up any constitutional doubts about the newly enacted federal law designed to protect access to abortion clinics . The law , signed by President Clinton in spring , makes_it a federal crime to block access to a clinic or to intimidate women seeking abortions . The law already has been challenged on free-speech grounds . The court ' s ruling &quot; is a slam-dunk win for women , doctors and health_care workers , &quot; said Eleanor Smeal , president of the Feminist Majority Foundation , which helped defend the Melbourne clinic . But Nancy Skinner , a co-chair for Pro-Choice Orange County , says the decision is not a clear-cut victory for either side . &quot; We ' re obviously pleased that access will be improved , &quot; Skinner said . &quot; But they can still show their ugly pictures and talk to women before they get_to the free zone. &quot; Lawyers for anti-abortion protesters said the ruling has &quot; devastating consequences for the pro-life movement. &quot; &quot; Part of today ' s Supreme Court opinion has transformed public sidewalks normally open for expressive activity into a type of Tian An Men Square , &quot; said Mat Staver , an Orlando , Fla. , attorney who represented the three abortion protesters who had challenged the injunction . In a vehement dissent , which he read from the bench , Justice Antonin Scalia accused his colleagues of making abortion protesters a &quot; disfavored class &quot; who were not accorded the same free-speech protections as labor picketers and civil_rights protesters . Justices Anthony M . Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined in Scalia ' s dissent . Although Rehnquist and Scalia are usually linked as the conservative leaders of the high_court , they have differed often on the First_Amendment . The chief_justice usually sides with the government , regardless of the issue , but Scalia has often insisted on broad protection for free speech . Five years ago , Scalia cast a key vote to strike_down laws against flag-burning as a violation of free expression , while Rehnquist dissented strongly . Earlier this week , Rehnquist cast a key vote to uphold some regulation of cable_television , while Scalia said he would strike_down the rules as a violation of free speech . The ruling in the mine worker ' s case also involved a challenge to a judge ' s order . In a 9-0 decision , the justices put new limits on the power of judges to issue fines for contempt . Although judges can force an organization to pay_for losses it has caused , they cannot punish someone without a jury trial , the court said in the case ( International Union vs . Bagwell , 92-1625 ) . * Times staff writer Tammerlin Drummond contributed to this report .</TEXT>
