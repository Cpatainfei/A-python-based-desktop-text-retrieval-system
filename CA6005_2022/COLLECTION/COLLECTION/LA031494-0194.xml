   <HEADLINE> ' SCHINDLER ' S ' ADDS A PAIR TO THE LIST ; AWARDS : SPIELBERG EPIC TAKES MORE HONORS -- FOR SCREENWRITING AND EDITING . JANE CAMPION ' S ' THE PIANO ' ALSO WINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the 66th Academy Awards a week away , Steven Spielberg ' s &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; continued to dominate the film awards season over the weekend , adding honors for screenwriting and editing to its already impressive array of prizes . Clearly , the stage is set for &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; to sweep the Academy Awards , with more_than a possibility that the movie will win Oscars in all 12 categories for which it was nominated , including best motion_picture of 1993 . In ceremonies Sunday night at the Beverly Hilton , the Writers Guild of America gave Steven Zaillian ' s script the prize for best 1993 screenplay based on material previously produced or published . The film was based on the novel by Thomas Keneally about World_War_II Nazi industrialist Oskar Schindler , who employed Jews in his factory and kept them from death in Nazi-run concentration_camps . Jane Campion ' s script for &quot; The Piano &quot; won the Writers Guild award for best screenplay written directly for the screen . &quot; The Piano , &quot; which Campion also directed and for which she became only the second woman in Academy Awards history to receive an Oscar nomination for best direction , is the dramatic story of a woman in turn-of-the-century New Zealand . &quot; The Piano &quot; is also a contender for the Oscar for best picture and the writers guild award comes_on top of many critics ' association prizes for Campion and leading actress Holly Hunter . * On Saturday night , the American Cinema Editors gathered at the Regent Beverly Wilshire for dinner ceremonies at which veteran film editor Michael Kahn won the &quot; Eddie Award &quot; for best edited motion_picture of 1993 for &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Unlike most film awards programs , the American Cinema Editors banquet remains largely a low-key event with the few TV cameras confined to the entrance . And despite the presence of several major celebrities , including a reunited Don Johnson and Melanie Griffin , there was only a handful of fans . Warren Beatty , who thanked the group for keeping the show low-key , presented the career achievement award to Dede Allen , who edited his &quot; Reds &quot; and one of his more celebrated starring vehicles , &quot; Bonnie and Clyde. &quot; Allen was at_home ill . Later the same evening , actress Ann Blyth presented a career achievement award to Gene Ruggiero , who began at MGM in the 1920s under then-chairman Nicholas Schenck and whose editing included films such_as &quot; Ninotchka , &quot; &quot; Oklahoma ! &quot; and &quot; Around the World in 80 Days. &quot; Complete lists of winners follow : Writers Guild Awards Screen Original screenplay : Jane Campion , &quot; The Piano. &quot; Screenplay adaptation : Steven Zaillian , &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Television Original longform : Jane Anderson , &quot; The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader Murdering Mom , &quot; HBO .
