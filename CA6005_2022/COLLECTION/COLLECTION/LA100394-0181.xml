   <HEADLINE> HEFNER ' DELIGHTED ' BY PLAYBOY JAZZ FILM FEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An artistic success and a commercial uncertainty . that ' s the best description of last week ' s Playboy Jazz Film Festival . * There was no denying the high_quality of the material in each of the festival ' s 17 screenings at the Laemmle ' s Sunset-5 theaters in West Hollywood . But the overflow audiences that arrived for the three primary evening events did not show_up for some of the other films . Nevertheless , Playboy ' s Hugh Hefner was far from disappointed with the results . &quot; I ' m just delighted with the way it worked_out , &quot; he said . &quot; It really turned_out to be something much larger than I originally expected it to be . And the reaction -- especially after the opening_night performance of ' One Day in Harlem ' -- was overwhelming. &quot; Hefner was &quot; touched personally &quot; by three of the films : &quot; Bix : Ain ' t None of Them Played Like Him Yet , &quot; &quot; Lady_Day : The Many Faces of Billie Holiday , &quot; and &quot; Too_Much Harmony &quot; ( a 1933 theatrical featuring Bing Crosby ) . &quot; There was something wonderful about the fact that so many other people also seemed to be moved by these films , &quot; he said . &quot; And the Crosby picture , in its restored version , was like seeing an entirely new film. &quot; Hefner , who attended all three days of the festival , was so impressed that he now plans to consider the restoration of more musicals -- perhaps starting with &quot; New Orleans , &quot; which also was included in the screenings . He is also &quot; taking a hard look &quot; at the potential for further installments . The original motivation for the film festival was the celebration of Playboy ' s 40th anniversary . But the Playboy Jazz_Festival was initially created to commemorate the magazine ' s 25th birthday , and soon became a major annual event at the Hollywood Bowl . The chance for a similar continuation of the Jazz Film Festival -- a possibility much hoped for by many attendees -- seems bright . Hefner also is considering packaging comparable jazz film compilations for tours to universities and colleges around the country . &quot; Film is , by definition , a more intimate medium than jazz performance , &quot; Hefner said . &quot; And there is something special about experiencing the music in such a direct way . I think we can do that with a college tour . Because if there was anything that was really moving about presenting these jazz films , it was the opportunity to give older people the chance to remember , and younger people the chance to discover. &quot; Producer Mark Cantor , who has one of the most extensive jazz film collections in the world , would like to see future festivals maintain the mainstream orientation of this year ' s &quot; Bix to Bird &quot; framework , while diversifying with other jazz items , as well . &quot; I ' d also like to see more peripheral programs such_as jazz dance and Western swing , &quot; Cantor said . &quot; We ' ve also talked_about possibly doing some kind of judging process for new_jazz films that have been made during the previous year . There are so many options. &quot; If nothing else , the Playboy Jazz Film Festival opened the doorway to a collection of jazz images largely unknown , even to the music ' s most avid fans . And there is much more available . Cantor , who regularly has produced programs of short jazz film_clips on_his_own as well as for the Playboy Jazz_Festivals , says there is sufficient material for dozens of different shows . Later this month , at KLON ' s Jazz West Celebration , for example , he will present three screenings encompassing Central Avenue music and a mix of Stan Kenton , Woody Herman and West Coast jazz . that ' s good news for the Playboy Jazz Film Festival ' s enthusiastic audiences . An eclectic assemblage of old and young , the crowds included fans mature enough to have seen Charlie Parker in_person , as well as listeners who might have seemed more appropriate for a Pearl Jam concert . The festival ' s success , despite its commercial shortcomings , may have been_best illustrated by one young_man who , emerging from the opening_night program in baggy shorts and a reversed baseball_cap , announced to his girlfriend , &quot; Wow , that guy Lester Young , man . He is way cool. &quot;</TEXT>
