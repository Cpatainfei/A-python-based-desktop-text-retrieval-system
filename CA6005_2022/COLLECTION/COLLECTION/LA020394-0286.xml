   <HEADLINE> S . AFRICA CAMPAIGN BUSTS WIDE OPEN ; POLITICS : NELSON MANDELA AND SUPPORTERS RALLY TO CELEBRATE FREEDOM . PRESIDENT DE KLERK ' S PARTY TAKES CREDIT FOR IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The campaign for this nation ' s future , largely a political fight over who gets the credit for ending the bitter apartheid past , erupted into a free-for-all Wednesday , the fourth anniversary of the day President Frederik W . de Klerk legalized Nelson Mandela ' s African National Congress and 35 other opposition groups . Here in the Western Cape wine country , Mandela and scores of other former political_prisoners sought to grab the moral high ground by lighting a &quot; torch of freedom , &quot; releasing doves and laying a wreath of white flowers on coils of razor wire outside Victor Verster prison , where Mandela served the last 14 months of his 27 years in harsh incarceration . &quot; You have no imagination of the cruelties that are committed behind those walls , &quot; Mandela told a sun-splashed rally of chanting , singing supporters at a jammed sports stadium in Paarl , north of Cape_Town . Two men wearing prison chains and manacles stood mutely in front of the stage under a huge banner that proclaimed &quot; Never Again ! &quot; The solemn scene took_on a festive air , however , when the former inmates , many now balding and bulging , paraded and danced around the dusty track under college-like banners marking their alma_maters : &quot; Death Row , &quot; &quot; Pretoria Central , &quot; &quot; Robben Island &quot; and other notorious political prisons of the apartheid years . The audience was in no mood for anything more formal . They surged into a block of seats reserved for dignitaries and cheerfully ignored an announcer who vainly appealed through a microphone , &quot; Please comrades , a revolutionary call is made on you to leave that area. &quot; Meantime , formality was the order of the night at the National Party congress at the World Trade Center in Kempton Park , outside Johannesburg . There , De Klerk launched his party ' s campaign by seeking -- uncomfortably -- to infuse several thousand of his button-down followers with a little bit of political soul . After leading several still-born chants and cheers , a black minister tried to lead the mostly white audience in three verses of &quot; Nkosi Sikeleli i ' Afrika , &quot; or &quot; God Bless Africa , &quot; the haunting call-and-response Xhosa hymn that the ANC has used for years as a liberation anthem . It is sung with passion at the start of every ANC rally , with the audience holding clenched fists aloft and singing in unison . But the National Party ' s all-white , six-man band in ill-fitting tuxedos mangled the tune . And after a_few tries , most delegates gave_up and silently followed the unfamiliar lyrics distributed on sheets_of_paper and shown on giant video screens at the front of the hall . De Klerk used his speech to claim credit for the liberation of the past and to issue a fervent call to arms against the ANC . &quot; The ANC would cast us back into the Dark Ages , &quot; he warned , as the crowd politely waved tiny flags . &quot; It is a party secretly controlled by Communists , militants and extremists. &quot; The ANC , he said , &quot; lusts for power and . . . is paying no more_than lip_service to the rights of minorities. &quot; Its only political experience , he added , &quot; has been in the politics of protest and destruction. &quot; For voters who missed the two events , the parties also faced_off in the nation ' s newspapers . The National Party took_out full-page ads in papers across the country . The ads not only claimed credit for the end of apartheid but tried to hijack Mandela ' s prison ceremony as well . &quot; Today Mr. Nelson Mandela honors President de Klerk with a ' Flame of Freedom , ' &quot; the ads read in bold type . The fine print said De Klerk had &quot; announced the death of apartheid and set South_Africa on_the_road to democracy , &quot; including releasing political_prisoners , abolishing apartheid laws , negotiating a new constitution and setting the stage for elections . In most papers , the ANC fired back with a two-page ad that was equally audacious . A huge cartoon showed Mandela as a boxer , with a fallen figure marked &quot; apartheid &quot; at his feet . Outside the ring , De Klerk , wearing a white jacket and bow_tie , clasped his own hands overhead in triumph , saying : &quot; I did_it ! I did_it ! &quot; Beneath the cartoon , the ad warned that &quot; the so-called ' new National Party ' is looking remarkably similar to the old one . In their latest version of history , they are the heroes that changed South_Africa . According to them , the people of this country played no part in ending apartheid oppression . . . . Next thing they ' ll be telling us apartheid never existed. &quot; Behind the skirmishing was a day of rich political symbolism and ironies . But it also showed how the two parties have already identified the voters they need and the issues they hope to exploit in the run-up to the country ' s first democratic elections . The voting will take_place over three days ; after two recent changes , it is now scheduled for April 26-28 . Despite published reports , no separate ballot is planned or likely for right-wing whites who have threatened repeatedly to launch a campaign of violence unless given the right to create a self-ruled white homeland . Less clear , however , is whether the ANC will give_in this week to growing demands by members of the Freedom Alliance , a coalition of black_and_white conservative leaders , for voters to be given two ballots instead of one . Under the interim constitution , voters will mark only one ballot to show their party preference for both the national and provincial assemblies . The Freedom Alliance , which includes Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party , has insisted that it will boycott the elections unless voters can split the ticket and choose different parties for the different assemblies . The ANC has argued that two ballots might be too confusing for illiterate voters and would lead to spoiled ballots . But a growing number of business_leaders , non-governmental groups and Western diplomats have urged the ANC to reconsider , saying multiple ballots have been used in several emerging democracies without ill effect .</TEXT>
