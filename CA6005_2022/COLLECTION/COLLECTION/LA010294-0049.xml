   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : THE ODD COUPLING ; GRUMPY GEEZERS VS . CANTANKEROUS COOTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Movies whose stories focus_on senior_citizens are rare -- so it seems doubly shocking that Warner Bros . decided to release two of them within a week of each other during the highly competitive Christmas season . And not just any two films about the Social_Security set : Both &quot; Wrestling Ernest Hemingway &quot; ( which opened in limited release on Dec . 17 , to go wider in January ) and &quot; Grumpy Old_Men &quot; ( opened wide on Christmas ) center_on a pair of older_men working_out issues of friendship , aging and loneliness . Both feature Oscar winners and nominees in their casts : Robert Duvall and Richard Harris in &quot; Wrestling &quot; ; Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in &quot; Grumpy. &quot; Both &quot; Grumpy , &quot; which is_on 1 # 200 screens , and &quot; Wrestling , &quot; which is_on only three , averaged more_than $ 3 # 000 per screen . What gives ? Warner Bros. ' marketing executives declined to be interviewed for this story . But the films ' directors have a_few ideas -- and neither seems upset about the timing . &quot; They saw them as two completely different movies , &quot; says Randa Haines , who directed &quot; Wrestling. &quot; &quot; They really have nothing in common in terms of story. &quot; Donald Petrie , director of &quot; Grumpy Old_Men , &quot; says : &quot; Frankly , I was nervous . But Warner Bros . convinced me that they would get very different releases . They ' re saying , ' Here ' s a Christmas movie with a wide release and here ' s another , more dramatic , more substantial film with a more limited release that will break bigger in January or February at Oscar time. ' &quot; Haines consciously made a film that treated the elderly in a manner that broke_with recent film conventions : &quot; So often , you see older people used as an easy joke , as though they ' ve crossed a boundary and become a different kind of human_being . that ' s not true . We don ' t talk_down to or make_fun of these people. &quot; The surprise , Petrie says , is not that both films are coming_out at_the_same_time but that both films got made at all . &quot; I was afraid that , because they were making hers , they would scrap ' Grumpy Old_Men , ' &quot; Petrie admits . &quot; I don ' t know , if I was a studio head , if I ' d take the risk . ( But ) from a demographic and marketing point_of_view , statistically , the over-50 set doesn ' t go_to the movies . Films targeted at an older audience are a harder sell. &quot; Observes Haines : &quot; Maybe it ' s a good sign that they don ' t think they can only make one old-person movie , the way they say , ' We can only have one woman ' s movie. ' There ' s always an appetite for a movie like this , that people tell each other about. &quot; &quot; I think what the studio hopes , &quot; Petrie says , &quot; is that people will say , ' Hey , I liked ' Wrestling Ernest Hemingway ' ; let ' s go see ' Grumpy Old Men. ' They hope the films will complement each other -- rather than cancel each other out. &quot;</TEXT>
