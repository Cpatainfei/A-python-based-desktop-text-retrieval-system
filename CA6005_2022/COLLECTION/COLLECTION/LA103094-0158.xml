   <HEADLINE> NORWAY IS FEARSOME WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING ITS RIGHTS OF THE SEA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They have shelled fishing trawlers , seized the ships of anti-whaling activists , wrangled with oil_companies , even faced down giant Russia . When it comes_to protecting their ocean , the easygoing , diplomatic Norwegians can be Vikings . Norwegians award the Nobel Peace Prize , sent mediators to the former Yugoslavia and brokered peace between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization . They also live from the sea and fiercely protect their rights to it . To Norway , the sea means jobs , military security , recreation and half of all exports , mainly oil , fish and shipping . Norwegians guard their patch of it zealously , as everyone from Russian submariners to trawler captains have discovered . &quot; We love peace , but we have to protect our rights , &quot; Ingvard Havnen , spokesman for the Foreign Ministry , explained after a summer of conflict . This nation of 4.3 million people claims nearly 800 # 000 square_miles of water , an area more_than six times its own size and about one-quarter the size of the United States . &quot; Life all along our coast has always depended_on the sea , &quot; said William Engseth , chairman of the industry committee in Parliament . &quot; Without it , we have no resources to live on. &quot; Much of cold and rocky Norway is north of the Arctic_Circle and only about 5 % of its area is farmed . But the sea is rich . Because of its North_Sea oil fields , Norway is Western Europe ' s largest oil exporter . It is a major exporter of fish and has one of the world ' s largest merchant fleets -- more_than 1 # 000 ships . &quot; The Norwegian economy has three legs : fish , shipping and offshore oil , &quot; said Willy Ostreng , director of the private Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo . &quot; And with such a long coastline , the ocean has always been a major security consideration. &quot; Norway , a member of NATO , constantly patrols its waters for possible intruders . Among those have been submarines from Russia ' s huge North Fleet , which use the waters off Norway as a corridor to the Atlantic . Such possessiveness often leads to conflict , and the Norwegians don ' t always win . This summer , oil_companies grew tired_of Norway ' s stiff taxes and demands for at least half of all oil produced . They threatened to slow , or even halt , development of new fields . With oil_production in current fields expected to dwindle after the year 2000 , Norway took the threat to heart . Jens Stoltenberg , minister of industry and energy , promised to review the rules . Norway was less understanding about whale-hunting , resuming its commercial hunt of minke_whales in 1993 and setting_off what newspapers called a &quot; whale war &quot; with environmentalists . In resuming the hunt after six years , the government exercised its right as a member of the International Whaling Commission to reject the commission ' s 1986 ban on commercial hunting . Norwegian commercial whalers killed 206 minkes last summer . When environmentalists sailed in , determined to stop the hunt , the coast guard was waiting . A ship operated by the militant Sea Shepherd group rammed a coast guard cutter in June , but got_away . In July , the coast guard boarded and seized two Greenpeace ships . Norwegian authorities stood their ground and the whale hunt was completed , but no sooner had the whalers returned to shore than a &quot; cod war &quot; began with Iceland . The Icelanders , desperate for fish to replace their own depleted stocks , in August sent an armada of fishing trawlers to disputed waters inside the 200-mile commercial zone Norway declared around its Arctic Svalbard Archipelago . Norway responded with gunboats . The coast guard fired on an Icelandic trawler , claiming one of its crewmen fired first . No one was injured . The trawler was boarded and sailed to shore with two holes in its stern .</TEXT>
