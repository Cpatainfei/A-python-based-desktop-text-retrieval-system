   <HEADLINE> LATIN_AMERICA ; CHILE ' S POLITICAL PRISONERS PUT AYLWIN ON SPOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Free the freedom-fighters , the left demands . Don ' t turn the terrorists loose , the right protests . President Patricio Aylwin is caught in the middle . Nearing the end of his four-year term , Aylwin faces some of his hardest decisions yet on the tough issue of what to do with &quot; subversives &quot; convicted for violent crimes under the former dictatorship of Gen . Augusto Pinochet . When Aylwin took_office in March , 1990 , almost 400 Chileans were in jail for politically motivated offenses under the Pinochet regime . Presidential pardons and commuted sentences have helped whittle that number down to 11 . But some of the last cases are the most controversial . In his latest act of leniency , just before Christmas , Aylwin freed a Communist guerrilla who had been sentenced to 35 years in prison by a military_court for a 1986 robbery-ambush in which a member of Chile ' s Carabineros police_force was killed . Aylwin , acting with his legal authority , commuted the sentence to exile in Belgium . &quot; As if Carabineros did not have a right_to_life and to justice , &quot; protested the policeman ' s mother . Such protests have reverberated loudly in the Chilean news media . &quot; One of the most criticized aspects of the current government ' s performance has been its policy on pardons , &quot; said an editorial Wednesday in the conservative daily newspaper El Mercurio . In all , Aylwin has commuted the sentences of 18 leftists convicted of violent political crimes , exiling them to Europe . More_than 150 other political_prisoners have received pardons and are free in Chile . Perhaps the most controversial pending requests for pardons are those of three men serving life sentences for an attempt to assassinate Pinochet in 1986 . He escaped , but five of his bodyguards were killed . Pro-Pinochet Sen . Eugenio Cantuarias has warned that pardons for those prisoners would &quot; necessarily affect &quot; the &quot; climate of trust that should exist between the armed forces and civilians. &quot; Although Pinochet gave_up government power in 1990 , he remains commander of the army . Those who favor release of all political_prisoners argue that most of them already have served long terms and that many did not receive fair trials in military_courts . They say the pardons contribute to peace and reconciliation in a country that was violently divided . Leftists claim that violence used to resist the dictatorship was legitimate . Former rebel Belinda Zubicueta , pardoned in October , declared that she had been &quot; unjustly jailed all these years for exercising my legitimate right to rebellion against a dictatorship that imposed state terrorism in our country. &quot; Chile ' s private Commission for the Defense of the People , which provides legal aid to political_prisoners , does not condone acts of terrorism but pushes for pardons on the grounds that the 16-year military regime was a period of serious human_rights violations , arbitrary rule and abnormal judicial processes . It is difficult for Aylwin to ignore that kind of reasoning when it comes from political allies such_as the Socialist_Party , which was brutally persecuted early in the military regime and now shares power with the president ' s Christian Democratic Party . But critics argue that crimes in which blood was shed should not be &quot; rewarded &quot; with leniency . Aylwin ' s justice minister said last week that the president will not leave any of the pending requests for pardons unresolved when he hands_over power in March to his elected successor , Eduardo Frei . Even if Frei is spared having to deal with those requests , however , others are expected to arise . Dozens of the former regime ' s political_prisoners who now are free on recognizance still have charges pending against them , as do many rebels who fled military rule and now plan to return . If they are convicted , Frei will face the issue of whether to pardon them . Leaders ' Lingering Problem The question of what to do with political_prisoners is a prickly matter that spans three changes of the nation ' s leadership . Gen . Augusto Pinochet Nearly 400 Chileans were in jail for &quot; subversion &quot; when former dictator stepped_down in 1990 . Three had tried to assassinate him . President Patricio Aylwin Aylwin has pardoned most political_prisoners or commuted their sentences . But 11 controversial cases remain unresolved . Eduardo Frei President-elect takes_office in March . Aylwin has vowed to resolve all requests for pardons by then . But others may arise .</TEXT>
