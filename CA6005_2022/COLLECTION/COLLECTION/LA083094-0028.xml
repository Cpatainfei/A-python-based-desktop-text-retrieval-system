Zvereva is not playing singles because she has a stress_fracture of a rib and wants to save herself for the doubles attempt . &quot; I ' ve been saying all along , that Natasha ( Zvereva ) at 70 % is better for me than any other doubles player in the world , &quot; Fernandez said . Also winning women ' s matches were Leila Meskhi of the Republic of Georgia , who stunned the tennis world by ousting Jennifer Capriati in the first round here last year , and former Pepperdine star Ginger Helgeson , who defeated Karin Kschwendt of Luxembourg , 6-2 , 6-1 .
