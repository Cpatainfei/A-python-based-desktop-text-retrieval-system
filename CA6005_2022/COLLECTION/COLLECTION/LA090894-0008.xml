   <TEXT> Patricia Freeman ' s musings ( Commentary , Sept . 2 ) about the annual return to school capture the sense of adventure and discovery that many teachers feel.The excitement of the start of a new school_year is not the exclusive domain of students . That excitement is part of what has drawn me to my classroom three times in the past week , even though school doesn ' t start until today . Despite all_the negative political , social , and economic threats that surround public education today , the basic unit of education -- kids and their teacher -- is alive and well , and it will continue to be our society ' s best hope for the future .
