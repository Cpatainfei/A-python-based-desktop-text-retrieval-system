   <HEADLINE> BRETTON WOODS : THE ECONOMIC EQUIVALENT TO D-DAY INVASION ; WORLD TRADE : CONFERENCE ' S POLICIES LED TO POST-WAR PROSPERITY . BUT ARE CHANGES NEEDED ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fifty years ago this month , representatives of 44 nations gathered_in the northern New Hampshire town of Bretton Woods , against the backdrop of the green slopes of Mt . Washington . There , far from the battlefields of World_War_II , they designed a massive , unprecedented reconstruction of the world ' s shattered economy . Half a century later , the legacy of that conference is an integral part of the global economic landscape . From households in Anaheim to conglomerates in Zurich , the world is still reaping major rewards of Bretton Woods . From that small_town in New Hampshire sprang the World_Bank and the International Monetary Fund . Of even more overarching importance , Bretton Woods gave_birth to a philosophy of openness in world commerce that remains the holy_grail of international economics . &quot; It spawned a world in which economic liberalism has become the dominant philosophy , &quot; said C . Fred Bergsten , a senior Treasury official in the Carter_Administration and now the director of the Institute for International Economics . &quot; Economic prosperity has been unprecedented . Economic stability has been unprecedented . There ' s been no major collapse . It has underpinned global peace. &quot; Yet even as they salute the lasting accomplishments of the coordinating_system conceived at Bretton Woods , an elite group of central bankers , corporate_executives and financiers from around the world has raised a fundamental question for global leaders to ponder : Is it time to do_it all_over again ? After a decade of financial market gyrations that recently propelled the U.S. dollar to new post-war lows , there is a move afoot to craft a sweeping reform plan that would revitalize some of the central ideas and institutions of the original Bretton Woods accord . While the proposal elicits a skeptical response from government policy-makers in Washington , Bonn and Tokyo , it has provoked a flurry of debate among global financial experts . Amid the 50th anniversary hubbub surrounding D-Day and other events , the anniversary of Bretton Woods has drawn little notice outside the tightly_knit world of international economists . Yet in its own way , it is just as important . As Bretton Woods participants gathered_in July , 1944 , allied troops were pressing through northern France toward Paris . In the South Pacific , U.S forces were routing the Japanese from their island strongholds . Those battles , and the economic precursors to the war , were the backdrop for the deliberations at the Mt . Washington Hotel . The site was chosen because , unlike some New England resorts , it would provide a room to U.S. Treasury_Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. , who was Jewish . Woven throughout the conference were the lessons learned from World_War I and the troubled years between the two global conflicts . It was an era of political weakness , protectionism , hyperinflation and depression . If the post-war world was to prosper , the participants recognized , it would have to learn from the economic failures that fueled the war that was still raging . Put simply , it would have to conduct its future business -- from broad monetary policy to country-by-country trade -- in a much more open , but orderly , fashion . The philosophical descendants of the Bretton Woods economists -- the participants included John Maynard Keynes -- say the openness has been the conference ' s enduring legacy . Yet the anniversary observation has also led to a critical examination of the structures set_up at Bretton Woods , the coordinating_system it put into place , and their lasting impact on world affairs . Increasingly sharp criticism has been aimed at the International Monetary Fund and the World_Bank for what some observers regard_as extravagant spending on staff travel and perquisites . At the same time , the twin institutions have been accused of having little to show for their efforts to underwrite development projects in Africa and Latin_America despite 50 years of staggering economic_growth in Europe , the United States and , more recently , Asia . Another primary objective of the original Bretton Woods accord has been abandoned altogether . Strict control of currency exchange_rates was abandoned in 1971 , replaced by a system of floating exchange_rates . Although the shift provided the United States and other leading nations more flexibility to pursue domestic economic priorities , it introduced the volatility that has periodically shaken the international monetary community . Two major changes in the world financial structure were recently recommended by the independent Bretton Woods Commission , chaired by former Federal_Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and made_up of corporate officials , former government officials , academics and bankers from the United States , Germany , Japan and 15 other nations . In a report , the panel recommended that major industrial nations strengthen their fiscal and monetary policies to achieve greater harmony , and do a better job of coordinating their activities in_order to avoid exchange_rate volatility . A failure to deal with the problems caused by skewed or wildly fluctuating exchange_rates can create uncertainty that chokes_off the international investments , the report warned . That , in turn , could lead to &quot; protectionist pressures from vulnerable industries in one major country after another as their international competitiveness waxes and wanes &quot; with changing currency values . Whether the study will have any lasting impact is debatable . Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , speaking_to a group of conference participants who were considering the recommendations , was nonplussed , saying that quiet cooperation and consultation between governments are preferable to a radical restructuring . Among other global economic leaders , most notably those from Japan and Germany , there was no evident enthusiasm for the Volcker proposals . Other criticisms have come from a group called Fifty Years is Enough . The coalition of 82 environmental , religious and labor groups , among others , wants to pressure the World_Bank to give greater weight to the social and environmental impact of its lending policies . Under the accepted rules of the World_Bank and International Monetary Fund , new borrowers must attempt to bring_down trade_barriers , develop sophisticated markets , reduce labor costs and remove subsidies that offer domestic industries unfair trade advantages . &quot; We ' re polarizing these countries ' economies and politics , and that is going_to come_back to hurt the international community , &quot; said Doug Hellinger , managing director of the Development Group for Alternative Policies , one of the founding members of the &quot; Fifty Years is Enough &quot; campaign . In its broadest sense , Bretton Woods spawned a largely free-flowing system of global trade and investment . What was in 1944 a relative trickle of cross-border commerce -- less than $ 1 billion a day -- has become a financial torrent estimated at more_than $ 1 trillion . &quot; If we didn ' t have an open trading system , Americans would have gotten VCRs 10 years later , and they would n ' t now be getting_to rent videos , &quot; said Lawrence H . Summers , undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs . &quot; If we didn ' t have an open trading system we ' d still be driving gas-guzzling cars . If we didn ' t have an open trading system , we ' d still be producing steel in large-firing plants where people went deaf . If we didn ' t have an open trading system , clothing would cost twice as much as it does. &quot; According to Summers , the spirit of Bretton Woods produced a more dynamic world economy . &quot; It spurred a good_deal of the innovation that took_place in this country , and it gave us access to a whole set of things at lower cost than we otherwise would have had access to , &quot; he said . &quot; And all_of that translated into higher real income &quot; for most Americans . The economic_system put_in place by Bretton Woods may have also played a key role in preventing a third global conflict . &quot; The most important thing that happened after World_War_II is there wasn ' t a World_War III . The reason there wasn ' t a World_War III is in no small part because a network of economic interconnections was created , and capitalism succeeded , &quot; Summers said . &quot; We won the Cold_War because we in the West prospered together , and we prospered together because we integrated our economies. &quot; In addition , &quot; economic thinking was homogenized in the way that McDonald ' s has homogenized our taste , &quot; said Antoine van Agtmael , president of Emerging Markets Management , a firm that invests in developing countries . &quot; It is overlooked , but it is incredibly important. &quot;</TEXT>
