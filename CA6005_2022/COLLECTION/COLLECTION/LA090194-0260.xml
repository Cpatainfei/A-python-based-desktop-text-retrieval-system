   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; FRUSTRATION , WAR-WEARINESS LED TO IRA MOVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Within a_few hours of the_Irish Republican Army ' s cease-fire announcement Wednesday , the leader of the group ' s political arm was extolling the sacrifice and dedication of those who had fought to end British rule_in Northern_Ireland . &quot; This is a generation of men and women who ' ve fought the_British for 25 years and have not been defeated by them , &quot; Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams told a group of cheering supporters in the party ' s Northern_Ireland stronghold of West Belfast . While Adams is certainly correct that neither the presence of 18 # 000 British soldiers nor one of the best-trained , best-armed civilian police_forces anywhere could crush the IRA ' s capacity to kill , the whole truth is more complicated . Indeed , for many of those most familiar_with the rhythm of violence that has been a part of Northern_Ireland for the last quarter-century , it was the IRA ' s sober assessment that it had failed to make any real headway toward its goal of wresting Ulster from British rule_in its long campaign that played a key role in Wednesday ' s decision to give_up its armed struggle . There was also a very personal motivation on the part of IRA activists to halt their campaign : While many key figures in the guerrilla army first became active when they were teen-agers , the ensuing 25 years had seen them become fathers of children who are themselves now at an age to become involved in the bloody struggle . According to those close to the republican movement , few of the hard-core activists wanted their children to lead similar lives . This war-weariness is reflected , analysts say , in the fact that it was Sinn Fein , not the_British government , that initiated the back-channel contacts that first began between them early last year . Some analysts also argue it is significant that the cease-fire reserved no right of reprisal to possible Protestant extremist attacks and that Adams has asked_for no amnesty for the estimated 400 republican prisoners in British and Ulster jails . Instead , his demand has been that those prisoners in Britain be returned to Northern_Ireland . Other factors besides IRA weariness also played a role . Among them : * Over a period_of_time , activist members of Ulster ' s Roman_Catholic , Irish nationalist minority gradually came_to realize that a lasting peace settlement could be achieved only with the consent of the Protestant majority . John Hume , leader of moderate nationalist opinion , was the first adherent of this belief -- which gradually spread through the senior ranks of the_Irish government in Dublin and eventually seeped into the thinking of the IRA ' s political wing , Sinn Fein . Adams , who has met with Hume often in recent months , is now willing to take_part in talks that would lead to a settlement acceptable to all strands of Northern_Ireland society . ( Hume on Wednesday was among the most vigorous in insisting that the IRA cease-fire is a permanent one . &quot; I see the statement as a complete cessation of violence , &quot; he said . &quot; Complete means complete. &quot; ) At the same time , moderate Protestant leaders realized that the political constituency represented by Sinn Fein had to be recognized and , therefore , included in any settlement . As positions narrowed , the only real prerequisite to sit at a peace table became an unequivocal renunciation of violence . * For British Prime_Minister John Major , the time was also ripe ; going_for an Ulster settlement by stating his willingness to sit_down with Sinn Fein certainly is a political gamble for him but one that has become increasingly attractive . Major ' s personal image and his party ' s popularity are both near all-time lows . Playing the pivotal role in bringing peace to Northern_Ireland would give his stock a major boost . Failure could hardly send it lower . While the absence of the word permanent to describe the cease-fire in the IRA statement and the debate surrounding its absence is a setback to Major , he brushed_aside questions in a television interview . &quot; What concerns me is ending bloodshed on the streets of Northern_Ireland after 25 years that has too often spilled_over into the ( British ) mainland as well , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s time to end that and begin a new future. &quot; * The attitude of a new Democratic Administration in Washington is also believed to have been a factor . The Clinton_Administration was interested in_playing a low-key role to nudge the talks forward and gained credibility as a mediator within the IRA by allowing senior republican figures to travel_to the United States . Trips by Adams earlier this year and by well-known IRA activists Joseph Cahill and Pat Treanor this week are believed to have boosted the IRA resolve to go_forward with the cease-fire . In each of these instances , President Clinton reportedly personally approved the decision to grant the visa . While these circumstances have opened the door to the real possibility of peace for the first time in a quarter of a century in Northern_Ireland , the road to a final settlement remains littered with far more questions than answers .</TEXT>
