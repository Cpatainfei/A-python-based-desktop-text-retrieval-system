   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL AND JORDAN AGREE TO JOINT ' WARM PEACE ' PROJECTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel and Jordan , consolidating what President Clinton called a &quot; warm peace &quot; between former enemies , announced on Monday joint economic and environmental projects intended to give their citizens a tangible dividend from the end of 46 years of hostility . Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Jordan ' s Crown_Prince Hassan completed work_on the measures in a meeting at the White_House with Clinton and other U.S. officials . &quot; If we succeed in our endeavors , and I do believe we shall , it will serve as a model for many other places , &quot; Peres told reporters with Hassan and Clinton at his side . &quot; We are going_to take_parts of the desert and convert it into valleys of peace , of agriculture , of tourism. &quot; The new projects , under_consideration since Israel and Jordan ended their formal state_of_war in July , are designed to speed the economic and commercial development of the Jordan Rift_Valley , a largely desert region centered_on the Dead_Sea and straddling the border between the two countries . Peres and Hassan also agreed to open a second border crossing in the north of the two countries , establish a free-trade zone between the southern cities of Eilat and Aqaba , create a Red_Sea Marine Peace Park and begin feasibility studies of dams on the Yarmuk and Jordan_rivers to alleviate the region ' s chronic water shortage . Clinton said the measures &quot; are solid evidence that Jordan and Israel have not only ended their state_of_war but are following_through on their commitment to cooperate with each other and negotiate as rapidly as possible a final peace_treaty . The steps we announce today are the building_blocks of a modern peace between these ancient lands. &quot; Israeli and Jordanian officials said they hope to complete negotiations on a formal peace_treaty by the year ' s end . Meantime , the two countries are creating a warmer relationship than exists between many states that have been at_peace for generations , they said . State_Department officials said Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher will visit the Middle_East starting this weekend to resume his shuttle mediation between Israel and Syria . In advance of that trip , Clinton plans to meet Friday at the White_House with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh . U.S. officials said Israel and Syria are inching toward a peace agreement , though officials of the two nations have not met face-to-face for months . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Syrian President Hafez Assad are communicating through American go-betweens . Before returning to Washington , Christopher plans to attend ceremonies marking the northern border crossing between Israel and Jordan . The first crossing between the two countries linking Eilat and Aqaba was opened in August . Until the completion of a final peace_treaty , the border is open only to citizens of third countries . In Jerusalem , Rabin predicted Israel and Jordan will complete a peace_treaty &quot; shortly , even before the end of the year. &quot; But in a speech to the opening session of the Israeli Parliament , Rabin said Israel and Syria are still far apart in their separate negotiations . He said the remaining issues in the Israel-Jordan talks are border demarcation , water and security .</TEXT>
