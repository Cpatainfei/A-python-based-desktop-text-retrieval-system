   <HEADLINE> PAINSTAKING EFFORTS EXPOSE STATE ' S LARGEST OIL SPILL ; POLLUTION : UNOCAL ADMITS PROBLEMS OVER 40-YEAR PERIOD . FIRM IS TAKING MORE EXTENSIVE CLEANUP MEASURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kathy Johannes remembers the winter of 1988 in vivid detail : Dozens of seals and sea_lions struggled ashore and suffered fatal seizures on the beaches of Central California . The animals all had an oily sheen , and beneath their fur she could see that their skin was inflamed . Soon , the volunteer animal rescue worker became convinced that the deaths were linked to frequent oily discharges from the Unocal Corp . oil field on the sand_dunes of Guadalupe . But the Los Angeles based-company denied that it had spilled any oil , and local authorities declined to take action . &quot; In 1988 we were telling them there was a problem and nobody listened , &quot; Johannes said . &quot; Nobody did anything about it. &quot; Now , thanks largely to a new state agency funded by a tax on oil_companies , Unocal ' s pollution problems at the Guadalupe field are no longer being ignored . Evidence painstakingly collected by the state Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response shows that for 15 years , some Unocal employees sought to cover_up what has become the largest petroleum spill in California history . State investigators found that as far back as 1978 , employees at the field were told not to call attention to repeated spills of diluent , a petroleum thinner used in large quantities to dilute Guadalupe ' s heavy crude_oil . When one diluent spill formed an oil_slick 4 1 / 2 miles long on the ocean in 1986 , Unocal remained silent . When questioned about another ocean spill in 1988 , the company produced laboratory tests incorrectly showing that Unocal was not to blame . Under state law , oil_companies must report any petroleum spill immediately . &quot; Unocal misstated the facts in a way that the government regulators were misled about the true nature of the pollution problem , &quot; said warden Allen N . Huckaby , the dogged investigator for the oil spill agency who helped break_open the case . Finally , Unocal acknowledged this month that it has leaked up_to 8.5 million gallons of the clear , diesel-like fluid into the ground in a series of discharges and pipeline breaks over 40 years . The company pleaded no contest last week to three misdemeanor pollution charges -- including failing to report ocean spills -- and was ordered to pay $ 1.5 million in penalties . Top Unocal officials , embarrassed by the revelations , insist that they were shocked to learn of the magnitude of the spill and disappointed by the failure of employees to notify authorities when leaks occurred . Executive_Vice_President John F . Imle Jr. , who personally entered the company ' s no contest plea in court , insisted that the firm ' s highest levels of management never ordered a cover-up . But he conceded that workers at the aging oil field , worried that pollution problems could shut_down the operation , may have kept the spills quiet to protect their jobs . Authorities uncovered no evidence that top officials of the company helped conceal the spills . &quot; I can assure you there was never an institutional cover-up , &quot; Imle said . &quot; Somewhere in the system , we dropped the ball . . . . We will review our own procedures to see where they broke down. &quot; Leased by Unocal since the early 1950s , the oil field is spread among the sand_dunes at the southern edge of San Luis Obispo County , a mile from the little town of Guadalupe . The beach , where the field ' s first wells were drilled , is the site of Unocal ' s greatest problems . Even on the best of days , the odor of diluent rises from the sand . Beneath the beach , diluent from numerous spills sits on top of the ground_water in an underground pool . On the worst of days -- usually during winter high_tides -- the ocean scours away the sand down to the water_table and washes the diluent into the ocean , where it poses a hazard to surfers and aquatic life . Some surfers say they have suffered rashes from exposure to the diluent . One group of surfers has notified Unocal that it intends to sue the company under Proposition 65 , which requires businesses to warn the public of exposure to cancer-causing chemicals . In addition to the marine mammals recovered by Johannes , wildlife experts question what kind of damage the leaks have done to marine creatures , particularly the Pismo clam , found four miles north at Pismo Beach . During the last decade , there have been years when the clams have produced virtually no offspring . Biologists have generally attributed the unusual reproductive pattern to ocean_currents and the voracious appetite of the sea_otter . But Unocal officials say they plan to study whether the spills could have been responsible . &quot; So far , we have seen no evidence to connect it , but it ' s not conclusive , &quot; said Marjorie Hatter , who was recently assigned by Unocal to head the cleanup effort . &quot; We have a lot more work to do. &quot; Farther inland under the oil field , test wells have found greater concentrations of diluent floating on top of ground_water . Altogether , there are 28 plumes of the fluid , with the largest concentration near tanks used to store and distribute the diluent for 35 years . If not for the repeated seepage of diluent into the ocean , the massive spill -- caused by broken pipelines , overflowing tanks and careless handling of the cheap and plentiful liquid -- might have gone unnoticed for many_more years . Spilled diluent usually soaked quickly into the sandy , porous ground without leaving visible signs . Ground_water beneath the oil field is not used for drinking , so the contamination did not surface in wells . But in the winter of 1990 , a major ocean spill forced the company to acknowledge that the petroleum was coming from its oil field . The company stopped using diluent , shut_down most oil_production at the field , installed wells on the beach to pump out the fluid and built a submerged seawall in an unsuccessful attempt to stop further ocean spills . But the company still did not acknowledge the full extent of the leaks at the field . It was not until 1993 -- after the oil spill agency had seized some of Unocal ' s records and ordered the company to drill a dozen test wells -- that the company admitted there was contamination throughout the oil field . &quot; Until then , I don ' t think anyone ( outside Unocal ) even had a remote indication there was this kind of a problem , &quot; said Stephen L . Sawyer , a lawyer with the Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response . &quot; The pattern of failing to report is the ( heart ) of the offense . If they had reported as required , all_the leaks throughout the field might not have occurred. &quot; The oil spill agency , which was created by the Legislature after the Huntington Beach oil spill of 1989 , is preparing to file a civil suit this week seeking penalties of as much as $ 170 million from Unocal . Now , with the end of the criminal case against the company , the Guadalupe oil field is being transformed into a cleanup site . In one part of the field , workers are drilling wells in a pilot_project to see how effectively they can recover diluent floating on the ground_water . Elsewhere , experts are taking carbon_dioxide measurements and sinking test probes to map_out the location of the contamination . Recognizing that its earlier beach cleanup efforts failed , Unocal is proposing to stop the ocean spills once and for all this spring by excavating the beach several feet down to the water_table , installing a wall farther inland to halt the migration of diluent , and replacing the beach with clean sand . Elsewhere in the oil field , the company proposes to drill wells to pump up the diluent , recovering about 30 % of what is there . Then they plan to rely_on bacteria to consume the rest of the product , pumping oxygen and moisture into the ground to accelerate the natural_process . The entire project could take_five years . Within the same period , Unocal plans to halt production and remove all traces of the wells above ground . Imle , who is a member of Unocal ' s board of directors , said he wished that employees had come_to him long ago with reports of the spill . Now , he says , the message has been delivered loud and clear that employees must comply with reporting laws . &quot; The standard today is , you spill a drop of diluent or anything else in that field and you tell somebody about it , &quot; he said . According to evidence compiled by the state oil spill agency , Imle ' s philosophy was not the rule from 1978 to 1993 . In a report filed last week with the San Luis Obispo district_attorney ' s office , Huckaby , the investigating agent , documented some of the efforts by Unocal employees to cover_up spills . In 1986 , an employee named John Smith suggested installing a pump to collect diluent that was floating on top of the ground_water in a shallow hole near the beach . His proposal was rejected by a foreman who told him : &quot; We don ' t want anybody to know we know this is here , &quot; according to Huckaby ' s report . Shortly afterward , the foreman ordered the hole filled_in . Smith later became a key figure in the case after he called the state agency anonymously in 1992 to report that Unocal was attempting to cover_up another major leak . His call led to a search_warrant and raid of Unocal offices in which agents seized numerous company records and began to unravel the cover-up . Another incident cited by Huckaby occurred in the winter of 1988 , when diluent entered the ocean in such quantities that residents of the area complained of oil pollution at Guadalupe Beach , just south of the oil field . Unocal took samples of the spilled oil and reported that it did not match diluent used at the field . The company suggested that the oil had come from a passing ship that discharged fuel . Charging that Unocal collected bogus samples , Huckaby wrote : &quot; It is clear Unocal lied to or deliberately misled ( local authorities ) concerning the oil contamination to the beach and surf. &quot; It was during the three months after this spill that Johannes , the animal rescue worker , recovered 72 dying or dead_sea lions and seals , according to her records . She said she also found dead marine mammals after spills in 1989 , 1990 and 1992 . Despite her repeated pleas , local authorities were unwilling to take_on Unocal in the face of the company ' s denials , she said . Finally , she became so frustrated she turned_in her federal permit for rescue work , saying she no longer wanted to be an accomplice to the oil_company ' s pollution . &quot; I was running_around picking_up animals for five years , &quot; Johannes said . &quot; I ' m very angry about it . They owe that money ( court penalties ) in a big way because they ignored the animals . They ' ve been covering this up for years. &quot; Record Spills The total volume of petroleum thinner spilled at the Guadalupe oil field ranks it as one of the largest oil spills in the nation .
