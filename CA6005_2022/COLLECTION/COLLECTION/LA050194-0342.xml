   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; SUDDEN DEATH ON THE STREETS ; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN HIT-AND-RUN CASES . THIS MOST RANDOM OF CRIMES LEAVES VICTIMS ' FAMILIES IN SHOCK AND POLICE FRUSTRATED BY ELUSIVE SUSPECTS AND CLUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the grounds of a majestic home_in Hancock Park , the traces of the epidemic are subtle . Patches of dirt stand_out as scabs in what had been a lovely corner garden . Littering the ground are shards of glass , an automobile headlight and , wrapped in cellophane , a wilting bouquet . A hit-and-run driver killed Marcy Lewis in a horrific flash right here . On a barren sidewalk in Harbor City , outlining a vacant corner lot claimed by weeds , votive candles burn for Porfiria Lopez . A hit-and-run driver struck her in the street , but most of her body came_to rest_on this corner , where a homemade shrine marks the grief of strangers and friends . Neither case has been solved . The women died within an hour of each other on the same March evening in a region where such deaths are routine : Southern California leads the nation in hit-and-run accidents -- fatal and otherwise . And Los Angeles by far leads the state . With its large population and dependence on the automobile , Los Angeles simply has more drivers on_the_road . It also has more who are likely to be involved in hit-and-runs : people who are driving without a license , without insurance or in an unregistered vehicle . When they hit something -- or someone -- their first impulse often is to flee . Police believe that this is particularly true of some illegal immigrants , whose fear of government officials outweighs what they might not understand as their obligation to stop . And , in_general , many hit-and-run drivers are drunk . The victims defy typecasting . All ages , races and classes have been struck -- in cars , on bicycles and on foot . And the fleeing driver often gets_away , stealing from victims ' families even the sad satisfaction of justice done . Still , survivors make pilgrimages to the site where their loved one fell , in search of information or , failing that , a sense of peace . &quot; All we want to do is get this murderer , &quot; Marcy Lewis ' mother-in-law , Pat Lewis , pleads to no one and everyone at once . She cannot look_at the garden , with its grisly reminders , for long . Police say the driver of a white ' 78 Chevy van raced through a stop sign at about 70 m.p.h. and crashed into the new Infiniti that was carrying Marcy Lewis and her husband , Simon , home to Sherman Oaks . Lewis , 27 , a Music Center publicist , never had a chance . Her husband of less than five months , an independent film_producer who at 36 is the youngest of the Lewis sons , is still hospitalized with a fragile hold_on life . The driver escaped by running_away . The van ' s last registered owner cannot be found . The Lewises , who immigrated to Los Angeles 17 years ago from London , are offering a reward for information leading to prosecution . Donations have pushed the total above $ 20 # 000 . Police say their suspect could have fled the country . More_than a month after the accident , they say they have nothing ; not even the crackpots have called with clues . &quot; It ' s the anonymity of what happened here , &quot; says Simon ' s brother Jonathan . &quot; For me , that is what makes_it so heinous . This person came_out of the blue and went_back into the blue . It ' s like a professional hit. &quot; &quot; They act like God , these people ! &quot; says his mother , near tears . * Last year , half of the 51 # 627 surface street accidents reported to the Los Angeles Police_Department were hit-and-runs . Such cases are among the most difficult to solve . There is no motive . Witnesses see different things in the blur of a passing vehicle , or the glow of taillights , or perhaps nothing at all . License_plates may have expired . Registration records can be a dead_end ; fictitious names can be used . Police say suspects often slip across the border into Mexico or beyond . Then another case comes_along . In Los Angeles , there are so many hit-and-runs that police routinely ignore less serious ones involving only property damage . If they investigated them all , they say , they would do nothing else . The department does not keep records on how many are solved , but a rough accounting from the commanders of LAPD ' s four traffic divisions shows that in about half of the fatal cases -- the ones given the most attention -- suspects are eventually found . The hit-and-run problem is exacerbated by what people in and outside the government describe as an insidious and deadly cycle in California . As legislators pass more laws to keep irresponsible drivers off the road , the truly irresponsible seem to flout them even more . Although some measures -- such_as automatic license suspensions for one drunk driving arrest -- are credited with saving thousands of lives , there is often fallout , too . For example , before an owner can register a vehicle , he must pay outstanding traffic or parking fines . So instead of coming clean , the owner -- especially a poor one -- may decide not to register the vehicle . Then , he cannot insure it . Even if he does register his vehicle , getting insurance after a drunk driving arrest is tough . An existing policy may be canceled or rates may skyrocket . The state_Department of Motor_Vehicles estimates that 150 # 000 convicted drunk drivers each year do not even try to get their licenses back -- or maintain an insurance_policy -- but drive nonetheless . Although no one knows how many regularly drive without a license , the DMV estimates the number at 10 % of the state ' s drivers , or about 2 million people . This includes many of the 41 # 815 Californians who had their licenses revoked last year , and the 1.2 million others whose licenses were suspended . The primary reasons were driving without insurance and driving while drunk . * Normandie Avenue in Harbor City is four lanes wide , bordered by housing projects , graffiti-scrawled walls , a church and a market where the homeboys like to hang . Cars heading down the_hill fly toward Pacific Coast Highway . Hardly anybody in the neighborhood knows that the speed_limit is 35 . Laws get broken here all_the time . On the same evening that the Lewises were driving through Hancock Park , Porfiria Lopez , 62 , and her neighbor , Esther Alvarado , were walking along Normandie toward their church , the Iglesia Apostolica de la Fe Cristo Jesus . They were right on_time to make the 6:30 service , with Bibles and hymn books in_hand . The women , friends for 14 years , crossed Normandie halfway and waited for the westbound traffic to pass . As they stood_in the street , Lopez remarked to Alvarado about one car that seemed to be traveling particularly fast . In the same instant , Alvarado heard a thud , turned_around , and screamed . Lopez ' s body was flying through the air , disintegrating from the impact of the speeding car . &quot; It was like a bullet that passed_by , &quot; Alvarado says . Even after the Fire_Department hosed_down the area , Lopez ' s relatives found bits of her flesh the next day . Her ankle and foot were recovered more_than a block away . Her blood stains the street still . The driver of the car that killed her -- a silver color , investigators believe -- never slowed_down . &quot; We have nothing , &quot; Los Angeles police Detective Bob Platt says . &quot; Sometimes I just go walk_around the neighborhood , hoping somebody will come_up_to me , tell me something that they saw that will lead me someplace. &quot; And Platt notes with irony that barring some gross vehicular violation -- such_as driving while drunk -- the driver might not have been charged with a criminal offense if he had stopped . He says Lopez may have contributed to her death by jaywalking -- although her relatives point_out that the closest crosswalk is blocks away . Fleeing the scene of an accident , however , is a crime . But like the vast majority of hit-and-run cases -- which usually draw little attention from the public and the media -- there is no reward offered for information in the death of Lopez , a mother of two and grandmother of 10 . Her family is left with only a faint hope that somebody will come_forward with information . Within hours after Lopez was killed , the small shrine was erected on the corner . The neighborhood people say it was the homeboys who built the cross . Lopez didn ' t like the gangs , but she was a friend to all . She and her family -- her husband , sister , nieces and nephews -- have lived_on these desolate blocks for nearly 30 years . &quot; Black people , white people , people of all different races have been bringing flowers and cards , &quot; says her nephew , Eddie Torres . &quot; They knew her as a nice lady . Everybody respected her . My homeboys would be doing something wrong , and my aunt would come_out and tell them to stop . And they would. &quot; Says her 64-year-old sister , Petra Lopez , through tears , &quot; We were like one person . We were always together . She was so accepting of her life . She was so good . She always saw the good in everybody else. &quot; Lopez ' s death tears at Detective Platt too . Like her relatives , he cannot erase the ignoble image of her body torn_into bits . But soon , he says , the case will likely go_into &quot; never-never land. &quot; &quot; It will always be open , but it ' s not going_to be solved without the citizens ' help , &quot; he says . &quot; And it depends_on whether the person who did this has a conscience . If it was a kid , a gangbanger type , that ' s doubtful . The average citizen would have stopped. &quot; If Platt does make an arrest in the case , he says , the likely charge would be felony hit-and-run , tacked_on to the original violation : misdemeanor manslaughter -- what traffic_cops describe as a &quot; ticket with a body. &quot; * Police and Highway Patrol officers say that if you work hit-and-runs long enough , you notice certain themes . Drivers most likely to be involved in such accidents feel they have something to lose by stopping , or they don ' t understand the laws of the United States . Detective Bill Whittacker , officer in_charge of the LAPD ' s South Traffic Division , says an internal audit of January arrests showed that 65 % of his division ' s felony traffic suspects were in the country illegally . He says the department was able to determine the suspects ' immigration status based on questions asked during booking . Dick Litsinger , the department ' s chief traffic detective in Central Division , says &quot; easily 75 % &quot; of felony traffic suspects in his area are undocumented immigrants . Estimates from traffic investigators in the LAPD ' s other two divisions are not quite as high . Illegal immigrants do not necessarily get involved in more accidents than other drivers , but officers believe that some are less likely to stop -- particularly those from places such_as Mexico and Central_America , where traffic laws can be onerous . Moreover , DMV officials worry that the new law requiring drivers to show proof of legal residency before they can be issued a driver ' s license may encourage more unskilled -- and unlicensed -- drivers . &quot; I think the fear factor is a big part in all this , &quot; says Sgt . Julio Nunez , assistant watch commander of the LAPD ' s South Traffic Division . &quot; Many of the individuals believe the laws are the same as where they came from . &quot; In Mexico , if you don ' t have insurance , or money for the hospital or repairs , they can arrest you and put you in jail . Secondly , because we wear a law_enforcement uniform , they think we are tied_in with immigration. &quot; Nunez has applied for a federal grant to fund a program he hopes will alleviate some of the problem by providing public_service announcements in Spanish , explaining traffic laws and warning of the dangers of driving while drunk . &quot; Because they have a fear of police and because they have a lack of understanding , there is a greater likelihood that Spanish-speaking individuals will be hit-and-run drivers , &quot; Nunez says . But other police and Highway Patrol officers say that education efforts , while laudable , are at best long-term . And they say even good detective_work becomes almost meaningless when suspects flee across the Mexican border . Gabriel Avila Vegahas evaded Anaheim police for nearly three years . They say his car jumped a curb and pinned 16-year-old Jose Viramontes against a house . Viramontes lost his left leg . He spent almost a year in the hospital and never was able to return to high_school . As early as the evening of the accident , police said they believed Avila was already in Mexico . &quot; I would like him to pay_for what he did , &quot; Viramontes says . &quot; But I don ' t think he ' s going_to come_back around here. &quot; Police in the San Fernando Valley tell a similar tale about Enrique Garcia Robles . They say he killed Gayle Gozar , 19 , when he ran a red_light and smashed his Chevy Blazer into a Nissan Sentra driven by Gozar ' s friend . &quot; It was a tank versus a tin_can , basically , &quot; says Detective Jim Mann , who investigated the case three years ago . &quot; We were about a second behind him the whole time , &quot; says Mann of the police efforts to track Garcia down . &quot; Then he crossed into Mexico and disappeared. &quot; * Despite long odds , investigators sometimes get lucky . Juan Ramon Martinez , 25 , has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of Kellie Rae Wilson , a single mother of a 4-year-old boy , as she rode her red bicycle in Azusa Canyon on a sunny afternoon in March . The state says Martinez ' s weapon was his car , a 1959 Dodge Royal . The officers involved in the case look_upon his arrest as a victory , a case of a big-time hit-and-run driver who did not get_away . Jim Duffy , a public_defender in Pomona , will not talk_about his client other_than to say that he is very remorseful . &quot; He wants the family to know that he wished it had never happened , &quot; Duffy says . Prosecutors and the Highway Patrol say Martinez hit Wilson as she was pedaling up a canyon hill on California 39 . The force of the impact shattered the windshield of Martinez ' s car , and threw Wilson down an embankment . Wilson died within an hour . She was 30 , a horticulturist and an assistant manager at a Santa Monica bike shop . Her leg was severed and the left side of her body was crushed . The driver never stopped , passing one of Wilson ' s friends a little farther down the road . In a sense , it was pure happenstance that put Martinez behind bars . He has pleaded not_guilty and , unable to make $ 1 million bail , awaits a preliminary hearing Tuesday . About 18 miles from the spot where Martinez allegedly hit Wilson , Los Angeles County sheriff ' s deputies crested a hill and saw his car in the opposing lane . Although they had no report of the hit-and-run , the deputies noticed the Dodge ' s shattered windshield and said that just as they were about to pull Martinez over , his car drifted toward them . According to the law_enforcement account , when Martinez refused to stop , the deputies pursued him at speeds as high as 85 m.p.h. Witnesses said the chase ended when Martinez hit a bus_stop sign -- and a second bicyclist -- as he was turning right . Authorities say he got_out of the car , ran and jumped a fence . A plainclothes police_officer joined the chase , captured Martinez and held him for the deputies to arrest . Tests showed that Martinez ' s blood alcohol level met the legal definition of drunk , prosecutor Kathy Cady says . Because Martinez has a drunk-driving conviction , she adds , the filing of the second-degree murder_charge is apt . &quot; It ' s the only thing that ' s left in terms of making a difference , &quot; says Wilson ' s boyfriend , cinematographer Jonathan Rho . Her sister , Kim Glasscock of Nashville , Tenn. , says she plans to attend Martinez ' s trial to make a statement about the damage caused by a hit-and-run driver . &quot; I am going_to put_up the fight that Kellie would have wanted to put this guy behind bars , &quot; she says . &quot; This person had complete control as_to whether or not this accident would happen . I guess that makes the anger more intense . And there is nothing we can do. &quot; Dangerous Driving California leads the nation in hit-and-run traffic accidents , with Los Angeles County accounting_for the lion ' s share . Moreover , California has far more hit-and-run traffic deaths than anywhere else in the United States . Here is how Los Angeles County compares to other California counties , according to 1992 statistics : Los Angeles County * Hit-and-run accidents : 38 # 960 * Killed or injured : 18 # 317 * Total accidents : 153 # 386 Orange County * Hit-and-runs : 7 # 214 * Killed or injured : 2 # 669 * Total accidents : 41 # 909 Alameda County * Hit-and-runs : 6 # 973 * Killed or injured : 1 # 450 * Total accidents : 29 # 574 San Diego County * Hit-and-runs : 4 # 301 * Killed or injured : 2 # 534 * Total accidents : 27 # 543 San Bernardino County * Hit-and-runs : 4 # 129 * Killed or injured : 1 # 452 * Total accidents : 25 # 782 Riverside County * Hit-and-runs : 2 # 966 * Killed or injured : 1 # 083 * Total accidents : 18 # 810 Santa Clara County * Hit-and-runs : 2 # 869 * Killed or injured : 1 # 340 * Total accidents : 20 # 989 Fresno County * Hit-and-runs : 2 # 517 * Killed or injured 986 * Total accidents : 9 # 458 Sacramento County * Hit-and-runs : 2 # 366 * Killed or injured : 1 # 097 * Total accidents : 17 # 739 San Joaquin County * Hit-and-runs : 2 # 328 * Killed or injured : 814 * Total accidents : 9 # 819 San Mateo County * Hit-and-runs : 2 # 165 * Killed or injured : 491 * Total accidents : 10 # 370 Contra Costa County * Hit-and-runs : 2 # 155 * Killed or injured : 552 * Total accidents : 11 # 637 San Francisco County * Hit-and-runs : 1 # 691 * Killed or injured : 1 # 089 * Total accidents : 8 # 481 Ventura County * Hit-and-runs : 1 # 489 * Killed or injured : 496 * Total accidents : 9 # 136 Fatalities Here are the five states with the most deaths occurring in hit-and-run crashes in 1992 .
