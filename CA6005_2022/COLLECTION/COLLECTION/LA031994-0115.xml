   <HEADLINE> JAPAN MET GOAL ON FOREIGN CHIPS IN 4TH QUARTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States ' roller-coaster trade relationship with Japan tentatively moved_into an upswing Friday , with the disclosure that Japanese industries purchased slightly more_than 20 % of their semiconductors from foreign suppliers during the final three months of 1993 . The foreign share of the market , a gain of more_than two percentage_points over the previous quarter , returns Japan to compliance with an informal target established with the United States in 1986 and renewed in 1991 . But the Japanese have hit the 20 % target , intended to increase U.S. access to the Japanese computer market , only once in the past , and U.S. officials said the recent purchase level must be sustained . The semiconductor agreement is unrelated to the more contentious and unresolved questions surrounding the broad scope of U.S.-Japanese trade that are encompassed in the stalled &quot; framework &quot; talks , which fell_apart five weeks ago . Japan objected to the Clinton_Administration ' s insistence that objective criteria be established to measure increases in U.S. access to the Japanese market for automobiles and auto parts , medical equipment , telecommunications_equipment and insurance . But U.S. trade officials took the progress being eked out by foreign manufacturers of semiconductors as a sign of positive movement and one that suggests Japanese government and industry are not strictly obstructionist . &quot; It shows ( that ) when they put their minds to it , things really happen , &quot; a senior U.S. trade official said . &quot; Hopefully , it bodes well for a major proposal at the end of the month. &quot; Japan has said it will produce a plan by the end of March to get the framework talks back on track . The U.S. trade representative ' s office announced that Japanese companies purchased 20.7 % of their semiconductors -- the microcircuits that are the heart of computer_technology -- from foreign producers during the final quarter of 1993 . During the previous quarter , the figure was 18.1 % . The Semiconductor Industry Assn . in San Jose said the improved fourth-quarter report brought the yearly average to 19.4 % , an increase of two percentage_points over 1992 . Roughly 85 % of Japan ' s foreign-made computer chips were manufactured in the United States , according to Kevin Brett , a spokesman for the association . Sen . Max Baucus ( D-Mont. ) , chairman of the Senate Finance international trade subcommittee , said the figures released Friday prove that &quot; setting benchmarks and applying pressure does work. &quot; &quot; Unfortunately , Japan seems to play by the rules only when the referee is watching , &quot; he said . With the breakdown of the framework talks , the Clinton_Administration has tried , step by step , to increase pressure on Tokyo , announcing earlier this month that it was reinstating a provision in U.S. trade law that would allow it to eventually impose sanctions on Japan for unfair trade practices . In Japan , meanwhile , the trade minister rejected U.S. pressure for the government to guarantee his nation ' s auto_makers ' plans to increase imports of U.S.-made parts . Horoshi Kumagai also was reported to have said that he favors getting_rid_of the voluntary limits Japan has placed on its exports of automobiles to the United States . &quot; Has the U.S._government shown any appreciation for our efforts on earlier voluntary export restraints ? No , &quot; Kumagai said to reporters . At its center , the dispute between the two nations is over the size of the Japanese trade surplus with the United States -- $ 59.3 billion last year -- and over the difficulty U.S. companies have had in selling their products and services in Japan . The 1986 semiconductor agreement is just one of the government-to-government pacts intended to pry open the Japanese market .</TEXT>
