   <HEADLINE> SENDING MESSAGE OF HISTORY TO JAPAN ; EMPEROR ' S VISIT : ASIAN AMERICANS FROM SAN GABRIEL VALLEY JOIN PROTESTERS SEEKING APOLOGY FOR ATROCITIES DURING 1930S AND ' 40S .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It might have been a parade , snaking down an entire city_block with Korean folk drummers , Chinese flags and Buddhist monks with flowing robes and shaved heads . But the placards gave the truth away . &quot; Japan , Apologize , Do Not Distort History , &quot; one sign said . &quot; Asian Holocaust , the Forgotten Holocaust , &quot; read another . &quot; Japanese Militarism Is Nazism , &quot; said a third . Three of the placards were held aloft proudly by Gloria Tong of Monterey Park and her daughters Faith , 12 , and Sheena , 8 . The Tongs were among 400 Asian Americans , many from the San Gabriel Valley , who marched for three miles in the hot sun last Tuesday , weaving from Chinatown to City_Hall to the Japanese Consulate to demand that the Japanese emperor -- who was lunching with Mayor Richard Riordan in Downtown Los Angeles -- apologize and pay reparations to victims of crimes against humanity committed by his country during World_War_II . A similar protest held two weeks ago in Barnes Park in Monterey Park drew 400 protesters . Tong said she brought her children to the demonstration because &quot; they ' re Chinese , they should learn about the massacres by the Japanese , and they ' re not going_to learn it in school . &quot; Through this protest , at least the Japanese emperor can bring_back a message to his people , &quot; Tong said . &quot; Kids in the new Japanese generation need to know the truth . The government should pass_on to a new generation that they did something wrong . They have to recognize and say they did it. &quot; Unlike Germany , which was forced to atone publicly for its war_crimes , Japan has successfully downplayed its role as an aggressor in World_War_II , and Japanese history textbooks make few references_to the estimated 30 million people that Japanese troops killed from 1931 to 1945 in China , Korea and Southeast_Asia . Emperor Akihito has expressed &quot; regret &quot; over the war between Japan and the United States , but has not formally apologized to the United States for his country ' s role in the war . Kaoruko Sasamoto , press officer for the Japanese Embassy in Washington , disputed the number of people killed by Japanese troops , adding : &quot; Japan is deeply remorseful about the events of great dimension ( that occurred during the war ) and the suffering and sadness caused to the people of the United States and Asia . Based on this , Japan has decided to be a pacifist country and contribute to world peace and prosperity. &quot; The controversy over reparations has only grown hotter with the passage of time . While demands for apologies and reparation did not come_up during Emperor Hirohito ' s 1975 visit to the United States , they are being pressed upon his son nearly 20 years later . The popularity of the movie &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; has spurred on Asian Americans , some civic_leaders say . &quot; We see the Holocaust West being publicized , but no one ' s talking_about the Holocaust East , &quot; said Ting Huang , a spokesman for one of the organizing groups , United Against Japan for Justice and Reparations Committee , which is based in Alhambra . The committee was one of several groups that presented the Japanese Consulate with a letter to Akihito . A letter from the reparations committee asked Akihito to &quot; assume the historic responsibilities for the Japanese aggression against China and the world , thus closing one of the most shameful and barbaric eras in Japan ' s history. &quot; While the war is more_than half a century old , many of the protesters were young . Alex Fan of Temple City , whose father was executed by the Japanese in Shanghai during the war , brought his son Fred , 23 . The younger Fan said he was there to prevent history from being whitewashed . &quot; I ' ve heard a lot of things from the Japanese , like , ' can ' t you just forget it , it was 50 years ago , ' but that ' s like telling the Jews , ' can ' t you just accept the Holocaust , ' or telling Japanese Americans , ' can ' t you just accept the internment_camps , ' &quot; Fan said . Lang Yun , a South Pasadena filmmaker and Southern California chairwoman of the Washington-based reparations committee , was another who marched . &quot; Before Pearl_Harbor , millions and millions of Chinese were slaughtered at the hands of the Japanese , and the world turned a deaf ear . I just don ' t understand it , &quot; Yun said . In 1987 Yun traveled_to Nanjing to film a documentary about the massacre of an estimated 300 # 000 people killed at the hands of Japanese troops in Nanking . &quot; We want the world to know what happened , &quot; said Yun , 60 . Some Japanese American groups , politicized by their fight for reparations from the U.S._government for the internment_camps of World_War_II , are also putting pressure on Japan . One who drew cheers Tuesday was David Monkawa , staff director of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Committee for Redress and Reparations , a Japanese American organization . &quot; Unfortunately , we ( Japanese Americans ) are one of the only groups to get reparations for crimes , but we ' re here to offer our heartfelt and undying support to get reparations for all those of you who have been victims of Japanese imperialism in World_War_II , &quot; Monkawa said . Times special correspondent Kevin Uhrich contributed to this story .</TEXT>
