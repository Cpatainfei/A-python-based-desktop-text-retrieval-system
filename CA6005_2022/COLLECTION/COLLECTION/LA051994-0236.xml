   <TEXT> Astronomers taking a closer look_at Mercury , the nearest planet to the sun , have confirmed the existence of frozen water in an arid , airless land where daylight is hot enough to melt lead . The planet ' s lakes of ice , cupped in polar craters miles across and shielded by constant shadows , may be millions of years old , said researchers at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory and the National Astronomy Center at Arecibo , Puerto Rico . The finding is surprising , in part because Mercury is so close to the sun that the temperature at its equator reaches 800 degrees Fahrenheit . It is , said one UCLA planetary scientist , like finding &quot; snowballs in hell. &quot; &quot; I don ' t think there is any question that it is real , &quot; said David A . Paige , a professor of planetary science at UCLA . &quot; It is very impressive. &quot; The research , based on new high-resolution radar maps of Mercury , is published in today ' s issue of the science journal Nature . The study offers convincing evidence that one of the rarest commodities in the inner solar_system -- the water that gives the orb of Earth its distinctive blue hue when viewed from space -- may be more abundant than has been thought . It also gives additional impetus to the theory that the Earth ' s moon may also harbor secret reserves of water in its polar regions and may have an important impact on any future human exploration of the moon , scientists said . &quot; We don ' t know if there is water on the moon , but now there is a better reason to look , &quot; said Bruce Murray , an expert on planetary science and geology at Caltech . Murray was among the first to raise the possibility , more_than 30 years ago , that water might be found on the moon . &quot; If you find it on Mercury , you certainly expect to find it on the moon , &quot; Murray said . &quot; If there are ice deposits on the moon hidden in these craters , that would to me at least change the game a great_deal about where you put a lunar base. &quot; The suggestion that Mercury could have water was first raised about two years ago when radar images of the planet revealed distinctive bright , reflective patches near its poles . The radar_echoes reflected by these patches were characteristic of water , the researchers said , but they were initially unsure why any water reserves had not boiled away long ago under the hellish conditions on Mercury ' s surface . Paige theorized that at the poles , where the sun ' s light would cast permanent shadows across the floors of large craters , it could be cold enough -- well below 32 degrees Fahrenheit -- to preserve frozen water for billions of years . Scientists have not ruled_out the possibility that the ice is protected by a thin layer of soil , which would be transparent to the radar signals broadcast from Earth . &quot; When they first discovered that the poles of Mercury had these anomalous bright spots , it wasn ' t clear what they were , &quot; Paige said . Impact craters immediately came_to_mind . &quot; These are places there where the sun never shone . The sun never peeks down into the crater , &quot; Paige said . The recent radar studies were detailed enough to line_up the reflective patches with known craters on Mercury , apparently confirming the idea . Older and more eroded craters did not contain the deposits .</TEXT>
