   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : SPECIAL REPORT ; O.C. SOFTWARE FIRM FINDS A QUICK , ON-LINE SOLUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When a client ' s software glitch in Cuxhaven , Germany , threatened to delay shipping along the Elbe_River near Hamburg last spring , programmers at Wonderware Corp. ' s Orange County headquarters immediately began looking_for a fix late that same evening , Hamburg time . The programmers examined copies of the software code that a company engineer in Cuxhaven downloaded to them in Irvine via Compuserve , one of a half-dozen on-line services that allow computer users to exchange electronic_mail and review data . The troubled program was used to convert analog radar signals into digital form so they could be read by a computer that monitored ship traffic . Several hours later , the faulty program was corrected and returned to Germany . Before Wonderware began using the on-line service in September , 1993 , such a repair would have taken days of shipping disks across the Atlantic by express_mail . &quot; You can answer questions from Germany or Japan about 10 minutes after you get them , &quot; said Rashesh Mody , a Wonderware manager for technical support . Before it began using Compuserve , he said , &quot; we sometimes sent faxes back and forth , but you can ' t keep track of all_the information in that form. &quot; For software companies that have come_to depend_on such on-line services to distribute and update their products , choosing among providers like Compuserve , Prodigy Services Co . and America Online Inc. has become as important as choosing among competing long-distance telephone_companies . Some companies are tied more directly to the Internet to respond to customers ' inquiries and stay in touch with far-flung sales representatives . The Internet is a worldwide computing standard that links more_than 3 million computers . Like many Orange County software companies , Wonderware has a foot in each camp -- a subscription to an on-line service as well as a customized Internet address registered in the company ' s own name . Ken Forster , a Wonderware project manager , said the company ' s presence on the Internet and on Compuserve has been beneficial . &quot; We had two factions arguing which was the better way to go , so we decided to do both , &quot; he said . Much of the company ' s software repairs and updates are shipped through its Compuserve account , while the company ' s Internet address -- which is maintained through another provider -- Netcom On-line Communication Services Inc. in San Francisco -- is available to greater numbers of Wonderware ' s customers . With an added on-line dependence , Forster and other on-line managers are considering a possible market shake-up in 1995 , driven by the introduction of a new service by software giant Microsoft Corp. , based in Redmond , Wash . The Microsoft Network will allow PC users to go on-line directly through its popular Windows program , which is installed on nearly 60 million computers and is seen as serious competition for the established service providers like Compuserve , Prodigy and America Online . * Despite the attention Microsoft has received since announcing its service at Comdex , the giant trade show in Las Vegas last month , local business users say they don ' t expect the network will drastically affect their own operations . The competition among service providers , they say , will rest_on which can provide more access to the Internet itself . Microsoft ' s network &quot; is another service we ' ll definitely have to look_at , &quot; said Bruce Quigley , director of sales and marketing at Smith Micro Software Inc. in Aliso Viejo . &quot; I ' d have to see it in_use before I can say whether we ' d want to be_on it or not . It has to do with what our customer base wants too. &quot; The privately held company , with about 75 employees , already has two employees to handle technical support inquiries on its Compuserve account , he said , and is considering setting_up additional support service through America Online and Apple Computer ' s electronic service . Microsoft isn ' t discussing specifics of its service , though trade journals suggest the network initially will only allow users to send and receive e-mail via the ' net and to participate in discussion groups . &quot; If they don ' t have good Internet access , they ' re toast , &quot; said Mark Jenkins , an editor at Interactive Week , a trade journal in Garden City , N.Y. Whereas the leading service providers today charge fees based on the time users are connected , Microsoft may base its fees on how much information users download or how much mail they transmit , Jenkins said . As in other areas of the United States , interest in the Internet is increasing exponentially in Orange County as measured by the number of companies that have registered a name on the network through the Internet Network Information Center , a project funded by the National Science Foundation . For the 714 telephone area_code , 218 new commercial names were registered this year through Nov . 15 , compared with just 81 names for all_of 1993 , according to Michael J . Walsh , president of Internet Info , a market research firm in Falls Church , Va. , that analyzes the registrations . &quot; It ' s almost like taking a snapshot of the United States and saying , ' These are the high-tech centers , ' &quot; Walsh said . &quot; It ' s got nothing to do with the geography ; it ' s got everything to do with the high-techishness of the regions. &quot; For every name registered , there can be dozens or more actual users . The largest cluster of Internet users in Orange County is connected through UC Irvine . David Walker , assistant director of the UCI office of academic computing , estimates about half of the school ' s 16 # 000 students and as_many as two-thirds of its 5 # 000 faculty and staff have individual accounts . Because all those accounts have the same ending designation -- &quot; uci.edu. &quot; -- they would be counted just once by most surveys of users , making_it difficult to calculate exact demographics . Because businesses on the network tend to be smaller , however , the number of names ending in &quot; com , &quot; the designation for commercial or business users , makes the InterNIC count a helpful measure of business use . &quot; It correlates to the fact that the most commercial stuff is being done_in California , &quot; said Allen Weiner , principal analyst for on-line strategies at Dataquest Inc. , a San Jose-based market research firm . &quot; A lot of them are just homesteading , staking a claim , putting_up their fence post . . . but they ' re hoping that somebody who ' s surfing ( the Internet ) is going_to find them. &quot; * Because there is no cost to register a name , some analysts suggest that the rush of new registrations is partially a defensive move by companies to prevent others from capturing their brand name . Two of the best-known cases involved individuals who registered &quot; coke.com &quot; and &quot; mtv.com &quot; to themselves . In another case , a competitor to the Stanley H . Kaplan Educational Center registered &quot; kaplan.com &quot; as its own name . On-line managers in Orange County say they don ' t know of local instances of trade_names being poached . Of the commercial addresses registered to companies or individuals in Orange County , the majority belong_to computer_hardware or software companies , such_as AST Research Inc. in Irvine ( &quot; ast.com &quot; ) , Filenet Corp . ( &quot; filenet.com &quot; ) in Costa Mesa and Ingram Micro Inc. ( &quot; ingram.com &quot; ) in Santa Ana . One local address that is not registered to a computer company is &quot; medicaldata.com , &quot; acquired last May by Medical Data International Inc. of Irvine , an information consulting_company that works with medical equipment manufacturers and health_care_providers . Kevin Hicks , an information technology manager there , said 25 to 50 messages are transmitted each day between the company ' s 41 on-site employees , five off-site consultants and researchers , and its customers and readers . About half of its message traffic is between its 46 employees , the other half between employees and customers . &quot; The medical industry is pretty unsavvy about computers in_general , &quot; he said . He said he ' s not surprised it ' s mostly software firms that have most addresses now , but that may change as biomedical companies and other industries set_up accounts . Hicks said his company plans to make more services available to customers early next year , which would allow customers to view catalogues or navigate public databases . Another user looking_to increase its services on the network is Zyxel Corp. , an Anaheim modem manufacturer that uses its Internet connection to answer user questions and to offer free upgrades of its software . Brent Mosbrook , a Zyxel engineer , said reduced mailing costs and faster response for customers are the main benefits of having an on-line presence . &quot; People don ' t want to have to set_aside time to call us , they want the convenience of being able to post a question , then come_back and look_at the response a day later , &quot; he said . Mosbrook and others must balance that convenience against the security issues of opening their computers to the prowlers who could be drawn to an Internet address . The company is hoping to install an on-line ordering system as soon as protocols for protecting information transmitted on the Internet are developed , he said . &quot; It ' s more_than just credit_card numbers ; I want the whole order to be secure , &quot; Mosbrook said . &quot; I don ' t want anybody sniffing in there to see that ( Internet ) traffic. &quot; Only the gradual adoption of privacy measures for the Internet is likely to change the minds of Internet skeptics , said Donald Douglas Jolley , a networking consultant in Laguna Beach . &quot; If you ' re dealing with communications between two companies on a bulletin board-style system like Compuserve , you don ' t have the problems of your message traffic lying_around on several different computers , &quot; Jolley said . &quot; If you ' re strictly talking_about communicating company to company , that ' s an advantage to using a service provider in preference to the Internet . &quot; The Internet ' s advantage is that it ' s a common_denominator , so you ' ll be able to hear from anybody who wants to send you mail . . . and I ' m not sure that the smaller businesses , other_than the software houses , are ready for what the Internet has to offer , beyond e-mail. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Internet Growth More_than 50 area_codes have in excess of 100 commercial Internet addresses -- called domains -- registered with InterNic , Internet ' s administrative center . Here ' s how Orange County stacks_up against other local area_codes as of Nov . 15 : Location ( area_code ) San Diego ( 619 ) : 543 Central Los Angeles ( 310 ) : 414 Orange County ( 714 ) : 352 East Los Angeles , Pasadena , San Fernando ( 818 ) : 301 West Los Angeles ( 213 ) : 140 San Bernardino , Riverside ( 909 ) : 56 Top Internet States More_than two-thirds of the 25 # 000 are in ten states . California is home to more_than one-quarter of them . Top 10 states with Internet commercial domains ( with percent of total ) : California : 5 # 287 ( 28.7 % ) Colorado : 1 # 260 ( 6.8 ) % Massachusetts : 1 # 227 ( 6.6 ) % New York : 1 # 179 ( 6.4 ) % Texas : 982 ( 5.3 ) % Virginia : 713 ( 3.8 ) % Illinois : 619 ( 3.3 ) % New Jersey : 595 ( 3.2 ) % Washington : 546 ( 2.9 ) % Pennsylvania : 504 ( 2.7 ) % Net Growth The increase in the number of commercial addresses has skyrocketed throughout Southern California over the past three years . Even for 909 , a code that did not exist until 1991 , there has been extensive growth : 05 # 11 , 06 # 06 , 06 # 06 Area_code 1991 1992 1993 1994 714 14 35 81 218 310 13 37 74 284 818 20 25 68 187 213 7 10 20 103 909 1 5 10 40 619 15 50 104 368 Sources : Internet Info , Falls Church , Va .
