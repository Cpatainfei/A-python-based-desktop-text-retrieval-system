   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : RYAN MIGHT BE THE TICKET FOR CARDINALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Season-ticket sales reportedly jumped from 27 # 000 to 40 # 000 the day the Arizona Cardinals hired Coach Buddy Ryan . &quot; It wasn ' t a surprise to me , &quot; Ryan told Chris Jenkins of the San Diego Union-Tribune . &quot; I went_to Philly and we sold 20 # 000 the first year . I figured the same thing would happen here . &quot; They know I ' m a winner . They ' re putting their money on it. &quot; Add Ryan : He plans to use versatile Chuck Levy , the team ' s second-round draft choice from Arizona , on two-point conversion plays next season . Ryan told the Arizona Daily Star that quarterback Steve Beuerlein probably won ' t be_on the field for two-point attempts . &quot; What we ' re trying to do is take_advantage of the situation , &quot; Ryan said . &quot; I ' m not going_to worry about hurting Beuerlein ' s feelings . If it does , I ' m not going_to worry about that too_much , either. &quot; Trivia time : Who holds the NBA playoff record for most points in one quarter ? Spaceman : Ernie Johnson Jr . of the Turner TV network , to USA Today on his interview with San Antonio ' s Dennis Rodman : &quot; The temptation after you talk to Dennis Rodman is to say , ' Next time you orbit the earth , Dennis , stop by and say hey. ' &quot; No put ( t ) on : From Golf Digest : &quot; The president of the South Texas section of the PGA of America ? Why , Bob Putt , of course. &quot; Night light : Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson says baseballs are more juiced than ever this season . After watching a fly_ball by Kansas City ' s Gary Gaetti land in the upper_deck at Tiger Stadium , Anderson remarked that the baseballs now have a lively glow and if you &quot; take a baseball to bed with you , it will keep you up all night. &quot; FYI : Before the NBA playoffs , former Laker Byron Scott , now with Indiana , had played in more postseason games , 142 , than the rest of the Pacers combined , 137 . Turnoff : Tom Pukstys , the American record-holder in the javelin , said that he used to admire baseball_players when he was younger . &quot; I remember a guy that used to play for the Cubs named Rick Reuschel , &quot; Pukstys told Track &amp; Field News . &quot; But then I see this guy and all I see is him chewing tobacco , spitting -- a real heavyset guy -- it just didn ' t appeal_to me that much. &quot; Looking_back : On this day in 1955 , Swaps , ridden by Bill Shoemaker , won the Kentucky_Derby by 1 1 / 2 lengths over Nashua . Stay away : Frank Luksa of the Dallas Morning News asked George Young , general manger of the New York Giants , to assess the Dallas Cowboys now that Barry Switzer is the new coach . &quot; ( Owner ) Jerry Jones isn ' t on the coaching staff yet , is he ? &quot; Young replied . &quot; Keep him off the coaching staff and Barry probably will do fine. &quot; Trivia answer : Eric ( Sleepy ) Floyd of Golden State , with 29 against the Lakers on May 10 , 1987 .
