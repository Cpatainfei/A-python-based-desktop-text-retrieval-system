   <HEADLINE> CLINTON HAILS UNITY , FREEDOM IN BERLIN ; GERMANY : VISIT EMPHASIZES U.S. DESIRE TO REBUILD EUROPE AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT ONCE BLEW IT APART .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton strode through Brandenburg Gate into the former East Berlin on Tuesday , declaring a &quot; monument to conquest &quot; and &quot; tyranny &quot; had now become a gateway to a united Europe . &quot; Nothing will stop us -- all things are possible , &quot; he told tens of thousands of Berliners massed at the structure that long obstructed Berlin ' s central boulevard . &quot; Berlin ist frei &quot; -- Berlin is free , the President exclaimed in German . Joined by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on a dais before snapping German and U.S. flags , Clinton said : &quot; We stand together where Europe ' s heart was cut_in half , and celebrate unity . We stand where cruel walls of concrete separated mother from child , and we meet as one family. &quot; The speech , in a city used as an oratorical prop for celebrated Cold_War speeches by Presidents John F . Kennedy and Ronald Reagan , closed an eight-day European trip partly focused_on Clinton ' s desire to rebuild Europe around the country that once blew it apart . The nine-minute address offered little in the way of new policy goals but referred again to Clinton ' s desire to give a leading role to Europe ' s biggest , wealthiest country . &quot; The Berlin Wall is gone , &quot; said Clinton , who passed beneath the 85-foot triumphal_arch as the first President since 1945 to walk on the soil of the former East_Germany . &quot; Now we must decide what we will build_in its place. &quot; Clinton , who later attended a ceremony marking the decommissioning of the Army_unit that long policed Berlin , alluded to the long ties between the Germans and the United States , the country that had helped rebuild and protect it after the Nazi era . The President invoked the memory of U.S. soldiers , the pilots who kept the 15-month Berlin airlift alive and the sentries at the famous Checkpoint Charlie border crossing . &quot; I say . . . America is_on your side , now and forever , &quot; he told his audience , in German and English , drawing a renewed roar from the crowd . Clinton praised Berliners ' courage , recalling how , for 28 years of the Berlin Wall , half of the city was &quot; encircled and the other half enslaved. &quot; He remembered how Berliners hurled stones at tanks in the aborted uprising of June 17 , 1953 and cited the &quot; civil courage &quot; that led East_Germans to begin agitation for an end to their regime five years ago . &quot; You turned your dreams of a better life into the chisels of liberty , &quot; he said . But he added that shaping the new era would not be easy . In an indirect reference_to anti-foreigner violence in Germany , Clinton said , &quot; We must reject those who would divide us with scalding words about race , ethnicity or religion. &quot; The speech added an upbeat closing note to a presidential trip marred by the embarrassment of a plummeting dollar and the rejection at last weekend ' s economic summit of a Clinton trade proposal . In Berlin -- a liberal city whose eastern sector gave the party run_by former Communists 40 % of the vote_in the last election -- signs of the struggles that have convulsed Germany were apparent Tuesday . * Clinton was met by lusty cheers when he appeared under the gate after a five-minute walk from the Reichstag , the German Parliament building , with Hillary Rodhman Clinton , Kohl and his wife , Hannelore . But the chancellor , who has struggled to guide Germany during its racking transition , was greeted with boos as he approached the microphone . Eberhard Diepgen , the conservative mayor of Berlin , was also booed . In his remarks , Kohl said that &quot; the experience of history demands that Germany does not stand on the sidelines when peace and freedom in Europe and the world are at stake. &quot; He said that , in the effort to knit a new Europe from the old Soviet empire , &quot; ' the dreadful news reaching us daily from Bosnia shows that we still have a long way to go_to reach our goal. &quot; Brandenburg Gate was modeled on an entry at the Acropolis and was intended as an emblem of Berliners ' aim to make their city another Athens . But over the years , as conquering armies passed beneath it , it became a symbol of militarism -- topped with an Iron Cross and Prussian eagle -- and later , a monument to the divided city . During the Communist years , the gate fell_into the eastern zone ; when Reagan delivered his wall speech in 1987 , East_German troops prowled atop it . Clinton spoke Tuesday as Berliners enjoyed an uncharacteristic spell of sunny weather during a season when the air is sweetened by the scent of blooming linden_trees . The crowd was swelled by children given a holiday to attend the President ' s speech . The brash colors of their U.S.-style clothing mingled with the sober tones of older Berliners and east_Germans . Clinton had struggled with his pronunciation of foreign languages earlier in the trip , in Latvia and Poland , and some aides hoped he would not try_out the German he learned in three years of high_school study . Some critics have pointed_out that Kennedy ' s phrase &quot; Ich bin ein Berliner , &quot; from his 1963 speech at the Berlin City_Hall , was ungrammatical ; it meant , literally , the President was a jelly-filled pastry . But Clinton risked slip-ups three times in the speech with German expressions and seemed to satisfy his listeners . &quot; He ' s got_it down well , &quot; said German listener Andreas Schultz . Many Berliners in the crowd spoke favorably of Clinton -- the older ones often because of their warm memories of America ' s postwar role and the younger ones because they found Clinton young and appealing . &quot; This is something I never thought I would see in my life , &quot; said Uwe Weimann , a retired manager for a large chemical company and a veteran of the 1945 Battle of Berlin . &quot; I am extremely happy that toward the end of my life , I can see positive things. &quot; * Later , Clinton presided over a ceremony deactivating the U.S. Army ' s elite Berlin Brigade , organized in 1961 to oversee military operations in Berlin . Although it never fired a hostile shot , the unit oversaw the exchange of political_prisoners and the operations of the well-known Checkpoint Charlie . Clinton reviewed the 1 # 000 troops and watched as the flag flying over Ft . McNair was lowered . It was presented to him to take_back to the United States . &quot; We are marking the end of a half-century of sacrifice on freedom ' s frontier , &quot; the President said . &quot; America salutes you . Mission accomplished. &quot;</TEXT>
