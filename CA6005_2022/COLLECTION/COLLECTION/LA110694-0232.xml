   <HEADLINE> OZONE MONITOR ABOARD SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS FAILS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They cooled_it down , then warmed it up . They turned it off and on , again and again . Nothing worked -- a German ozone monitor flying_on the space shuttle Atlantis refused to collect data despite ground controllers ' coaxing . Researchers were not giving_up , but they held_out little hope Saturday . &quot; Realistically speaking , we feel that there is very little chance of obtaining any more science data , &quot; said Gerd Hartmann , a German scientist in_charge of the experiment . All the other atmospheric and solar-energy monitors aboard Atlantis , as well as those on a satellite released by the astronauts , were working well . The problem with the ozone instrument began Friday when the data link between it and ground controllers was lost , apparently because of a computer malfunction . The monitor had worked fine when it was turned_on Thursday , just hours after Atlantis rocketed into its 190-mile-high orbit , and collected six hours of high-quality data . A sudden surge of current in the instrument ' s electronics may have burned_out one or more components , Hartmann said . Controllers at NASA ' s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , turned the monitor off for 1 1 / 2 hours while it was facing away from the sun to cool the system and get_it working . When that failed , they turned the instrument off while it was facing the sun to heat the system . That didn ' t work either . More of the same was planned . There was little else controllers could do because they could not communicate with the monitor ' s computer , Hartmann said . This is the third time in 2 1 / 2 years that the ozone monitor has flown_on a space shuttle . The instrument was supposed to measure the distribution of water_vapor , chlorine monoxide and ozone between 12 miles and 60 miles high . It has a dish-shaped antenna to scan Earth ' s horizon . Chlorine monoxide is formed in the atmosphere by the breakdown of chlorofluorocarbons , which are used in refrigerators and air conditioners and are a leading cause of ozone loss . Major industrial nations have agreed to eliminate these chemicals by the end of the decade . The thin , invisible layer of ozone in the stratosphere protects against dangerous ultraviolet rays , which can cause skin_cancer and cataracts and weaken immune_systems . The defective instrument is not the only ozone gauge flying_on Atlantis during its 11-day mission . Ozone is also being analyzed by telescopes aboard the satellite dropped_off by the astronauts Friday . None of these other instruments , however , measures chlorine monoxide . &quot; That is one piece of the puzzle that we would like to have , &quot; NASA mission scientist Tim Miller said . &quot; So we are disappointed. &quot; After one day of free flight , the satellite ' s infrared telescopes had recorded more_than 2 million spectra , or wavelength images . Scientists hope to collect as_many as 10 million images before the six-member shuttle crew captures the satellite next Saturday for the trip home . The mission is_due to end Nov . 14 .</TEXT>
