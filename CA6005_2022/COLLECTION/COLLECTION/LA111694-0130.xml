   <HEADLINE> REBEL WITH A CAUSE ABANDONS THE LIMELIGHT ; POLITICS : COMMON CAUSE ' S FRED WERTHEIMER IS ABOUT TO TAKE A BREAK . WILL CONGRESS GET ONE ? NOT A CHANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fred Wertheimer looks_like the friendly neighbor in a sitcom -- the bald , bespectacled older guy dispensing advice to the nice young folks next door . But mention his name on Capitol_Hill and the reaction can be anything but neighborly . &quot; He acts_as though he has a monopoly on reforming the political process , &quot; sputtered Rep . Robert Torricelli ( D-N.J. ) , a target of Wertheimer ' s lobby , Common Cause . &quot; The cause of campaign-finance reform will move more quickly with him gone. &quot; After nearly a quarter-century of prodding politicians to change the way they raise money to run_for office , Wertheimer announced in October that he was resigning from the leadership of Common Cause . In his almost 24 years with the self-described good-government lobby , 14 of them as president , he has exasperated and infuriated scores of officials , along the way becoming almost as much an institution in this city as the system he would so like to reform . Long before Congress-bashing was fashionable , Wertheimer was inveighing against the &quot; corrupt &quot; advantages of incumbency and the &quot; arms-race mentality &quot; of political_campaigns . In October , a combination of Democratic delay and a Republican filibuster killed the best chance yet to limit campaign spending , reduce the role of political-action committees and extend public financing -- already provided to presidential candidates -- to congressional races . &quot; If Congress had enacted the ( recent ) reforms urged_on it by Fred Wertheimer , it would have a much higher approval rating from the American people , &quot; said Sen . David Boren ( D-Okla. ) , one of Wertheimer ' s few defenders on the_Hill . But others said Wertheimer was part of the problem , adopting a rigid attitude that delayed agreement until it was too late to pass legislation . &quot; Fred has worshiped at the altar of public financing for so_long that he would sell his first-born son for it , &quot; said Rep . Mike Synar ( D-Okla. ) . Wertheimer said his decision to step_down had been made months earlier and that personal criticism wasn ' t a factor . At 55 , he would n ' t have lasted this long if he were thin-skinned . Ohio Congressman Wayne Hays , the salty-tongued chairman of the House Administration Committee in the 1970s , used to call him that &quot; baldheaded bastard &quot; from &quot; Common Curse. &quot; &quot; I tend to take almost nothing that happens up there ( Capitol_Hill ) personally , &quot; Wertheimer said in an interview at Common Cause headquarters . &quot; There is an inherent tension built into what Common Cause does . Our issues are quite different than those of other people who worry about clean air or having a dam built . We are talking_about your personal life , your professional_life , your money and your integrity . It ' s going_to lead to people getting angry with you. &quot; In the aftermath of the Nov . 8 elections , Wertheimer , who will remain at Common Cause until a successor is chosen next year , promised to be just as tough on the new Republican leadership in Congress as he has been_on the Democrats . Even though many Hill watchers believe the chances for reform will be slimmer , Wertheimer said he sees a big opportunity to push Republicans to keep their promises of change . He said he would focus_on the next House Speaker , Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) , &quot; because he has spent his career attacking the House as a corrupt institution. &quot; * As Wertheimer talked_about the subject that has absorbed most of his adult life , he looked his questioner straight in the eyes with an intensity that was a little disconcerting and gave a sense of how uncomfortable he has made politicians feel . Born and bred in Brooklyn , a graduate of the University of Michigan and Harvard Law_School , he imbibed his reformist zeal from an accountant father who &quot; believed_in playing by the rules &quot; and a mother with &quot; a great sense of fairness and justice. &quot; Like so many in his generation , Wertheimer said President John F . Kennedy ' s call to public_service was also a powerful influence . Ironically , Wertheimer ' s first goal was to work_on Capitol_Hill , which he pursued with characteristic determination . &quot; I got a job at the Securities and Exchange Commission and every six months would send_out letters to 20 or 30 congressmen who sounded interesting . Three years later , Silvio Conte wrote back . &quot; Conte ( D-Mass. ) was a wonderful representative and a great teacher , &quot; said Wertheimer , who worked for the congressman for a_few years . &quot; I ' ve had wonderful teachers and mentors and colleagues , like John Gardner and ( Watergate prosecutor and former Common Cause chairman ) Archibald Cox. &quot; Gardner , a liberal Republican who served as secretary of Health , Education and Welfare in the Johnson Administration , founded Common Cause in 1970 to open government to greater public scrutiny and participation . The organization reached its membership peak of 300 # 000 in the Watergate era and now has about 250 # 000 members and chapters in all states except Wyoming , Idaho and Alaska . In the beginning , its tactics were relatively genteel , but got_tougher in the face of continuing resistance to campaign-finance reform primarily from House Democrats and Senate Republicans . In a controversial tactic in 1990 , Common Cause took_out ads against 13 Democrats , among them Torricelli , implying that their acceptance of PAC money in_general implicated them in the savings and loan debacle . &quot; It was a major blunder , &quot; said Kenneth Gross , former head of enforcement at the Federal Election_Commission and now a lawyer specializing in campaign finance and ethics at the Washington office of the New York firm Skadden , Arps . &quot; These were his supporters -- not ( Sen. ) Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) . He went_for the jugular , &quot; Gross said . Wertheimer , not surprisingly , disagreed . &quot; Democrats kept campaign-finance reform off the floor of the House for 16 years . Then ( in 1990 ) they came_forward with a phony bill and they wanted it blessed as reform . . . . &quot; There ' s this unbelievably difficult concept for Washington to understand : In order to change , you have to change . Washington loves the notion of change without doing anything. &quot; Although recent efforts have failed , Common Cause claims numerous successes : public funding of presidential campaigns ; &quot; sunshine , &quot; or open-meeting laws ; tougher ethics rules for the executive_branch ; the investigation that led to the resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright ( D-Texas ) , and the 1989 bill that banned members of Congress from accepting speaking fees from special-interest groups . Another contribution to the political process was_on view outside Wertheimer ' s office just before the recent elections . A group of young staffers sat munching bagels while turning reports filed to the Federal Election_Commission into press_releases on campaign spending . * Wertheimer has been with the group almost since its inception . He sought a job there after leaving Conte ' s office , while his wife , Linda , briefly supported him . &quot; In the fall of 1970 , we had been married for about a year and this place was just being formed . I knew I could do something I didn ' t want to do any time , so why rush into it ? We decided Linda should find a job . There was this new thing called National Public Radio . that ' s how Linda started at NPR and I started_out at Common Cause. &quot; Linda Wertheimer rose from being a tape editor to host of the acclaimed program &quot; All Things Considered. &quot; Together , the Wertheimers , who have no children , occupy a niche in the city ' s liberal Establishment . They relax with journalist friends such_as Cokie and Steven Roberts ( the former with NPR and ABC , the latter with U.S. News &amp; World Report ) . Although ties with the media -- especially the editorial boards of major newspapers -- are said to be a key factor_in his influence , Wertheimer said the couple doesn ' t &quot; spend a whole_lot of time socializing with the power_structure in this town . We ' re old . We ' re tired. &quot; Asked to describe his typical engagements in a month , he said , &quot; Going_to a_couple_of movies on a Saturday night and dinner at the Pines of Rome , &quot; an untrendy restaurant in suburban Bethesda , Md . &quot; Fred lives by all_the rules he tries to force down other people ' s throats , &quot; said Nina Totenberg , legal affairs correspondent for NPR and the ABC TV_program &quot; Night-line. &quot; In characteristically prudent fashion , she said , the Wertheimers ' mortgage on their Georgetown townhouse was paid_up before they bought a spacious Victorian bungalow in Washington ' s premier wealthy liberal neighborhood , Cleveland Park . Besides the new house , another luxury they have permitted themselves is trips to Paris for major birthdays . They may travel more once his successor is chosen , Wertheimer said . He was otherwise unsure of his future except to say that he will remain involved in the reform effort . &quot; I do like fighting for what I believe_in , &quot; he said , his eyes shining . Reminded of all_the politicians he has tangled_with over the years , he looked suddenly youthful , and grinned . &quot; To the extent that my resignation makes a number of people happy -- well , whatever I can do to bring happiness into this world , &quot; he said . &quot; On the other hand , they shouldn ' t be too happy if they think I ' m going_to disappear from their lives . I ' m going_to be around. &quot;</TEXT>
