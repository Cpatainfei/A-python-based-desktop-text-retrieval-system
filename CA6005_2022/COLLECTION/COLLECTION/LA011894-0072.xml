   <HEADLINE> WORLD_VIEW ; LEARNING TO GIVE AS MUCH AS WE TAKE FROM EARTH ; * ' SUSTAINABILITY ' OFFERS HOPE FOR ACTIVISTS WHO SAY THE HUMAN SPECIES IS MULTIPLYING FASTER THAN RENEWABLE RESOURCES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a tiny overcrowded office at the Brookings Institution , a prominent Washington think_tank , a new computer_program code-named &quot; Sugarscape &quot; has simulated the patterns of life -- and created new visions of the Earth ' s future . Some 7 # 500 miles away in Arabuko Sokoke , the largest remaining coastal forest in East Africa , Kenya ' s Museum Society has launched a new program with the Giriama tribe to harvest butterflies for export -- and to help alleviate local poverty . And in El Paraiso , Honduras , World Neighbors , an Oklahoma-based humanitarian aid group , is teaching women to make basic medicines out of back-yard plants -- cough syrup out of bougainvillea flowers , for example -- both to improve their health and their self-esteem . The link between Brookings , butterflies and El Paraiso is one of the broad new principles -- and buzzwords -- now giving direction and shape to the post-Cold War world : sustainability . Promoted by the U.N. World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987 , sustainability was originally defined as efforts that &quot; meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the needs of future generations. &quot; In other words , encouraging economic_growth while also preserving the environment -- goals once considered incompatible . But seven years later , the term is also associated with a quiet revolution redefining the national security agenda , overhauling concepts of foreign_aid and providing a great new impetus to political change worldwide . It ' s effectively become a new barometer of human progress . &quot; Sustainable development is the sine_qua_non of the new_world order , &quot; said Gus Speth , U.N. Development Program chief . &quot; Sustainability is now essential to achieve all_of the major international goals of the United States or any other country -- peace , democratization , disease control , migration control , environmental protection and population stabilization. &quot; The revolution comes none too soon . The Worldwatch Institute ' s &quot; State of the World 1994 , &quot; published this week , offers several dire new warnings , including one on food scarcity . After 40 years of record food production gains , output per person has reversed with &quot; unanticipated abruptness. &quot; Human demands are now &quot; approaching the limits of oceanic fisheries to supply fish , of rangelands to support livestock , and , in many countries , of the hydrological cycle to produce fresh_water , &quot; it reports . By 1993 , the fish catch per person had declined 7 % from a historic high in 1989 . Grain production per person in 1993 was 11 % less than in the peak year of 1984 . &quot; The world ' s farmers can no longer be counted_on to feed the projected additions to our numbers . . . . As the nineties unfold , the world is facing a day_of_reckoning , &quot; Worldwatch warns . The report is only the latest red flag . In 1992 , 1 # 600 scientists , including 102 Nobel laureates , issued a &quot; warning to humanity. &quot; &quot; No more_than one or a_few decades remain before the chance to avert the threats we now confront will be lost and the prospects for humanity immeasurably diminished . . . . A new ethic is required ( which ) must motivate a great movement , convincing reluctant leaders and reluctant governments and reluctant peoples themselves to effect the needed changes , &quot; it said . Sustainability appears to be the most effective response , according to U.N. , U.S. and World_Bank development specialists . &quot; Development thinking has progressed from a focus_on per capita income in the 1960s to social indicators in the 1970s to political dimensions in the 1980s to environmental sustainability concerns in the 1990s , &quot; Speth said . Over 70 countries have established councils on sustainable development , while the five-year U.N. development program has been revised to focus_on sustainable projects . Even the World_Bank , often criticized for shortchanging ecology issues , now helps borrowers with &quot; environmental action plans. &quot; And last year , the United States adopted sustainability as a policy goal . Yet a key problem of sustainability is that neither ecologists nor economists have fully determined Earth ' s limits -- or how sustainability can soon be achieved , according to John D . Steinbruner , director of foreign_policy studies at Brookings . All past projections were flawed . In the 18th Century , English economist Thomas_Malthus ' theory on the geometric spiral of population growth and its environmental impact turned_out to be simplistic . In the 1970s , the Club of Rome ' s predictions about the future were widely believed to be excessively alarmist . And despite studies of the Worldwatch Institute and other groups , many mainstream economists contend market forces are sufficiently flexible to alleviate future ecological threats . Creating a Model To help finally settle that debate , Brookings , the World Resources Institute and the Santa Fe Institute have launched Project 2050 , a collaborative project to address critical questions . What constitutes a sustainable society ? What is the critical time_period ? And what strategies promote sustainability ? At think_tanks and universities around the world , Project 2050 participants are now engaged in high-tech studies of obvious issues like climate and population as well as far-flung variables such_as cultural differences and new political actors . The mission of Brookings ' &quot; Sugarscape , &quot; developed by Joshua Epstein and Robert Axtell , is to identify the basic rules of collective behavior through simulations . It ' s called Sugarscape because one program tracks the behavior of dozens of &quot; agents &quot; -- red and blue dots representing life_forms -- unleashed randomly on a screen with two sugar mountains , which represent resources . In the most basic simulation , all agents flock to one of the two mountains , around which they create two distinct cultures . As each society prospers , their growing populations tax resources , leading agents to forage between mountains -- and to either trade or combat between the two societies to survive . The lesson ? Confirmation of the basic_principle of &quot; carrying capacity &quot; -- or the largest_number of any species a habitat can support indefinitely -- and the dangers of exceeding it . Most ecologists long believed that when a population exceeds carrying capacity resources decline -- then so does the species . And that point may be nearing -- or here . &quot; As a result of our population size , consumption patterns and technology choices , we have surpassed the planet ' s carrying capacity , &quot; Worldwatch warns . The implications may be sweeping . &quot; The ideological conflict that dominated the four decades from 1950 to 1990 is being replaced by conflict between steadily growing demand for food and the Earth ' s physical capacity to satisfy those demands , &quot; it claims . &quot; The deteriorating balance between food and people . . . will increasingly preoccupy national political_leaders , reorder national priorities and dominate international affairs. &quot; Sugarscape represents the theoretical search for sustainability and long-term guidelines . But the term has multiple definitions and applications . Other more tangible , short-term projects deal with everything from poverty and women ' s rights to AIDS . Butterflies in Kenya One new model is the Kenya Museum Society ' s butterfly program , which reflects the shift away from big-buck , high-tech mega-projects based on foreign expertise that were a hallmark of foreign_aid during the Cold_War . The new emphasis is_on low-cost micro-projects sustainable by local people . It also exemplifies the new approach to the problem of deforestation . Since the mid-1970s , 10 % of Kenyan forests have been cut_down for crop lands or wood products , and polls show most tribes near Arabuko Sokoke -- the Giriama , Digo , Duruma , Choyi , Rabai , Ribe , Jibana , Kambe -- want to clear what remains to farm . Worldwide , forests cover 24 % less land than in 1700 . Just between 1980 and 1990 , forests decreased by an area twice the size of Pakistan or Texas , according to Worldwatch . And most tropical forest land cleared now can sustain crops for only a_few years , while species eliminated in the process are gone forever . So the Kenya Museum Society set_out to alter the balance_of_power between humankind and nature by changing attitudes and interaction -- beginning with Arabuko Sokoke ' s butterflies . The goal is &quot; sustainable use of a forest resource that can economically benefit the local community. &quot; Launched last June , the project teaches farming families how to raise 50 butterfly pupae ( the stage between larva and adult ) per month for export , at one dollar per pupa , that amounts to an income supplement ( $ 600 a year ) greater than the country ' s $ 385 per capita annual income . And it is cost-efficient . The museum will receive a one-time grant of $ 50 # 000 from the new joint small-grants program of the United Nations and the World_Bank . After that , the venture will last as long as it can sustain itself through butterfly sales -- a growth market because of foreign interest in entomology . &quot; Ten years ago , development was synonymous with growth , size and quantity . Big dams , resorts or cities were the name of the game , &quot; explained Alicia Barcena , executive_director of the Earth Council . ( The Costa Rica-based body was created by the 1992 , U.N.-sponsored Earth Summit environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro to enact its recommendations. ) &quot; But that model didn ' t work as we thought it would . Poverty , unemployment and other problems are worse than ever . All this happened as we liquidated our natural capital , the environment. &quot; Indeed , a study of 25 World Bank-financed projects in Asia , Africa and Latin_America during the Cold_War found over half had no lasting developmental impact six to 10 years later . Most also could not be sustained without outside funding or expertise . And they didn ' t produce anticipated benefits , said Michael M . Cernea , the bank ' s senior adviser for social_policy . Failure is also reflected in the widening gap between rich and poor , despite billions spent worldwide for development . Farming in Honduras In 1960 , the wealthiest 20 % of the world ' s people accounted_for 70 % of global income . By 1989 their share increased to 83 % . The poorest 20 % , meanwhile , accounted_for only 1.4 % of global income , according to Worldwatch . The El Paraiso project in Honduras reflects another new model to deal with inadequate arable land -- a crisis at the heart of food scarcity . During the Cold_War , China ' s lost arable land alone exceeded an area equal_to crop lands in France , Germany , Denmark and Holland combined -- enough to support 450 million people , or a third of its population , at 1990 grain yields , Worldwatch says . Globally , crop lands damaged between 1950 and 1990 by moderate to extreme soil_erosion total an area equal_to China and India combined . Yet to feed the world ' s projected population , output must triple in the next 50 years , according to the U.N. Development Program . After years of helping Honduran farmers increase crop yields -- a one-dimensional and standard form of aid -- World Neighbors in 1990 adopted an integrated approach that in the spirit of sustainability addresses the links between poverty , population and environmental deterioration . In hands-on workshops in fields or in centers of sun-bleached adobe , El Paraiso trainers cover issues from breast feeding and child nutrition to reading , women ' s rights and velvet_bean crops . Velvet_beans , which can be made into cocoa and brownies , are 40 % protein , a good animal feed and a soil-replenishing crop . New &quot; social scaffolding , &quot; grass-roots co-management , and the use of local traditions to introduce innovations help development last , according to U.N. and World_Bank officials . The only foreigner is the American administrator . &quot; We take a decentralized approach . And we try to work with the people as equals , not as experts , &quot; explained Gregg Biggs , a World Neighbors senior associate . The project is already showing significant results . Migration by poor rural farming families to shanties around the capital began to slow after the project began in 1990 , and some are even starting to return to the countryside . El Paraiso also underscores the extraordinary role of non-government organizations ( NGOs ) in development -- a field once largely the domain of governments in the industrialized West . &quot; The rise of NGOs is enormously important to sustainable development , and it ' s symbolic of a broader shift , &quot; said Jonathan Lash , president of the World Resources Institute and co-chair of the President ' s Council on Sustainable Development . Of course , sustainable development still has a long way to go . &quot; We ' re facing a series of extraordinary challenges of greater magnitude in scope and scale than human_beings have ever had to deal with , &quot; said S . Jacob Scheer of the Natural_Resources Defense Council and author of &quot; One Year after Rio. &quot; &quot; The movement will have to accelerate many times to really deal with the problems. &quot; Only two of the 178 countries in Rio -- the United States and Uganda -- met the November deadline to report on compliance with the U.N. ' s environmental agenda . Despite growing international consensus and new concrete solutions , U.N. officials , economists and ecologists all complain of an &quot; implementation gap. &quot; Limited resources , lack of political will and inadequate technology transfers are among the leading problems , according to Nitin Desai , U.N. undersecretary for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development . &quot; We have to move beyond the point of defining the problems to more action , &quot; he said . And the hundreds of sustainability projects launched since 1990 constitute a small fraction of development worldwide , while limited numbers benefit from their efforts . The Kenyan project aids only 50 families , while El Paraiso serves 2 # 000 Hondurans . In contrast , the United States alone spent $ 11.4 trillion ( in constant 1992 dollars ) on preventing a strategic attack from the East Bloc between 1950 and 1990 . &quot; And if there ' d been an attack , it would have been serious , &quot; Steinbruner said . &quot; But in all probability , the consequences of that would still have been nowhere near as great as triggering an irreversible environmental effect. &quot; Yet among both economists and environmentalists , there is a sense that sustainability is the cutting edge of the future . &quot; Occasionally in human history , you get a shift of perspective that has large cascading implications , &quot; said Steinbruner . &quot; We feel that way about sustainable development. &quot; Availability of Renewable Resources Resources ( except forests ) are expected to increase by 2010 , but not enough to catch_up_with population growth . 06 # 31 , 07 # 07 , 07 # 10 , 08 % change Per Circa 1990- capita 1970 1990 2010 * 2010 change Population ( millions ) 3 # 702 5 # 290 7 # 030 + 33 -- Fish catch ( tons ) * * 66 85 102 + 20 -10 Irrigated land ( hectares ) * * * 168 237 277 + 17 -12 Cropland ( hectares ) 1 # 377 1 # 444 1 # 516 + 5 -21 Rangeland / pasture ( hectares ) 3 # 258 3 # 402 3 # 540 + 4 -22 Forests ( hectares ) 3 # 688 3 # 412 3 # 165 -7 -30 * Projections based on last 10 years . * * Wild catch from fresh and marine waters ( excludes aquaculture ) . * * * Data is from 1961 SOURCE : &quot; State of the World , 1994 , &quot; published by the World Watch Institute COLOR , World Grain Output ( kilograms per person ) 1950 - 2030 Source : U.S. Department_of_Agriculture COLOR , World Fish Catch ( kilograms per person ) 1950 - 2030 Source : U.N.
