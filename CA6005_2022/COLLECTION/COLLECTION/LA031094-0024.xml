   <TEXT> Pity the peanut . It ' s not a pea and it ' s not really a nut . Even so , most people around the world insist on treating it as one or the other . They roast it ( here and there -- in China , parts of Africa and the American South ) or they boil it . When it ' s ground fine enough , though , this oil-rich cousin of the fava_bean shows its real potential . Our national taste for peanut_butter ( See &quot; E Pluribus Chunky , &quot; H10 ) has made_it a basic element in American cookie- , candy- and cake-making . In Latin_America , the Caribbean , Southeast_Asia and Africa , ground peanuts show_up in sauces and stews . The peanut is a South_American original , a shrub whose flowers send tendrils into the ground where they grow_into seed pods . It was domesticated about 4 # 000 years ago in the eastern foothills of the Andes , somewhere around the border between Bolivia and Argentina . And very thoroughly domesticated ; it ' s one of the few plants in the world that is never found in the wild . By the time of Columbus , it had spread throughout Latin_America and the Caribbean . Ground peanuts enter into cooking throughout this area today . In Peru , rich peanut butter-based sauces cover aji de gallina ( a peppery chicken dish ) , papas arequipena ( potatoes in peanut sauce ) and carapulcra ( ditto , with Andean freeze-dried potatoes ) . In Ecuador , cheesy fried potato patties ( llapingachos ) come_in spicy peanut sauce . Bolivian cooks make a chicken_soup with peanut dumplings , sopa de mani . * And so on . The Brazilian dish peixe com molho de amendoim is fish simmered with peanut_butter , spices and chiles . Mexico puts ground peanuts into certain moles and in stews with names like pollo encacahuetado . In the Caribbean , they stew rabbits with peanut sauce . To say nothing about the many Latin_American sweets made with peanuts , or the Caribbean peanut milk cocktail . Europeans first came_across the peanut in Haiti , where the Taino people called it mani ( the Portuguese word amendoim comes from a related Brazilian language ) . Mani became the word for peanut in Colonial Spanish , and that ' s why Bolivians call it by a name imported from Haiti , even when they ' re descended from the people who domesticated the plant in the first place . During the 16th Century the Spanish took the peanut to the Philippines , where it is still called mani . In most of eastern Asia , however , it was the Chinese who spread it . The peanut is known as &quot; Chinese bean &quot; in Japan and Indonesia , and as far away as India , to the Bengalis it ' s chinabadam , &quot; Chinese almond. &quot; The peanut was a big hit in Asia ( today 85 % of the world ' s peanuts are grown in Asia and Africa ) , but in large chunks of that continent the peanut rarely , if ever , winds_up as peanut_butter . The Chinese boil peanuts plain or toss them into stir-fries , but to China the peanut is primarily an oil seed . In fact , Chinese cookery is hard to imagine without the flavor of frying peanut_oil , which is why China is the largest peanut grower in the world today . But Chinese peanut_butter ? Not that you ' d notice . * India also raises peanuts primarily for oil , though the southern part of the country has more interest in them for their own sake . Whole or chopped peanuts show_up in pilafs , salads and tamarind-based sauces in South India . Ground peanuts do play a role in Indian snack_foods , though . For anything like a peanut_butter cuisine , you have to stop halfway between India and China , in Indonesia . One of the most famous Indonesian dishes is satay , little skewers of grilled meat served with mildly spicy sweet-sour sauces made with peanut_butter , chiles , coconut_milk and fish sauce . Satay has spread around Southeast_Asia as far as Sri Lanka , off the southern tip of India . In Indonesia there ' s even a salad ( gado-gado ) with a rich satay-style peanut sauce . Southern Thailand has peanut_butter dishes of its own , such_as pra ram long song ( beef and spinach stewed in something rather like a satay sauce ) and gai thua ( chicken in a peanut_butter and coconut_milk curry ) . But the farther you get from Indonesia , the smaller the role peanuts play . In places like Cambodia and Burma , they go_back to the same sort of role they play in China , getting chopped_up and tossed into soup or salad . It was in Africa that the peanut found its heartiest welcome . The Portuguese brought it to West Africa in the early 1500s , and in 1564 the traveler Alvares de Almada reported it was already an established crop in Senegal and Gambia ( which are still among the world ' s greatest peanut-exporting countries ) . Within 200 years it had spread on its own all_the way across Africa to Angola , without Portuguese help . * This was an amazing speed in the pre-modern age , particularly in Africa , where long-distance travel was difficult . The reason the peanut spread so fast was that the idea of a nut / bean growing underground was not unfamiliar in Africa . There were already a_couple_of indigenous African &quot; groundnuts. &quot; The most important was Voandzeia subterranea , an underground cousin of the cowpea that is one of the tiny handful of food plants the Central African rain_forest and savannah have contributed to the human diet . It was one of the five crops the Bantus had with them 3 # 000 years ago when they began the expansion that eventually made half of sub-Saharan Africa Bantu-speaking . Peanuts and Voandzeia are much alike . They ' re both foot-high shrubs ( peanut leaves comes_in fours , though , while Voandzeia leaves come_in threes ) and they both ripen their &quot; nuts &quot; in underground pods . But Voandzeia has only one largish seed to a pod , and while a peanut is 40 % -50 % oil , Voandzeia is only 8 % oil . Some African nationalities seem to have retained a taste for a less oily groundnut . The Hausas of northern Nigeria often cook with peanut cake , the residue that remains in the press after the oil is squeezed_out of peanuts . The 14th Century Arab traveler Ibn Battuta reported being served a snack of fried Voandzeia paste . The present-day Hausa snack kuli kuli is much the same thing , only these days it ' s made from peanuts with as much of the oil removed as possible . * In short , the peanut apparently spread so widely in Africa because it was able to move_into an existing culinary niche , as shown by the fact that throughout Africa it has taken_over the local names that had formerly been used for Voandzeia . The Hausas , for instance , still often use the same name ( gujiya ) for peanut and Voandzeia . To the Kikongo of Zaire , peanuts are nguba and Voandzeia is nguba zi Kongo , &quot; the groundnut of the Congo. &quot; Voandzeia , being less oily , is harder than the peanut , so in a number of languages it ' s called &quot; hard groundnut. &quot; that ' s what the Swahili word njugumaye means ; the peanut , which the Swahilis got from Malawi ( the former Nyasaland ) , is njugunyasa . From Senegal in West Africa to Tanzania and Mozambique in East Africa , peanuts are added_to stews with meat , onions , tomatoes and chiles . In West Africa , it ' s particularly characteristic to add dried shrimp or fish . ( In Cameroon , though , peanut sauce is served on fresh shrimp. ) In East Africa , vegetables are often stewed with peanut_butter -- spinach or squash in Kenya , cornmeal or beans in Zambia . In southern Nigeria , the Ijaw people smoke some of their peanuts , drying them on racks over a smoking fire . In northern Nigeria , the Hausas stew_meat with chiles and onions in the usual way , and they also coat skewered meat ( tsire ) with peanut cake and ginger , more or less making satay with the sauce cooked right on . They make a sort of jerky ( kilishi ) by coating meat with peanut cake and spices and drying it in the sun . It ' s well known that peanuts accompanied African slaves to the New World ; the old American name goober clearly comes from one of the Congolese languages that use the word nguba . So it shouldn ' t be surprising that the African habit of stewing_meat with peanut_butter , tomatoes , onions and chiles found its way to the Caribbean . * But what a pity -- there were some places the peanut just couldn ' t spread . Cool climates , for instance , because the peanut needs warmth . It also needs a fair amount of water during its summer growing season , which effectively rules it out for most of the Mediterranean . In the Arab world , peanuts are known only as a sidewalk snack -- peanut-growing entrepreneurs from the Sudan roast them on street_corners , the same way chestnuts are roasted in this country . As a result , the Arabs call peanuts Sudan beans , or Sudan pistachios . But what would have happened if the Near_East had been a suitable environment for growing peanuts ? Would peanut_butter have replaced sesame tahineh ? Would we be eating hummus made with peanut_butter ? we ' ll never know . It might have been the greatest thing since satay . * The word &quot; nyeleng &quot; comes from the Mandinka language of West Africa , but the Mandinkas ' peanut-farming neighbors , the Wolof people of Senegal , now make this dish as well . Jamaica ( pronounced hah-MY-kah ) is the Spanish name for the dried blossoms of an African shrub , Hibiscus_sabdariffa . It is sold in Latin markets and many supermarkets under the name of jamaica , but you can also find it in Caribbean markets ( as sorrel ) and Near Eastern import stores ( as karkadeh ) . Though it ' s best known in this country as an herbal_tea -- it ' s what makes teas such_as Red Zinger tart and red -- in Africa this hibiscus is often used in cooking . For that matter , okra is also an African hibiscus . BEEF AND PEANUT GUMBO ( Nyeleng ) 2 pounds beef , cut_in pieces 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons ground dried shrimp 6 cups water 2 pounds okra , sliced 1 cup minus 1 tablespoon chunky style peanut_butter 1 cup jamaica flowers 1 onion 2 chiles , not seeded Steamed millet or cornmeal_mush Place beef in pot .

In this case , there ' s a sweet leavening of cilantro as well . The traditional peanut sauce that goes_with them tastes so_much like a Southeast Asian sauce ( just add a little coconut_milk and fish sauce and you ' d be there ) that the dish becomes something like an extremely rich vegetarian satay . From &quot; South_American Cooking &quot; by Barbara Karoff . CHEESE AND POTATO PATTIES WITH PEANUT SAUCE ( Llapingachos ) 2 pounds russet potatoes , peeled and cut_in half Salt , pepper Butter 1 large onion , minced 1 / 2 cup minced cilantro 1 / 4 pound Muenster cheese Salsa de Mani In pot cover potatoes with cold water and bring_to boil .

Add onion and saute 2 minutes . Add jalapeno and tomato and cook until sauce becomes mushy . Add peanut_butter and mix well . Remove from heat and slowly add water to make pourable consistency . Season to taste with salt and pepper . * On paper , this Caribbean recipe looks_like one of the usual West_African peanut butter-flavored stews , except that it contains no tomatoes or greens . Amazingly , however , the effect is quite French , as if somebody had substituted peanut_butter for the mushrooms in a cream-enriched sauce champignon ( and added a dose of hot_pepper ) . In &quot; The Complete Book of Caribbean Cooking , &quot; Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz credits the recipe to the former British Leeward Islands -- now the independent nations of St . Kitts , Nevis , Antigua_and_Barbuda -- but we note that they ' re pretty close to Guadeloupe , which is so French it actually votes_in the_French parliament . CARIBBEAN RABBIT AND GROUNDNUT STEW 2 ounces salt_pork , cubed 2 1 / 2 pounds rabbit , cleaned and cut_into serving pieces 1 onion , chopped 1 clove garlic , chopped 2 cups chicken_stock 1 bay_leaf 1 / 4 teaspoon ground thyme 1 / 4 teaspoon ground marjoram Parsley Salt , pepper 2 serrano chiles 1 / 2 cup peanut_butter 1 / 4 teaspoon ground nutmeg Hot pepper_sauce In heavy pot , melt salt_pork . Remove crackling and brown rabbit pieces in melted fat . Add onion and garlic and saute until tender . Add stock , bay_leaf , thyme , marjoram , parsley and salt and pepper to taste . Cover and cook at low heat until rabbit is tender , about 1 hour . Ladle off 2 cups cooking liquid . Place 1 cup in blender or food_processor with chiles , peanut_butter and nutmeg . Process until smooth . Put second cup cooking liquid in saucepan with peanut_butter mixture and simmer gently 15 minutes . Adjust seasonings to taste . Add rabbit pieces and simmer on very low heat just long enough to heat meat through . Serve with rice and pass hot_pepper sauce . Makes 4 to 6 servings . Each of 4 servings contains about : 573 calories ; 891 mg sodium ; 110 mg cholesterol ; 38 grams fat ; 13 grams carbohydrates ; 46 grams protein ; 1.46 grams fiber . * This very rich Mexican candy is something like a giant peanut_butter cup made with dark chocolate and slightly grainy , freshly ground peanuts . As the name indicates , it is a Mexican adaptation of marzipan , substituting peanuts for ground_almonds . CHOCOLATE-COVERED PEANUT PATTIES ( Mazapan ) 4 cups unsalted roasted peanuts 1 cup sugar 6 ounces semisweet or bittersweet_chocolate Grind peanuts fine in food_processor . Add sugar and process into compact paste . Divide into 12 equal pieces . In 2 1 / 2-inch-diameter ramekin , mold each piece into thick disk . Remove disks from mold carefully . Melt chocolate in double_boiler and keep warm . Spoon 1 generous tablespoon melted chocolate onto wax_paper . Carefully place 1 peanut disk on top and move_around to cover entire bottom of disk with chocolate . Then enrobe top and sides with melted chocolate . Repeat process to enrobe remaining disks . Place candies , still on wax_paper , in refrigerator until ready to serve . Makes 12 candies . Each serving contains about : 424 calories ; 3 mg sodium ; trace cholesterol ; 28 grams fat ; 36 grams carbohydrates ; 13 grams protein ; 2.48 grams fiber . * The United States gets the last word with two peanut_butter cookies developed by The Times Test Kitchen staff .

Mart . A Discouraging Word It ' s true , as George_Washington Carver emphasized , that pound for pound peanuts contain more vitamins , proteins and minerals than beef liver . However , They also contain more fat . The average eating peanut is about 40 % oil .</TEXT>
