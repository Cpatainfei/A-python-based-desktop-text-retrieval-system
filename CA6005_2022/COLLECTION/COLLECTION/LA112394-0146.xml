   <HEADLINE> POLITICS ; GOP ' S 10-POINT PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Republican agenda in the next Congress , laid_out by more_than 300 House candidates in their pre-election &quot; Contract with America , &quot; promises sweeping tax and social reforms in the first 100 days of the new legislative session starting in January . But not all Republicans support all_the provisions in the 10-point contract , which Democrats have attacked as an &quot; extremist &quot; attempt to take this country back to the supply-side_economics of the Reagan era . Here is a point-by-point look_at the contract , along with some perspective on the legislative prospects : 1 ) Balanced_budget : A constitutional amendment to require the federal budget to be balanced by 2002 or within seven years of enactment , whichever comes later . The amendment also would require a three-fifths vote_in the House and Senate to approve any future tax increases and allow the balanced-budget requirement to be waived in times of war or by three-fifths vote by both houses of Congress . Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act , the President would also receive the line-item veto -- the authority to veto individual items in a spending bill without rejecting the whole measure . Outlook : Likely to pass . Attempts to pass a balanced-budget amendment failed narrowly in the last Congress , and the large influx of new Republicans is likely to tip the balance in favor of passage by the required two-thirds majority . President Clinton has opposed it , but his veto authority does not extend_to constitutional amendments . However , it would still have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states . 2 ) Crime control : Republicans opposed much of the social spending and gun_control provisions in the Democratic crime bill that passed_by narrow margins earlier this year . Starting in January , they plan to amend it with the so-called Taking Back Our Streets Act , an anti-crime package that would add new mandatory minimum sentences , toughen the death_penalty provisions and put more money into prison construction by stripping funds for crime prevention programs , like midnight basketball_leagues . Outlook : Democrats will oppose many of the provisions but may_not have the votes to block them because of the public outcry over crime . Clinton could veto any extensive rewrite of his crime bill , but congressional sources say it is unclear if the White_House will pick this issue on which to confront the new Republican majority . 3 ) Welfare reform : The GOP ' s Personal Responsibility Act would ban welfare benefits to unwed mothers younger than 18 as a means of discouraging out-of-wedlock births and teen-age pregnancy . It would also cut_off assistance after two years to families covered under the main federal-state welfare program , Aid to Families With Dependent Children , and require welfare recipients to report the identity of a child ' s father before receiving benefits . The growth of other programs would be capped . Outlook : Cloudy at best . While some type of welfare reform seems inevitable next year , Republican moderates in the House and Senate may join Democrats in opposing some of the GOP proposals as too Draconian . Several committees will weigh into the debate and , in the end , look_for something between the GOP bill and Clinton ' s proposal to require young mothers to work after two years of receiving AFDC . 4 ) Education and children : A hodgepodge of &quot; family values &quot; provisions , the Family Reinforcement Act would establish school voucher programs , set_up a nationwide tracking system to find parents who fail to make child_support payments , strengthen child pornography laws and provide a tax_credit for people who care_for elderly relatives . Outlook : Most of the provisions are likely to pass , but school vouchers to give parents the choice of sending their children to public or private_schools may run_into obstacles from some Republicans as well as Democrats . 5 ) Middle-class tax cut : The Republican version would establish a $ 500-per-child tax_credit for families earning under $ 200 # 000 per year , create another tax_credit to offset the so-called marriage penalty and allow individuals to open IRA accounts bearing tax-free interest upon withdrawal . Outlook : Some form of middle-class tax cut is clearly in the offing , but specific contract proposals are expected to come under scrutiny by budget_deficit hawks in the Senate . 6 ) National security : The proposal calls_for increased defense spending and legislation to prohibit U.S. troops from serving under United Nations or other foreign command . Outlook : Rough sledding . The prohibition on the foreign command of U.S. troops enjoys widespread support , but Republicans on the Armed Services committees are expected to object , agreeing with the Administration that it infringes on the President ' s powers as commander_in_chief . Deficit hawks also note that the contract does not say how Republicans would pay_for higher defense spending without ballooning the deficit . 7 ) Senior_citizens : Several tax cuts are proposed for senior_citizens , along with raising the Social_Security earnings limit and helping the elderly pay_for long-term care by allowing them to make tax-free withdrawals from IRAs or 401 ( k ) accounts to pay_for long-term care insurance . Outlook : Some kind of tax relief for seniors appears likely but , again , the specific proposals are likely to run_into opposition from Democrats and some Senate Republicans because of their weight on the budget burden . 8 ) Capital_gains tax cut : The GOP proposes to halve the capital_gains tax and adjust the purchase_price of an asset for inflation , thus reducing the taxable capital_gain at the time of sale . Outlook : Unclear . Republicans in both the House and Senate support a capital_gains tax cut , but Democrats deride the proposal , which could raise the deficit by $ 56 billion over five years , as a break for the wealthy . The White_House strongly opposes it , and small business groups are also skeptical . 9 ) Legal reform : Tort reform to set limits on punitive damages in product liability and medical malpractice lawsuits is proposed , as well as a &quot; loser pays &quot; provision to allow judges to order the losers in lawsuits to pay the other side ' s legal costs . Outlook : Dicey . Efforts to discourage runaway litigation and protect the health industry in particular from exorbitant costs are popular , but these specific provisions will have the nation ' s trial_lawyers and consumer groups lined_up against them . Democrats also argue that the &quot; loser pays &quot; proposal would discourage all but the very wealthy from going_to court . If it passes , a Clinton veto is likely . 10 ) Congressional term limits : A constitutional amendment to limit federal lawmakers ' terms_of_office to 12 years , or two terms , in the Senate and six to 12 years in the House , depending_on which version is adopted . Outlook : Don ' t hold your breath . Term limits are extremely popular_with voters , making them difficult to vote against , even though most lawmakers loathe them . But passage is still considered uncertain in the House and doubtful in the Senate , especially in_view of the two-thirds majority requirement for amendments . Michael Ross , Times Staff Writer</TEXT>
