   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : COUNTY ISSUE : OIL_PIPELINE REGULATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the wake of major oil spills that fouled the ecologically sensitive Santa Clara River and the wetlands along McGrath Lake in Ventura County , Assemblyman Jack O ' Connell ( D-Carpinteria ) is proposing strict new regulations for oil_pipelines . Are such regulations needed , and will they prevent future spills ? * Alan Godley Environmentalist , owner of Blue Dolphin environmental store in Ventura Something needs to be done to protect these very sensitive areas . The steelhead that depend_on the Santa Clara River , for instance , are in such a stressed state that they can ' t rebound if a spill occurs and are vulnerable to extinction . At the very least , we should have maps of where the new and old pipelines are , so we know where they cross sensitive habitat . It ' s those pipelines that should be regularly monitored . If an earthquake occurs , crews should be out there immediately looking_for cracks , just as crews check bridges and highway overpasses . In the case of the Christmas ( Eve ) spill ( at McGrath Lake ) , there was human error involved , too . It took almost five days before anyone even knew there was a leak . We should make every effort to prevent such mistakes through more frequent monitoring . We should know if a pipeline is too old and stressed . I don ' t know how long pipelines can be used safely ; it ' s not my industry , but I know they corrode over time . There should be some sort of standard set stating when pipelines should be replaced . I know they can ' t carry oil forever without breaking . * Terry Covington Western States Petroleum Assn . in Santa Barbara * We at Western States Petroleum believe a call_for new regulations at this point_in_time is premature . It is not clear that additional regulations imposed on all companies across-the-board is necessary . It is also not clear that it would provide any additional benefit or could have prevented these incidents . It is important to note that this ( the Santa Clara spill ) was the only pipeline break from the devastating earthquake in the whole area . The most important effort now should be to determine what caused the spills and what corrective action is necessary . Once this information is obtained , it will be useful to the regulatory_agencies who oversee our onshore activities as well as the companies that have onshore operations . The review being conducted by state agencies to examine current preventive inspection and maintenance and response measures in our opinion is the most constructive response . Perhaps the role of the Legislature should be to oversee communication and notification procedures among existing state and local agencies . * John K . Flynn Ventura County supervisor * The oil spills were a tragedy , but I think there is a tendency to overreact after accidents like these . We could have legislation left and right that would cost taxpayers lots of money and not really do much . I would rather take a careful approach on this . We have a system that works 99 % of the time . It didn ' t work well during the Christmas ( Eve ) spill , and maybe we should have better monitoring of pipelines in sensitive areas , but I would hope that the state would consult with industry and local officials before they enact any new legislation . Ventura is laced with pipelines , and accidents are bound to happen . What seems most important is that we don ' t have the miscommunication between the various agencies that we had during the ( McGrath Lake ) spill . No one seemed to know who was in_charge . We can ' t have that , but we should be cautious in pushing for more government regulation . * Jack O ' Connell Assemblyman ( D-Carpinteria ) * As always , my primary concern is that we prevent the kind of tragic spill I saw at McGrath Lake . The one thing that became clear after the McGrath incident is that no one knows how many old pipes are out there ready to rupture . The fact that it took days to notice and react to the pipeline break also underscores a critical and immediate need for increased site monitoring and significant retraining in appropriate notification procedures . The Department of Fish and Game ' s Oil Spill Prevention and Response team is compiling a comprehensive inventory of the number and type of pipelines , especially those along our fragile coastline . As this issue continues to develop and as our questions get answered , I will be moving forward with legislation designed to address construction and inspection standards that will tangibly increase pipeline spill prevention efforts . * Andy Prokopow Secretary for the Ventura County Environmental Coalition and a civil_engineer * There are hundreds of miles of pipeline out there , and more are being added all_the time . The oil_companies don ' t want to make the capital investments to modernize all that older equipment even though it ' s in their best interest . It ' s like the arguments over double-lined tankers : Instead of justifying the expense , they ' re looking_at a bell curve that says the probability of a major break is very low . The earthquake alone should justify precautions . Accidents and disasters happen . We should take action to make those pipelines as safe as they can be , including regular monitoring . We should make_sure that if a break occurs , it doesn ' t dump into sensitive areas like the Santa Clara River . that ' s probably one of the most sensitive areas in the county . We don ' t want to lose_it . Right now , we rely_on the oil_companies to monitor themselves . It ' s the old fox guarding the chicken_coop . I don ' t know if new regulations will stop spills altogether , but it would be a move_in that direction .</TEXT>
