   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER ' 94 : 16 DAYS OF GLORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It takes nearly one hour for Bud Greenspan ' s &quot; Lillehammer ' 94 : 16 Days of Glory &quot; to get glorious . When it does , hardly anyone can keep a dry eye . Greenspan , who has chronicled the Olympics for 40 years , put_together a two-part film memory of the Lillehammer Games . The first portion will air Sunday night on The Disney Channel , with the second part scheduled for next Feb . 12 . The first two hours are dedicated to ski_jumping , figure_skating , cross-country_skiing and speed skating . More specifically , the spotlight is turned_on gold medalists Jens Weissflog and Espen Bredesen in the opening segment , followed by Oksana Baiul , then Manuela Di Centa and Lyubov Egorova . But the film doesn ' t really get moving until the focus turns_to Dan Jansen . &quot; His emotion , his honesty convinced me to pursue his story in_depth , &quot; said Greenspan , who at first was reluctant to make Jansen ' s saga a central part of the film . &quot; He was so real , so expressive , that I realized I had to tell his story -- through his eyes . He tells it so poignantly , so beautifully. &quot; Jansen ' s story of repeated Olympic disappointment and related tragedy finally leading to triumph is as moving_in &quot; 16 Days of Glory &quot; as it was when it was winning his gold medal . Wisely , Greenspan tells the entire story , going_back to 1984 at Sarajevo , when Jansen was a surprise fourth after expecting nothing more_than a top 15 finish . In 1988 , of course , Jansen fell twice as a favorite , but with the most valid of excuses : His sister , Jane , died of leukemia the morning of his first Olympic race at Calgary . The film allows Jansen ' s words and actions to tell the story . Four years later , at Albertville , Jansen was victimized by slow tracks and , perhaps , being over-prepared . So he came_to Lillehammer , his final Olympics , as one of the biggest busts in Winter_Olympics history . And then he failed again , finishing eighth in the 500 , a race he had dominated during the World Cup season . &quot; This was my race , &quot; he said . Greenspan ' s cameras often focus_on Jansen ' s wife , Robin , and his daughter , Jane , named after his sister . Robin provides an insightful analysis of Jansen ' s 500 race , as well as relating her husband ' s thoughts through four Olympics . Dan Jansen then admits his fear of the 1 # 000 and relates how a sports psychologist helped him overcome it . As for a gold medal , however , &quot; I sort of was prepared that it just wasn ' t going_to happen. &quot; When it did , America celebrated , and &quot; 16 Days of Glory &quot; captures the emotions superbly , particularly when Jansen reflects on his past from the medals podium during the playing of the &quot; Star Spangled Banner. &quot; He narrates his thoughts at that moment : &quot; My whole career , to my family , Robin , even to my daughter , Jane , &quot; he said . &quot; And to my sister , Jane , very much so. &quot; Then Jansen looks_up and salutes his sister before taking the victory lap with baby Jane in his arms . Unfortunately , much of Greenspan ' s film doesn ' t come_close to that level of drama and emotion . The cross-country segment featuring Di Centa of Italy and Egorova of Russia is too long . The footage of the ski_jumping is spectacular , but the interviews with Weissflog and Bredesen fall_flat . To his credit , Greenspan focused_on Baiul rather than the Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding mess in the figure_skating . &quot; She was the real story of the figure_skating , &quot; he said of the Ukrainian orphan , who won the gold medal at 16 . &quot; Harding and Kerrigan was not an inspirational story . It had nothing to do with the beauty and the spirit of the competition . It was ludicrous that all people talked_about was Tonya and Nancy. &quot; Unfortunately , there is little inspired storytelling in the segment on Baiul , or the other three . But the Jansen stuff makes_up for it . The second part of &quot; 16 Hours of Glory &quot; will focus_on skaters Bonnie Blair and Johann Olav Koss , skiers Alberto Tomba and Vladimir Smirnoff , bobsledders Wolfgang Hoppe and Prince Albert of Monaco and the thrilling men ' s 4x10 kilometer cross-country relay_race .</TEXT>
