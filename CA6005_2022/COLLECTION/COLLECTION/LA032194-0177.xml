   <HEADLINE> KEY DISCOVERY BOOSTS IMAGE OF AGOURON ; BIOTECHNOLOGY : LA JOLLA PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY ZEROING IN ON CURE FOR THE COMMON_COLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s the kind of scientific breakthrough biotechnology companies dream about : a discovery that could lead to the development of a drug for treating the common_cold . Agouron Pharmaceuticals ' announcement March 11 that it had discovered the structure of an enzyme critical to reproduction of viruses that frequently cause colds boosted its profile on Wall_Street . The research breakthrough was one of a series of successes that have driven_up Agouron ' s market_value 21.3 % since Dec . 31 . The company ' s stock closed at $ 14.25 in Friday ' s trading on Nasdaq . The discovery does not ensure that Agouron will develop an effective cold-fighting drug -- that won ' t be known for several years at least . Still , the prospect of having a blockbuster in_sight has created lots of excitement at the company , whose researchers are also working_on treatments to combat AIDS , cancer and other diseases . &quot; There is a very strong and exhilarating sensation that the technology . . . we set_out to develop a decade ago is beginning to boil to the surface in some dramatic ways , &quot; said Peter Johnson , Agouron ' s president and chief_executive . The discovery is &quot; potentially very important , &quot; said Jim McCamant , the Berkeley-based editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter . &quot; One of the intriguing things is that it provides the promise of a solution to a medical problem that has been insolvable. &quot; Another analyst who likes Agouron , Ed Hurwitz of Smith Barney Shearson in San Francisco , recently wrote that it is &quot; one of the most undervalued and overlooked companies in the biotechnology industry. &quot; That is high praise for a company without a drug on the market and none nearing Food and Drug Administration approval . But industry observers say Agouron ' s recent announcement is all_the more impressive because it follows several recent successes in research and corporate strategy . Last month , Agouron announced a key financing agreement with the pharmaceutical division of Japan Tobacco Inc. under which it would double its maximum investment in Agouron to more_than $ 56 million , provided certain research milestones are met . Japan Tobacco , which already owns 2 % of the firm , is a diversified company based in Japan with $ 23 billion in annual revenue . The agreement will provide funding for research on drugs to treat and prevent common upper respiratory infections , hepatitis C and herpes . Japan Tobacco will gain exclusive marketing rights to the drugs in Japan , Taiwan and South_Korea . Significantly , however , Agouron retained exclusive worldwide marketing rights to the anti-rhinoviral drugs -- those for treating colds and other upper respiratory ailments . The La Jolla-based firm was also able to negotiate a highly favorable deal with research partner Eli Lilly late last year involving drugs for fighting HIV , the AIDS virus . Lilly handed_over to Agouron all worldwide commercial rights to its anti-HIV drugs in exchange for receiving proprietary details of Agouron ' s recent discovery related to the common_cold . The deal means that the much larger Lilly will become a competitor of Agouron in the race to develop a treatment for colds and other respiratory ailments . Nevertheless , Johnson said he was delighted by the agreement . &quot; While we don ' t underestimate Lilly , &quot; he said , &quot; we have a great_deal of expertise and are quite comfortable with our ability to compete successfully. ' The agreements with Japan Tobacco and Lilly are significant because they enable Agouron to reap broader commercial benefits -- that is , profit -- if it can bring new drugs to market . More commonly , young biotechnology firms sacrifice commercial rights to their partners , usually big drug_companies , in exchange for financing or research assistance . Agouron is considered one of the leaders in developing a new class of AIDS drugs known as protease inhibitors , which aim to stop HIV from producing an enzyme key to its replication . &quot; We believe they are the most potent anti-HIV agents in the world , &quot; Johnson said . Possibly , but the drugs haven ' t yet been tested on humans . The company hopes to begin first-phase clinical trials -- the first of several steps to drug approval , dealing only with safety and dosage -- later this year . Drug maker Hoffman-La Roche recently began the first large-scale human studies of a protease inhibitor for use against HIV . Further along in development are several anti-cancer drugs , which are just completing first-phase trials in the United States and Europe . In a separate project , Agouron is working with pharmaceutical giant Schering-Plough Corp . on another cancer-related research project . To be sure , Agouron ' s drug development process has not always worked . In mid-1993 , the company suspended development of an anti-psoriasis therapy after it proved ineffective in human clinical studies . The psoriasis treatment worked in a similar manner to attack the skin disorder as do Agouron ' s cancer_drugs . But company officials say they remain confident that the anti-cancer drugs can be effective . Agouron ' s discovery of the structure of the cold-related enzyme , rhinovirus 3C protease , involved a highly sophisticated technique known as X-ray crystallography . The company said the discovery enables researchers to prepare an atom-by-atom design of a drug that would block the enzyme and inhibit replication of the virus . Initially , drug development would be targeted at treating infections in patients with chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_diseases , such_as emphysema and chronic_bronchitis , which afflict about 13.8 million Americans . But Johnson said the drug might also be used to prevent infections in people exposed to a cold virus and to relieve or eliminate symptoms more quickly . As an asthma sufferer , he said , he personally looks_forward to such a drug . &quot; For me , a heavy cold can give me bronchial_asthma , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; It can knock me out of the box for two to three weeks , and I have children. &quot; Johnson said he has fielded a flurry of phone_calls about the recent discovery and has been pleased by the response . &quot; We ' ve had very few people who have called and said , ' I understand you ' ve cured the common cold. ' People understand it was an important step_in that direction , but there is a good_deal of work that lies ahead. &quot;</TEXT>
