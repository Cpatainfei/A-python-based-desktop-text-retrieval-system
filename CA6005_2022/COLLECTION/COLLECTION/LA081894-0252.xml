   <HEADLINE> SOUTHLAND COMPUTER MAKERS MAY LABEL KEYBOARDS ; CONSUMERS : SOME FIRMS ARE CONSIDERING THE MOVE TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY FROM REPETITIVE STRESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Compaq Computer Corp. ' s announcement that it will put labels on its keyboards warning of possible hand and wrist injuries has prompted manufacturers and distributors in Southern California to weigh whether they should follow Compaq ' s lead . Facing a growing number of product liability lawsuits linked to the use of computers , some companies that make and sell keyboards said Wednesday that they are studying ways to call customers ' attention to the potential for injury from repetitive stress . &quot; When keyboards first came_out , we weren ' t aware of carpal_tunnel_syndrome , &quot; a painful wrist condition , said Rebecca Cradick , a spokeswoman for Toshiba America Inc. ' s Information_Systems Division in Irvine . &quot; Now that it ' s out there , we ' d want to warn ( customers ) about it. &quot; Though there is no nationwide tally of liability suits involving computers , the number is growing , said Robert Komitor , a partner at Levi , Phillips &amp; Konigsberg in New York . His firm represents about 1 # 000 plaintiffs who say they have keyboard-related injuries . The suits are divided among about 100 manufacturers nationwide , Komitor said . Among corporations involved in such litigation is AST Research Inc. , the country ' s fifth-largest maker of personal_computers . AST , based in Irvine , stated in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April that it faced 11 lawsuits alleging that its products caused carpal_tunnel_syndrome or other repetitive stress injuries . An AST spokesman said Wednesday that it cannot comment on the issue while lawsuits are pending except to say that it is aware of Compaq ' s action . Compaq , the leading seller of personal_computers , said Tuesday that it will begin putting this notice on its keyboards : &quot; Warning ! To Reduce Risk of Serious Injury to Hands , Wrists or Other Joints , Read Safety &amp; Comfort Guide. &quot; Microsoft Corp . also said it will place notices on some of its keyboards . * &quot; Compaq is a very prudent firm , &quot; said William J . Milton , an analyst who follows computer companies for the brokerage Brown Bros . Harriman in New York . &quot; I could see where others would follow because they have nothing to lose. &quot; Milton said he doubts that warning labels will affect the sales of Compaq or any other computer maker . &quot; We simply can ' t do without these machines , &quot; he said . A spokeswoman for Toshiba said Wednesday that the company might begin including with its notebook_computers &quot; usage manuals &quot; covering topics such_as proper posture and hand and wrist positions when using the computers . Other companies , however , have no plan_of_action yet . Advanced Logic Research Inc. , a computer manufacturer based in Irvine , said it does not face any keyboard liability lawsuits and doesn ' t anticipate doing anything to head them off . Most of the liability suits filed against manufacturers are unfair , said Dave Kirkey , the company ' s vice_president for_sales and marketing . &quot; I can ' t tell you how to keep that keyboard on your desk or how you should sit or at what distance from the keyboard you should sit , &quot; Kirkey said . James Capretz , a Newport Beach lawyer who has handled a number of product liability cases , said that although warning labels and manuals are no guarantee against lawsuits , they might help in defending such a case . &quot; If you ' re warned of a danger for a product , then the standard ( defense ) is , ' You should have known , ' &quot; said Capretz , who was involved in winning a $ 26-million settlement for recipients of potentially fatal artificial_heart valves manufactured by Shiley Inc. in Irvine . UCLA law professor Gary Schwartz said that merely putting a warning label on a product &quot; doesn ' t relieve the manufacturer of the responsibility of having a safe design. &quot;</TEXT>
