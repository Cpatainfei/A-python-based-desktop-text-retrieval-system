   <HEADLINE> RISE IN TURTLE DEATHS MAY BE GOOD SIGN -- OR A BAD ONE ; TEXAS : MARINE BIOLOGISTS SEE A JUMP IN STRANDINGS ALONG THE STATE ' S COASTLINE . IT COULD MEAN THERE ARE MORE SEA_TURTLES NOW , OR IT COULD MEAN MORE ARE DYING IN NETS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Marine biologists say a drastic jump in the number of sea_turtles washing_up on Texas beaches this past year reflects both good and bad trends in conservation efforts . More_than 500 sea_turtles , about half of them endangered Kemp ' s ridleys , have washed ashore so far in 1994 , far more_than any year in the past decade . David Owens , a marine biologist at Texas A &amp; M University , said the increase is caused partially by successful efforts to bolster turtle populations . But increasing numbers of Gulf_of_Mexico shrimpers apparently are ignoring use of a federally required device to eject turtles from nets . &quot; The good news is the appearance that there may be some success in the ( conservation ) efforts , &quot; said Owens , who has spent 20 years studying sea_turtles . &quot; The bad news is if we don ' t increase the care with which we use turtle excluder devices , it ' s going_to be for naught. &quot; Donna Shaver , the Texas Department of Parks &amp; Wildlife biologist in_charge of a state network for tracking sea_turtle deaths , said 506 stranded sea_turtles had washed_up on Texas shores this year as of Nov . 29 . That total already is nearly triple last year ' s 185 . The highest previous annual total over the past decade was 355 in 1990 . More_than 253 Kemp ' s ridleys , including 27 of the roughly 580 adult_females known to exist , were among those that washed ashore this year , Shaver said . Another 120 or so Kemp ' s ridleys have washed_up in Louisiana this year . Female Kemp ' s ridleys lay their eggs_on beaches in Rancho Nuevo , Mexico , just south of the Texas border . The imperiled species neared extinction in the mid-1980s because of egg-eating natural predators and nest-raiding poachers . The adult_female population dipped below 200 at one point . An aggressive conservation plan on both sides of the border has included teams of volunteers rounding_up the eggs and moving them to protected beach areas . Shrimpers have also been required to install the turtle excluder devices , known as TEDs , which allow turtles to escape nets through a hole . The efforts have paid_off , with the adult_female population tripling . Shaver said no one knows how many Kemp ' s ridleys exist , but their overall population is certain to have gone_up along with the nesting females . Shaver was alarmed , however , by the drastic jump in stranded turtles in Texas this year . Some of the increase probably is caused by conservation efforts , but most of it is because shrimpers aren ' t using TEDs or use them improperly , she said . Shrimpers complain that the devices reduce their catches . &quot; A very large proportion of the turtles stranded this year were stranded as a result of being caught in shrimp nets , &quot; Shaver said from her office on South Padre Island . &quot; The population doesn ' t go_up 2 1 / 2 times in one year. &quot; The shrimping industry claims that the vast majority of the state ' s 4 # 500 licensed trawlers use TEDs . Owens , however , said even a small number of lawbreakers could offset conservation gains . He said he and other marine biologists in Texas are working_on suggestions for persuading more shrimpers to comply with the law . He favors education over increased enforcement . &quot; I believe_in education because I believe shrimpers have a vested_interest in_using those things right , &quot; Owens said , adding that TEDs eject such creatures as sharks and stingrays from nets . &quot; Plus it ' s in their own best interest to get the government off their back. &quot; Scott Smullen , a National Marine Fisheries Service spokesman in Washington , said nearly all shrimpers are believed to be using the devices . Some , however , have sewn the devices shut or are using them at the wrong angles either out of ignorance or to skirt the law , he added . He said the agency , which works with the U.S. Coast Guard to inspect trawlers , is planning ways to improve oversight and educate shrimpers .</TEXT>
