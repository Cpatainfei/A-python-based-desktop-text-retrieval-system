   <TEXT> If it comes as a bit of a shock to self-proclaimed bombshell Erica Jong to walk into a room and suddenly find that she is no longer the &quot; youngest &quot; or the &quot; cutest &quot; there , she certainly has our sympathy . Yes , these things can happen , to the blessed , the talented , even to the thinking person . Then again , superstars have always found ways to cope_with the dismaying process known as aging . For the desperate , there is always cosmetic_surgery , the spa , an athletic trainer , a special diet ; others , alas , like Marilyn Monroe , may resort_to an even more radical solution . Jong ' s current title harks back to her first , fearless smash in 1973 , &quot; Fear of Flying , &quot; in which she coined an unquotable phrase about a &quot; zipless &quot; form of pleasuring she designated as the &quot; symbol of my generation ' s hunger for female freedom through sexual freedom. &quot; As for her latest , &quot; Fear of Fifty , &quot; she has appended to it the subtitle , &quot; A Midlife Memoir , &quot; thus protecting the book from the rather specific rules governing autobiography ; namely , that one must begin at the beginning , &quot; I was born in . . . , &quot; and progress from there . That explains why , from the outset , one is met by Jong ' s faux-naive reaction to the closing of her fifth decade of life -- her discovery of gradual decay in the carnal self . It would seem , Mr. De Mille , that she does not exactly relish her next close-up . Though she willingly admits she &quot; will never be Madonna or Tina Brown or Julia Roberts , &quot; she regrets much more that by the time this book comes_out she will no longer even be considered for &quot; the flavor of the month. &quot; Apparently the statistics get her down : &quot; Every year another crop of beauties assaults me on the streets of New York . With thinner waists and blonder hair and straighter teeth , with more energy to compete ( and less cynicism about the world ) , the class of 1994 , or 1984 , 1974 , is inexorably replacing my class Barnard ' 63 -- yikes ! &quot; So her real trouble is that her attitude to turning 50 resembles the ingenue stance of her salad days . For about 20 years now , since her first novel , the feisty , competitive , foulmouthed , confessional shtick has worked admirably for this writer ; it carried her to fame and fortune . Why not shoot into midlife on the same wave ? The trick might just have worked too , at least as fiction -- a midlife heroine ' s outrageous romp around ( gulp ! ) the clock . But , when it comes_to autobiography ( good autobiography at least ) , there are , unfortunately , some essential requisites . First off , autobiography needs more from a confessor than her simply being &quot; famous for being famous , &quot; as the historian , Daniel Boorstin has phrased it . Then again , the genre inevitably invites comparisons with superior minds . We need to know , for example , why the detailed , intimate recitation of a certain woman ' s life might engage ? And why at this time ? Will it reveal insights into her special genius , her achievement in the literary art ? One is reminded of the late Anthony Burgess ' story of his early life , &quot; Big Wilson and Little God , &quot; or Mary McCarthy ' s &quot; Memoirs of a Catholic Girlhood , &quot; two memorable voices , both for their evocation of their artistic careers and their honesty about their own petty failings . Jong ' s tale clearly does not avoid the latter . Indeed , hers is a remarkable candor ; nor can she be faulted for not telling all . The question is : Does she exhibit more_than we really care to see ? With Burgess or McCarthy , we welcome the revelation of gaping faults behind their brilliant constructs and imaginative creations because they teach us what their humanity is like . But Jong ' s confessionals , on the contrary , appear more like a preemptive strike against oblivion . Not that there aren ' t some lively reminiscences to be found in &quot; Fear of Fifty. &quot; Several of Jong ' s takes -- for example , her tender recollections of her Bohemian Jewish family , her relationships with her sisters and grandparents , her indulged Manhattan childhood , her delicate first loves -- are touching , and seem true_to her notion of herself . In such chapters as &quot; The Mad Lesbian in the Attic , &quot; about her old aunt ' s desertion by her lover of 30 years as she succumbed to dementia and Alzheimer ' s , and &quot; Baby , Baby , Baby , &quot; about the birth of her beloved daughter , she sounds genuine in her emotions . Most affecting , perhaps , is her reprise of her affair with her latest husband , who seems literally and symbolically to have cured her of her long-held fear of flying . A passionate pilot who is transfigured each time he is airborne , and is eager to open such experience up_to the fearful Jong , he clearly becomes the perfect hero for Jong at 50 , with herself so eager to be &quot; free_of her body. &quot; And there ' s her interview with her father , in which she challenges him with , &quot; You ' d still like me to be a doctor , would n ' t you ? &quot; and he answers with compliments about how fine a writer she really is , and how her only problem is bad PR : &quot; Look_at Madonna . She ' s got no talent , but great PR . Why don ' t you call that Della Femina guy . He ' ll advise you. &quot; This is delightful too . What follows , however , is an editorial commentary she repeats after most of the charming narratives in the book , and it reads like a &quot; making_it &quot; whine : &quot; How can I explain to him that the vicissitudes of my career cannot be undone by mere ' PR. ' I have broken rules that are invisible to him because he is a man : written openly about sex , appropriated male picaresque adventures for women , poked_fun at the sacred_cows of our society . I have lived as I chose , married , divorced , remarried , divorced , remarried again -- and still worse dared to write_about my ex-husbands ! &quot; And with this comes her self-exculpatory conclusion that hers is &quot; the fate of rebellious women . They used to stone us in the marketplace . In a way , they still do. &quot; It begins to seem as if this is the pathetic refrain of her life . Mistake not . Jong ' s problem is not in having written_about her ( mis ) adventures but in presenting them as though they were the vital news , the real poop , and right for everywoman , instead of mere cliches formulating what Jong defines as the sexy , the liberated , the feminist life of courage . A sample of some of her profundities : &quot; Married_men are , of course the best lovers , unless you happen to be married to them. &quot; &quot; Divorce is my generation ' s coming of_age ceremony -- a ritual scarring. &quot; &quot; Dead mothers are rather easier for teenage girls to honor than live ones. &quot; &quot; Conversation . It fills a lot of life ' s little gaps. &quot; And perhaps the deepest , most Jongian , of all : &quot; You don ' t get_to choose what you get famous for and you don ' t get_to control which of your life ' s many struggles gets_to stand_for you. &quot; No kidding !</TEXT>
