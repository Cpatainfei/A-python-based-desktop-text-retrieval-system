   <HEADLINE> THE RELUCTANT NOVICE : A FEW SNAGS IN MASTERING ART OF FLY-FISHING ; THE SPORT CONJURES AN IMAGE OF SKILLFULLY CASTING A LINE WHILE SURROUNDED BY NATURE . BUT IN REALITY , THE REQUISITE SKILL MAY NOT COME NATURALLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a rule , art is truly appreciated only by those who understand it , which explains why after 20 minutes of browsing paintings that look_like mud smears most people start looking_for the cafeteria . Still , even for the ignorant , fly-fishing -- an artful sport if ever there was one -- possesses an undeniable beauty ; man and stream and a cloud of gossamer line filling the sky . No one jabs squirming bait on a hook , no one spills beer or fish guts on your shoes and no one barfs , at least not in the movies and PBS specials that define your exposure to the sport . Intrigued , you call Jerry Bliss . A fly-fisher of 27 years , Jerry is a polite fellow with the requisite craggy face , gravelly voice and straightforward manner of a lifelong outdoorsman . Better yet , for the past 16 years he ' s taught a fly-fishing course at Ventura College , patiently educating eager dilettantes in casting , fly tying and the myriad other intricacies that comprise fly-fishing ' s craft . And he has even worked with reporters , so he has a sound grasp of how journalism works . &quot; I think we could probably teach you the basics in two days , &quot; Jerry tells you . &quot; You ' re just writing an article , and you damn sure don ' t have to be an expert to do that. &quot; Your schooling begins on a rainy Monday with casting . &quot; The key to fly-fishing is being able to cast , &quot; says Jerry . &quot; About 10 % of the fly fishermen catch 90 % of the fish . that ' s because they can cast and they know how to present the fly. &quot; As he talks , Jerry flicks the rod gently . With each forward movement the line lashes_out straight and true before falling with less impact than a sigh . Jerry hands you the rod . You catch something on your fourth cast . Unfortunately it ' s the oak_tree in Jerry ' s front_yard , where Jerry has you practicing . &quot; To try and learn to cast and fish at_the_same_time is impossible , &quot; says Jerry , unsnagging the line from the tree . &quot; You need to get_the_hang of casting before you can even think_about catching fish. &quot; This should be easy . Physically a fly-fishing cast comprises little more_than moving your arm in a short , smooth arc , starting roughly at your chin , then moving_up to your ear and pausing for a beat before moving_back to your chin where a smart stop sends the line flying out . It ' s the same sort of motion employed by those human traffic cones who direct airplanes to and from their gates . It looks easy . It ' s not . Jerry moves rod and arm as one ; back , then forward , then back again -- chin to ear , ear to chin , chin to ear -- keeping the line snapping about in the air . &quot; One-two . One-two . One-two , &quot; he says . &quot; Keep your wrist locked and your motion straight. &quot; He stops on the forward_motion , and the line snakes straight out , lying neatly on the grass . &quot; See ? &quot; he says . &quot; The line follows the rod. &quot; Jerry hands the rod back to you . You promptly snag a hedge off to your right . &quot; I was a lousy caster for five or six years , &quot; says Jerry , perhaps hoping a little bonding will keep you from stripping the surrounding shrubbery naked . &quot; For beginners , working a fly_rod is really no different from a golf swing or a tennis swing . You flub it , you top it , you raise your head_up to see where it ' s going. &quot; Your own head is up enough to observe that Jerry is now standing a safe distance behind you . You suspect you have already distinguished yourself as the Gerald Ford of fly-fishing . After another ten minutes Jerry sidles cautiously to your side and grabs the rod . Like any good teacher , he never discounts the impossible . &quot; You ' re screwing_up worse , &quot; he says . &quot; You ' d better stop. &quot; You meet again three days later . Jerry is in a chipper mood . He may be in danger of losing an eye , but if fly-fishers love anything at all , it ' s fly-fishing . Jerry drives you an hour into the mountains . You ' ll be fishing Matilija Creek , a favorite spot for local anglers . Recent rains have the creek running fast and clear , good fishing conditions by Jerry ' s reckoning . The banks are also free_of trees and shrubbery , an important consideration given your hook ' s affinity for chlorophyll . Before getting started , Jerry ties a fly_on the end of the line . Choosing the proper fly is crucial . Keeping it simple , the rainbow_trout you ' ll be fishing for in Matilija Creek eat insects and their larvae . In selecting a fly , the fisherman ' s job is to &quot; match the hatch , &quot; approximating the local buffet as closely as possible . This isn ' t easy . By Jerry ' s own estimates there are over 70 # 000 different fly patterns -- wild-looking things that resemble aliens from space having a bad hair day -- and that number doesn ' t even include homemade flies . Fly selection is an inexact science . Why fish will strike at something that resembles Tina Turner ' s hairdo is a mystery . The essence of fly-fishing is simple . &quot; You have to choose the right fly and put it in the right spot at the right time , &quot; Jerry says . Because you can ' t do any of this , Jerry fishes first . Standing_in the creek he flicks the rod back and forth . The line shoots out about 15 feet , falling almost reluctantly on the water ' s surface . The idea is to toss the fly upstream from the fish , then have it float past like a hairy appetizer . &quot; See the fly_on the water now ? &quot; Jerry asks . You can ' t see anything but bubbles floating on the surface . &quot; You bet. &quot; &quot; Well once the line lands on the water , you pull it in so it ' s fairly tight , &quot; says Jerry . &quot; Then pull the line toward you nice and gradually. &quot; He peers intently at what you assume is the fly , while one hand slowly gathers_in line . &quot; You need to bring the line in to avoid getting slack , but don ' t bring it in too fast , &quot; he says . &quot; An insect isn ' t going_to look_like a motor boat. &quot; Within five minutes Jerry gets a bite , a four-inch rainbow_trout darting up from the bottom to snatch at the fly . Adroitly timing the trout ' s strike , Jerry sets the hook and reels the fish in . He holds it out briefly for your inspection -- a beautiful , slick spackle of gently heaving yellow and blue -- then slides it back into the water . &quot; that ' s the name of the game . Catch fish , &quot; he says , handing you the rod . Maybe for Jerry , but not for you . Your casting hasn ' t improved since earlier in the week . Your casts are all_over the stream , and the line crashes into the water like an anorexic bullwhip . At one point Jerry walks_around and unhooks the fly from the back of your jacket . You lash at the water for ten minutes but nothing comes_to the surface . Apparently all_the stupid fish have been caught . &quot; I didn ' t catch many fish in the beginning , &quot; Jerry says kindly . &quot; Fly-fishing is a matter of practice , practice , practice. &quot; And so you let Jerry do exactly that . It doesn ' t seem fair to let him stand_by while the fish are biting , though he assures you that ' s not the point . &quot; It doesn ' t matter_to me whether we catch anything or not , &quot; he says , proving his point by landing another trout and slipping it back into the creek . You sit_by the water ' s edge , listening to the creek run and watching Jerry cast , the silent line arcing in graceful , dozy loops , tracing what appears to be the Gettysburg Address in the sky . It is a thing of beauty . It seems so simple , you say . Jerry shakes his head and smiles before turning his attention back to the creek . &quot; I know , &quot; he says . &quot; I know. &quot;</TEXT>
