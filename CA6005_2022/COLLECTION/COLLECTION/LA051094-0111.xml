   <HEADLINE> SOUTHWEST LIFTING AIRPORT ' S BUSINESS ; BURBANK FACILITY ' S ONCE-SAGGING TRAFFIC , REVENUE ARE TAKING OFF , LED BY THE AIRLINE ' S RECENT BOOM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southwest Airlines ' money-making operations have put the rest of the troubled airline industry to shame . But Burbank Airport couldn ' t be happier . Thanks to the no-frills , low-cost shuttle operator , which began service at Burbank four years ago , the airport ' s once-declining traffic has boomed and its revenues are at a record high . Southwest started at Burbank Airport with 16 daily round-trip flights to Oakland and Las Vegas , and that ' s since grown to 48 flights a day to five cities -- more_than any of the other half-dozen carriers left at Burbank . Last year about 2.7 million people flew Southwest at Burbank , accounting_for nearly two out of every three passengers at the airport . Overall , Burbank Airport ' s passenger count totaled 4.3 million in 1993 , up 60 % from 1989 -- a higher percentage increase than any other commercial airport in the Los Angeles area . Southwest ' s traffic has helped fill_up Burbank Airport ' s parking_spaces and boosted sales of hot dogs and beer , as well as the landing fees the airport gets from airlines every time their planes touch_down at Burbank . As a result , the airport ' s revenue was $ 21 million in its fiscal_year that ended June 30 , 1993 -- up from about $ 15 million four years earlier -- and revenue is up again this year . Remarkably , this boom came during the state ' s recession . &quot; I can only fathom what would have happened if we had been in a bullish economy , &quot; said Thomas Greer , executive_director of the airport , formally known as the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport . Greer ' s glee , though , is tempered by the fact that there are risks in relying too_much on one customer . For 30 years Burbank Airport depended heavily on PSA , like Southwest , a commuter airline . But in 1987 , amid the turbulent era of deregulation and fare wars , USAir bought PSA and then began to retrench at Burbank Airport , beginning a slowdown at Burbank that only stopped with Southwest ' s arrival . Relying so_much on one airline could make_it tougher for Burbank Airport to get bond financing for its long-delayed $ 200-million project to build a bigger terminal . &quot; If you ' re in the hands of a single airliner , it does make you a little nervous , &quot; said Dick Mudge , president of Apogee Research , a Maryland firm that consults on airport economics . Still , Greer isn ' t worried . Though Southwest won ' t comment , Greer thinks the carrier is more likely to expand than contract at Burbank . The Dallas-based company is the industry ' s most profitable airline , last year having earned $ 154 million on revenue of $ 2.3 billion . And in its 23-year history , Southwest has pulled_out of only two airports -- Beaumont , Tex. , because of a lack of traffic , and Denver ' s Stapleton because weather delays were expensive . But even if Southwest abandoned Burbank , Greer is betting that some_other carrier would take its place . Burbank Airport is easier to get_in and out of than Los Angeles International Airport , Greer says , and there are 2.5 million people who live within a 15-mile radius of the 64-year-old Burbank Airport . &quot; The market is there. &quot; * Perhaps . But it took a low-cost airline like Southwest to tap that market . Victor Gill , Burbank Airport ' s public relations director , vividly recalls Southwest ' s inaugural flight to Oakland on April 16 , 1990 . The mood was festive inside Southwest ' s familiar burnt-orange Boeing 737 , as Southwest Chairman Herb Kelleher , dressed in the airline ' s new beige uniform , passed_out bags of peanuts to a full aircraft . But what Gill remembers most was Southwest ' s fare : $ 59 for an unrestricted one-way ticket to Oakland , compared with $ 180 for other airlines then serving that route . &quot; That was a clear indicator of what was going_to happen , &quot; Gill said . Overnight , demand for travel surged at Burbank from passengers like Michael Ernst , a Fremont businessman who says he doubled his trips between Oakland and Burbank , to twice a month , after Southwest arrived . &quot; I pay half as much so I can fly twice as much , &quot; he said . Ernst also likes it that Southwest has 13 daily shuttles from Burbank to Oakland , and his unrestricted ticket ( now $ 69 one-way ) allows him to take any one of them if seats are open . &quot; If I finish a meeting early , I can hop an earlier flight , &quot; he said on a recent afternoon at Burbank Airport . Southwest ' s arrival at Burbank forced other carriers to slash their prices . But the pressure was too_much for some airlines . In May , 1991 , USAir withdrew completely from Burbank , giving_up its 15 flights and the Northern California market to Southwest . &quot; It was strictly economics , &quot; says Bryan Enarson , USAir ' s director of airport affairs . USAir is loaded with the highest operating_costs of any major U . S . carrier . &quot; Routes from Burbank weren ' t profitable , &quot; Enarson said . &quot; And Southwest just continued that effect. &quot; * Delta , another major carrier that is now in the process of laying_off 15 # 000 employees , abandoned Burbank Airport last year , and others have slimmed down since Southwest muscled in . American Airlines dropped all six of its flights from Burbank to San Jose , United Airlines halted flights to Oakland , and America West reduced the number of shuttles to Las Vegas . &quot; We have some disadvantages versus Southwest , &quot; admitted Joe Hopkins , a spokesman for United , currently the second-largest carrier at Burbank Airport with 12 daily flights to its two major hubs , San Francisco and Denver . &quot; Southwest has had an impact on our business. &quot; Southwest , the nation ' s eighth-largest carrier , makes money where its rivals can ' t because of its low operating_costs . A Southwest pilot , for example , flies 70 hours a month versus 50 hours for a United pilot , and Southwest uses fewer employees per aircraft , while carrying more passengers , according to a recent Commercial Aviation Report . By specializing in short haul flights , Southwest avoids the huge expense of maintaining expensive hub systems , and keeps its planes in the air more often because it has few connecting flights . Southwest doesn ' t serve meals and gives no advanced seating assignments . In the 1990s , Southwest has been the only major American airline to turn a profit . In Southern California , Southwest flies out of eight airports , including LAX , and it is the dominant carrier at Ontario Airport , with about 40 % of the market there . Later this month , the airline will begin service at John Wayne Airport in Orange County , with 15 daily flights to Oakland and San Jose . Southwest ' s start-up at John Wayne could cut_into some of Burbank Airport ' s business , just as Burbank has lured travelers from LAX through Southwest ' s cut-rate fares . From 1989 to 1993 , as Burbank Airport ' s passengers surged by 60 % , or 1.6 million people , in that same period , the number of LAX ' s domestic passengers remained flat . As in other markets Southwest has entered , Burbank Airport has seen a surge in_demand for leisure travel . Jerry Hernandez of Santa Paula says that he had always driven five hours across the desert to visit Las Vegas . But on a recent afternoon , Hernandez was waiting for a Southwest flight to Las Vegas at Burbank Airport . Why ? A round-trip_ticket to Las Vegas for $ 65 under a Southwest special two-for-one deal . &quot; It just makes more sense , &quot; Hernandez said . Southwest won ' t talk_about future plans at Burbank , but airport officials hope the airline will soon add flights to Tucson , Albuquerque and Salt_Lake_City . Last year Southwest bought Salt Lake City-based Morris Air , another low-cost carrier , giving it entry into the Pacific Northwest market . &quot; Who knows where else we ' ll open_up ? &quot; says Robin Cobb , Southwest ' s station manager at Burbank Airport . Southwest ' s reticence makes Robert Garcin , president of the Burbank Airport Authority , which owns the airport , a bit uneasy , given that so_much is riding with Southwest , including plans to build a new terminal . Garcin and other airport officials have long dreamed about a new terminal building that would replace the current one that , under new federal standards , is too close to the runways . But concerns about airport noise and contamination on a proposed site have stalled the project . Airport officials still say the terminal will be opened in 1998 . The new terminal will probably cost at least $ 200 million . The airport now has about $ 20 million in cash , but the bulk of the funding is expected to come from a revenue_bond issue . And that will depend_on Burbank Airport ' s ability to generate sufficient passenger traffic and revenue , which will be boosted this fall when the airport will probably start imposing a $ 3 &quot; passenger facility charge &quot; on airline tickets of all outbound passengers . Garcin worries that the airport ' s reliance on Southwest could backfire when it comes_to issuing bonds . &quot; If I were a bond buyer , I ' d like to have more_than one carrier , &quot; he says . &quot; We ' ve put an awful lot of eggs in one basket , and it ' s a problem we ' ll have to face. &quot; But for now , Burbank has little choice . Garcin and others at the airport have been trying hard to woo new carriers to Burbank and encourage others already at the airport to expand . But with most other airlines struggling and afraid to go head to head with Southwest , airport officials admit they ' re not having much luck . The one carrier that Burbank Airport was close to attracting was Morris Air , but then Southwest bought_it . &quot; Expansion at Burbank isn ' t in the cards , &quot; said Al Becker , a spokesman at American Airlines , which is down to just three daily flights from Burbank , all_of them to its major hub in Dallas . &quot; It ' s perfectly understandable that Burbank Airport wants diversification , &quot; he said . &quot; But there ' s just no way we can compete &quot; with Southwest for the California market . Other rivals , including United , Delta and Continental , are trying to launch low-cost , short-haul clones of Southwest . But it ' s far from clear when and whether they would be able to challenge Southwest . Greer , the airport ' s director , says he wishes Burbank had more competition . &quot; Yes , it bothers me that Southwest dominates the airport , &quot; he said , only to quickly add : &quot; But it is Southwest . If we ' re going to have a dominant player , we ' re lucky we have the one that ' s making money. &quot; BURBANK AIRPORT ' S GROWTH Since its inaugural flight at Burbank Airport in April , 1990 , Southwest Airlines has become the dominant carrier at this regional airport . In four years the profitable , low-cost , shuttle operator has quadrupled its passenger traffic at Burbank to more_than 2.7 million . Southwest ' s success at Burbank has filled_up the airport ' s parking_spaces and concession stands , and has meant more fees that Burbank Airport gets from airlines every time they land , all_of which has helped lift the airport ' s once-flagging revenues to a record high .
