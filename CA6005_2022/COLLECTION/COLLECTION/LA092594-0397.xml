   <HEADLINE> HUMAN EMBRYO RESEARCH POSES ETHICS DILEMMA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Baltimore nurse Janice Pearse recalls her long quest to become pregnant using in-vitro fertilization through a lens of pain , embarrassment , disappointment -- and awe . The first time her eggs were mixed with her husband ' s sperm in a petri_dish and the doctor told her that embryos had been formed was an exhilarating moment because &quot; it ' s the closest to having a baby you ' ve ever been. &quot; But for every experimentally created embryo that is successfully implanted -- and Pearse was one of the lucky ones who eventually became pregnant -- thousands of unneeded embryos are frozen in storage -- or discarded . If it is acceptable to create an embryo for transfer into a woman ' s uterus -- as is now routine in fertility clinics -- is it ethical to experiment on an embryo in the laboratory ? Or just throw it away ? These are among the more troubling aspects of the new frontier of medical_science known as human embryo research . Many scientists believe that studying the human embryo -- at one week a cluster of cells no bigger than the period at the end of this sentence -- could yield infinite knowledge about nature ' s worst medical scourges . But like any science involved with creating or manipulating human life , it has become the focus of an intense international debate , and has raised numerous ethical dilemmas that have yet to be resolved . What , for example , is the moral status of a human embryo ? Is it acceptable to make an embryo in the lab only to use it for research -- especially when there are at least 12 # 000 unwanted embryos now frozen in storage and countless others that get tossed_away ? How far should research embryos be allowed to develop ? At what point does an embryo become a fetus ? Moreover , what kinds of research are appropriate -- and inappropriate ? The National Institutes of Health last year asked a panel of outside experts to wrestle with these questions , and its members are scheduled to release guidelines for federally funded embryo research Tuesday . Their report will undergo further scrutiny within NIH and be the subject of a public meeting in December . NIH Director Harold E . Varmus will then make the final_decision on what areas of research are acceptable for federal funding , and which guidelines should govern the work . While the panel is expected to endorse human embryo research generally , it will likely propose certain limitations . It probably will sanction the idea of pre-implantation diagnosis , for example , so parents worried about genetic risks can choose IVF and learn in_advance whether an embryo carries an inherited disease . But the panel is expected to deem it unacceptable to use such a technique only to determine sex . The panel also is likely to oppose cloning , or &quot; twinning , &quot; experiments , and research that uses human-animal combinations . It may , however , conclude that parthenogenesis -- a process that uses chemicals or electrical current to stimulate the development of an egg in the absence of sperm -- may be valuable in understanding egg development . These so-called parthenotes die several days after they are generated , and do not develop_into real embryos . Regardless of the panel ' s recommendations , they almost certainly will be controversial . Expressing the view of many scientists who are among the chief advocates of the research is Roger A . Pedersen , professor of radiology , anatomy and obstetrics , gynecology and reproductive sciences at UC San Francisco . Pedersen contends that &quot; a deeper understanding of the biological events of early human development will ultimately have profound implications for virtually all major areas of human health. &quot; But opponents , arguing with equal passion , maintain that tampering with human life is morally unjustified , regardless of the ultimate medical benefits . It is &quot; spooky and Frankenstein-esque , &quot; says Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) , who is leading a congressional effort to derail federal funding for such research . He charges that the NIH &quot; will give_rise to a new cottage industry in spare baby parts for its macabre experiments. &quot; The debate is similar in some respects_to one over the use of fetal tissue in medical research . Opponents argued that tissue obtained through abortion , which they deem the destruction of human life , should not be used toward the advancement of medicine , no matter how promising . Upon taking_office , President Clinton lifted a ban on federal funding for such research that had been in place since the Ronald Reagan_Administration . The current controversy , however , differs in one vital aspect : A major argument put forth by opponents of fetal research was that it would encourage more women to undergo abortions , which is not an issue here . Furthermore , the discussion of human embryo research concerns only the study of the embryo outside the uterus , that is , one that is produced in a laboratory by mixing sperm and egg . Such research is conducted on very early embryos , usually those less than one week old -- and certainly no later than 14 days . That is the point at which the so-called &quot; primitive streak &quot; appears . The &quot; primitive streak &quot; is an advancing line of cells that determines the embryo ' s head-tail , right-left orientation , and indicates the beginning of the development of individual organs . It is regarded_as the transition to a more sophisticated level of development . Aside from the question of when human life actually begins , many scientists do not regard an embryo as a fetus until it is at least eight weeks old . In this country , most research involving human embryos has been an adjunct to the clinical practice of in-vitro fertilization and other techniques for helping infertile couples become parents . Most other embryo research has involved the use of animals . But scientists believe that an increasing emphasis on human embryo research can enhance success rates for reproduction procedures . At present , fewer than one-fourth of the women who undergo in-vitro fertilization will give_birth to a child , and then usually only after repeated cycles of treatment . Beyond reproduction , many in the field also believe that human embryo research can provide new opportunities for understanding the mechanisms of cancer -- by studying the ways cells divide -- and genetic_disorders . New insights into genetics , for example , could prove critically important both in basic knowledge about how genes work and in determining , before an embryo is implanted into a woman ' s uterus , whether it carried a serious genetic_disorder . Thus informed , couples could decide whether or not to implant the embryo . Another potential benefit of human embryo research is as a source of cell lines . Certain cells in the early embryo are stem cells , meaning they have the potential to become any kind of body cell . This phenomenon raises the possibility that they could be grown and maintained indefinitely in culture in the lab , or even allowed to develop_into more specialized types of cells -- such_as blood , muscle and nervous_system cells -- which could be used in numerous therapies , such_as bone_marrow transplantation , repair of spinal_cord injuries or skin replacement for burn victims . Despite these potential clinical applications , the field evokes numerous troubling questions . If parents decide , for example , against implanting a defective embryo for genetic reasons , couldn ' t a couple decide against implantation on the basis of sex , which also could be determined in_advance ? And what are the boundaries of such research ? Last year , for example , researchers at George_Washington University Medical_Center here caused an uproar in scientific and ethical circles after they announced that they had experimentally cloned human embryos -- that is , divided them into identical_twins or triplets . The announcement marked the first time such a feat had been accomplished . The experiment raised the specter that , since human embryos could be frozen and used later , parents could have a child and then , several years later , have that child ' s identical_twin . Critics also raised the most extreme example of such work -- that parents could have an identical_twin years later to serve as an organ_donor for the older child . The angry response caused the researchers to announce they would abandon any further attempts at cloning embryos . One of the most pressing overall questions is whether embryos should be created solely for the purpose of research . &quot; I don ' t think an embryo is the moral equivalent of a person -- but having said that , I do think the human embryo is deserving of some special ethical status , &quot; says Arthur Caplan , director of the center for bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania . &quot; I don ' t think we should treat it as if it were a rock , or an insect , or a leaf , &quot; he adds . &quot; I don ' t think you should make them for research . I ' m real uncomfortable with that -- I would n ' t create something just to do research on it and destroy it. &quot; However , he believes that research should be conducted -- but only on embryos that already exist , such_as those in frozen storage or destined to be discarded . &quot; You ' ve got a lot of embryos around that no one wants , &quot; Caplan says . &quot; That is the place to do the research. &quot; Current regulation of the field is a patchwork of statutes , according to Andrea Bonnicksen , a political_science professor at Northern Illinois University who has done research on the subject . Several countries and 10 U.S. states have laws that monitor human embryo research , she says . California has no such regulations . Louisiana has the most restrictive statute , providing that &quot; no in-vitro fertilized human ovum will be farmed or cultured solely for research purposes or any other purposes. &quot; Norway explicitly forbids any human embryo research , other_than allowing that fertilized eggs be utilized only for implantation in women , and imposes fines and imprisonment on violators . Other countries , such_as Germany , Austria , Switzerland , France and Denmark , strictly regulate the research but do not prohibit it altogether . Britain , Spain and Sweden have more permissive regulations . Britain , where the first &quot; test_tube &quot; baby was conceived in 1978 , licenses clinics practicing IVF , and each research proposal involving human embryos must be approved by a national-level body . The U.S. guidelines , when final , will apply only to human embryo research projects that seek federal money and will not affect whatever work is being done privately . Nevertheless , &quot; public funding could bring such research into a realm where it would receive peer_review and be subject_to consistent regulation , &quot; says ethicist Lisa Sowle Cahill , professor of theology at Boston College . &quot; This is an important consideration in_view of the fact that this research is likely to continue , no matter what future policies are established for government funding. &quot;</TEXT>
