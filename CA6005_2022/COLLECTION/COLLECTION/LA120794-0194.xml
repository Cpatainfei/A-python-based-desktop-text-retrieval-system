   <HEADLINE> O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY ; PROTECTION FILING MAY SPARK PANIC SELLING ; BONDS : BIG INVESTORS MAY FACE HEAVY LOSSES ON CURRENT ISSUES , AND COUNTY COULD BE SHUT OUT OF MARKET FOR NEW OFFERINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s dramatic decision to seek bankruptcy protection Tuesday is likely to touch_off some panic selling of existing bonds today and kill the county ' s ability to return to the bond market in the immediate future . While the bankruptcy freezes the county ' s repayment obligations and gives it time to assess its finances , it will force many large investors to sell at steep discounts , because there are legal restrictions on the amount of troubled debt they can hold_in their portfolios , said John Schotz , president of Saybrook Capital , a Los Angeles investment banking firm . And less sophisticated individual investors are likely to follow_suit , said Lewis G . Feldman , head of the capital markets group of Cox , Castle &amp; Nicholson , a Los Angeles public finance law_firm . Further curtailing the county ' s ability to raise future bond money were decisions Tuesday evening by Moody ' s Investors Service to suspend the county ' s bond_ratings and by Standard &amp; Poor ' s Corp . to slash its rating on all Orange County debt . Officials at both rating agencies said they could cut the county ' s ranking to Triple-C as early as this morning , which would rank them as &quot; poor quality &quot; junk_bond investments . In announcing its suspension , Moody ' s said : &quot; There is little precedent to draw upon to predict the degree to which the federal bankruptcy court will protect debt holders. &quot; The anticipated downgradings are one of the factors likely to force institutional investors to start dumping Orange County bonds this morning , said Schotz . Panicky investors already tried to unload Orange County bonds Tuesday , only to find that no one wanted them . And if it was difficult to sell the county ' s paper without drastic discounts before the Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing , it will only become more difficult . That , however , could create an opportunity for speculative investors who have faith that the county is a safe long-term bet and who would offer to buy bonds at much-reduced prices . &quot; People used the same approach to pick_up junk_bonds and real_estate when those markets hit the skids , &quot; Feldman said . &quot; The long-term prospects for Orange County are excellent , &quot; agreed Jeremy Ragus , California Tax Free Fund portfolio manager at Scudder , Stevens &amp; Clark in Boston . &quot; There is no real general obligation debt &quot; that encumbers the county ' s tax_revenue &quot; and it is a fast-growing , high-energy , wealthy community that is going_to survive this. &quot; The Orange County Sanitation Districts found_out Tuesday how scant the market was for Orange County debt . The agency could not find a buyer for $ 4 million worth of its notes -- basically interest-bearing IOUs -- as it tried to complete a scheduled refinancing of the paper , said Steve Kozak , the districts ' financial manager . Richard G . Paget , managing director and head of the municipal_bond department at Baltimore-based Alex . Brown &amp; Sons , said the situation &quot; reminded me of the run_on banks in the 1930s , &quot; when everyone tried to get their money out at_the_same_time . &quot; The situation was simple , &quot; Paget said . &quot; People wanted their money out and couldn ' t get it. &quot; After offering_prices of Orange County bonds continued to plunge Tuesday , they were generally 15 % less than those of similar bonds from other municipalities . Prices are likely to fall much further today . While uncertainty about Orange County ' s situation kept its bondholders and bankers on edge Tuesday , the overall bond market had a strong day as traders grew optimistic that the Federal_Reserve has raised interest_rates enough to flatten inflation . Bond yields fell , continuing a weeklong rally in market_prices . As yields fall , bond prices rise . The market ' s benchmark , the 30-year Treasury_bond , was up 52.5 cents as its yield fell to 7.87 % from 7.92 % . &quot; Everyone is scrambling , we ' re under pressure to find ( Treasury ) bonds &quot; because of high demand , said Rissy Mell , a trader at Josephthal , Lyon &amp; Ross in New York . Even foreign trading was affected as news about Orange County ' s problems spurred heavy bond sales on the Tokyo Exchange , traders there reported . On Wall_Street , however , conflicting rumors and reports about the Orange County situation &quot; continue to foster a misinformed market &quot; for those bonds , one trader said . A senior executive at one of the four biggest Wall_Street firms , who declined to be identified , said Orange County ' s bankruptcy was made inevitable after it hired a private firm that began approaching leading brokerages Monday to try to liquidate the county ' s huge holdings of derivatives -- a type of security whose value is linked to the market_value of an underlying stock , bond , index or commodity . The executive said all_of the firms approached turned the county down . They rejected taking_on such a monumental task partly because they found that the funds ' losses on the derivatives were much larger than the $ 1.5 billion that has been publicly reported . He declined to give a specific figure but said his firm concluded that it ' s &quot; hundreds of millions &quot; more_than that , although not double the amount . It isn ' t only large institutional bondholders who are asking questions that so far have no answers . &quot; What does_it mean ? &quot; bemoaned retiree Jack Brownstone , a Rancho Mirage resident who owns about $ 15 # 000 worth of Orange County bonds . &quot; What happens to the value of my bond ? Is it like when New York went bankrupt and the state guaranteed the funds ? &quot; Diamond Bar resident John Anderson , who says he owns a number of Orange County bonds through a municipal_bond mutual_fund , said Tuesday that he ' s afraid he could lose much-needed retirement income and is outraged that &quot; somebody was allowed to mismanage funds to this degree. &quot; Former county treasurer Robert L . Citron resigned Sunday amid increasing criticism of his high-risk investing style , but Anderson wonders if the blame should be placed on Citron alone . &quot; I don ' t know how a person could be given that much authority without anyone else knowing about it , &quot; Anderson said , suggesting that county supervisors and financial officials of other agencies that collectively invested more_than $ 7.5 billion through Citron should have exercised more oversight . Given that government bankruptcies are rare , with the laws governing them somewhat different than for other bankruptcies , even some sophisticated money managers were clueless Tuesday about the impact . &quot; Threatening to file bankruptcy is hysterical behavior unless there is something there that we don ' t know , ( perhaps ) that liabilities outweigh assets &quot; in the county pool , said Fred Prager , a partner with the San Francisco bond_trading firm of Prager , McCarthy &amp; Lewis . &quot; This is groundbreaking material here , &quot; said W . Peck Ferrin , head municipal trader for Bank of America in San Francisco . &quot; None of us has a handle on exactly what a Chapter 9 does &quot; or how it affects bondholders . Bank of America is a leading underwriter of county bond issues . Another major underwriter may have felt a sting from the bankruptcy rumors that circulated all day Tuesday . Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. , which has loaned the county $ 2.5 billion to purchase securities , saw its common_stock drop $ 1 to $ 36.25 in heavy New York Stock_Exchange trading . Bond_Ratings : What They Mean Municipal_bonds are rated according to their likelihood of going_into default--the inability to pay interest to bondholders . Those rated AAA are considered least likely to default . Tuesday one of the nation ' s two major rating services , Standard &amp; Poor ' s , indicated it is likely to drop Orange County ' s rating from AA to CCC . What the ratings signify : 03 # 34 , 11 # 10 Moody ' s Investors Standard Rating explanation Service &amp; Poor ' s Highest quality Aaa AAA High_quality Aa AA Upper medium grade A A Medium grade Baa BBB Predominantly speculative Ba BB Speculative , low grade B B Poor quality Caa CCC Highest speculation Ca CC Lowest quality , no interest paid C C In default DDD In arrears DD Questionable value D Source : Barron ' s Dictionary of Banking Terms</TEXT>
