   <HEADLINE> TRADE_WINDS ARE BLOWING ACROSS AMERICAS ; FORGET NAFTA . THE SOUTH ' S ' SAFTA ' HAS ALREADY BEEN FREEING UP MARKETS FOR TWO YEARS . AND SMALLER BLOCS ARE FORMING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What once seemed like ivory_tower daydreaming is now reality in the making : Huge trade blocs are forming up and down the Americas to let goods and services pass freely across international borders . Not only is there a NAFTA -- the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , stretching from the Yukon to the Yucatan . There is also a SAFTA -- a South_American free-trade area that extends from Amazonia to Patagonia . The South_American bloc , officially known as Mercosur , unites Brazil , Argentina , Paraguay and Uruguay in a promising market of 200 million people . As of today , Mercosur gives a discount of 82 % on customs duties in trade among the partners . It will be 100 % duty-free by Jan . 1 , 1995 . That will make Mercosur a full-fledged free-trade zone many years before North_America is . Members of Mercosur boast that their 1991 pact has already boosted intra-bloc trade by billions of dollars . &quot; Mercosur is 2 years old , &quot; said Hector Gambarotta , the_Argentine Foreign Ministry ' s secretary for international economic relations . &quot; If this had happened in countries of the north , we would be talking_about the most spectacular success of the century. &quot; Mercosur countries have agreed to set common tariffs for many goods imported from other countries , something NAFTA has not done . That means the South_American bloc will soon be a &quot; customs union , &quot; a major step toward status as a complete common_market like the European Community . &quot; There are irreversible processes that you can ' t stop , &quot; said Jorge Lucangeli , an adviser to the_Argentine Foreign Ministry . &quot; This is a project that advances almost by itself. &quot; On the other side of South_America , Colombia , Venezuela , Ecuador and Bolivia are forming an Andean free-trade area . In Central_America and the Caribbean , smaller trade blocs are emerging . And many countries are entering bilateral or trilateral pacts outside the main blocs . The integration movement is happening so fast , in fact , that free-trade agreements between countries are beginning to overlap in a crazy-quilt fashion that some economists fear may be difficult to sort_out and manage . As free_trade spreads through Latin_America , almost all_the countries involved are interested in joining the colossal NAFTA to the north . Thus , former President George_Bush ' s idea of one hemispheric free-trade area , from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego , is gathering force . Although President Clinton has not promoted the idea by the name Bush gave it in 1990 -- Enterprise for the Americas Initiative -- he has brought it closer to realization by pushing for congressional passage of NAFTA and by promising free-trade negotiations with other Latin_American countries . Outside NAFTA , by far the biggest free-trade group in the Americas is Mercosur . Its four countries produce goods and services worth $ 630 billion a year , far greater than Mexico ' s gross_domestic_product and about half the Latin_American total . Incremental reductions in customs duties among members have shown dramatic results . Since 1990 , trade within the bloc has more_than doubled , surpassing $ 9 billion in 1993 . Although progress has been rapid , it has not always been easy . In recent negotiations , the four countries have deadlocked on the issue of setting a common level of tariffs on select products imported from non-member countries . Officials agreed on_duties ranging from nothing to 20 % for more_than four-fifths of products . But Brazil balked on lowering tariffs that protect computer equipment makers and capital goods such_as factory machinery . Argentina wants no duties on such products so it can modernize its industries with high-tech equipment from Europe , the United States and Asia . But Brazil fears that competition from such imports will undermine its own computer and capital goods industries . A summit of Mercosur presidents , scheduled for December , was delayed until Jan . 17 , partly because of that unresolved issue . At that Uruguay meeting , the presidents are expected to announce that common external tariffs for those products must be worked_out over the next few years . But the presidents will reaffirm their determination to end all internal duties at the end of 1994 as scheduled , Brazilian and Argentine officials say . Argentine industrialists have urged the swift elimination of tariffs . They say that Brazilian subsidies and &quot; unfair &quot; trade practices put Argentine producers at a disadvantage . Jorge Gaibisso of the_Argentine Industrial Union said his main concern is that Brazil ' s galloping inflation and economic confusion camouflage the real cost of industrial production . This makes_it possible for Brazilians to make exports more competitive by unfairly manipulating prices , Gaibisso said . &quot; The basic point here is that Brazil is in a chaotic economic situation , &quot; he said . Argentine industrialists want to postpone final free-trade measures for two years &quot; so that Brazil can put itself in_order , &quot; he explained . Argentina and Brazil , like most Latin_American countries , have protected their industries with high trade_barriers . The aim was to foster industrial growth through &quot; import substitution &quot; -- replacing imports with as_many locally produced products as possible . The policy seemed to work from the 1950s through the 1970s . But then protected industries began falling_behind in efficiency and technology . As their stagnation became evident , economies began dropping commercial barriers , opening_up to foreign competition . Today , most Latin economies operate_on the theory that they will do best by importing goods they cannot produce competitively . To pay_for imports , they seek to increase exports they can produce with a competitive advantage . Other changes also have helped . The transition from military dictatorships to democracy in many Latin_American countries in the 1980s gave the region a common_denominator of civilian government , easing trade negotiations . Most of the countries also have recovered from staggering foreign debt crises , coupled with high inflation and recession ; those factors discouraged free-trade efforts in the 1980s . But problems still abound . Brazilian inflation , more_than 2 # 200 % in 1993 , is a worrisome element of instability for Mercosur . Argentina ' s overvalued peso , which the government has frozen in a one-to-one exchange_rate with the U.S. dollar , also causes trouble . Progress in free_trade between Brazil and Argentina is expected to require at least some coordination of sensitive national policies that influence fair competition : monetary controls ; exchange_rates ; taxes , agricultural and industrial incentives , and labor regulations . Despite difficulties , even critics admit that the South_American free-trade agreement is starting to work . &quot; It ' s not the end of the road , &quot; said Marcos Azambuja , Brazil ' s ambassador to Argentina . &quot; It ' s our first gas station. &quot; Emerging Blocs Although residents of the United States , Mexico and Canada have been fixated on prospects for their nations ' new trade pact -- the North_American Free_Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) -- several Latin_American countries have leaped ahead in efforts to boost regional cooperation . Here ' s a look_at their emerging economic blocs : MERCOSUR 1 . BRAZIL Pop : 157.2 million GNP : $ 423 billion Inflation_rate : 2 # 244 % Analysis : Trade bloc ' s potential economic engine . But to fulfill promise , must control inflation , seek more stability in government . 2 . ARGENTINA Pop. : 33.5 million GNP : $ 186 billion Inflation_rate : 7.7 % Analysis : Over-values its peso and has locked itself in problematic , 1-to-1 exchange_rate against U.S. dollar . 3 . PARAGUAY Pop. : 4.6 million GNP : $ 8.7 billion Inflation_rate : 19.5 % Analysis : As poorest country in group , must stretch to catch_up but has most to gain . 4 . URUGUAY Pop. : 3.1 million GNP : $ 11.8 billion Inflation_rate : 52.3 % Analysis : With good ports and strategic location , will profit from Mercosur shipping . * ANDEAN GROUP 1 . COLOMBIA Pop. : 34 million GNP : $ 63.5 billion 2 . VENEZUELA Pop. : 20.7 million GNP : $ 95 billion 3 . ECUADOR Pop. : 11.3 million GNP : $ 17.8 billion 4 . BOLIVIA Pop. : 7.7 million GNP : $ 8.4 billion * NAFTA 1 . UNITED STATES Pop. : 260 million GDP : $ 6.24 trillion 2 . MEXICO Pop. : 91.3 million GDP : $ 371 billion 3 .
