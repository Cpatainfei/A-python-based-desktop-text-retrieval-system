   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; DREAMS OF WEALTH OR FOOL ' S GOLD ? ; ORANGE COUNTY HEIRS ARE FIGHTING FOR A STAKE IN A FABLED COLORADO MINE . BUT A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY ' S TRUSTEE AND A TEXAS JUDGE HAS MUDDLED AN ALREADY TWISTED TALE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Truth is , none of Nettie MacDougall ' s kin paid much heed when she spun yarns about owning a chunk of a famous gold mine in the foothills here . Just fanciful talk from &quot; ol ' Aunt Net , &quot; everyone assumed . So it wasn ' t until long after MacDougall had passed_away that her great-nephew , Costa Mesa handyman Scott Hobbs , got curious and picked_up the phone last year to ask the family trustee about his potential inheritance . Trustee : &quot; At the lowest estimate , you know how much ( the gold mine ) is worth , Scott ? &quot; Hobbs : &quot; How much ? &quot; Trustee : &quot; Five billion dollars. &quot; that ' s billion -- with a B . Here in this frontier town on the outskirts of Denver , about 1 # 000 miles from the Orange County Fedco store where the 31-year-old Hobbs toils away at $ 10 an hour , sits the world-renowned Glory_Hole , a gold mine that his great-aunt helped establish during the Depression . Although the precise worth of Aunt MacDougall ' s precious property remains a matter of some debate in these parts , Hobbs hopes to soon swap his handyman ' s apron_strings for a millionaire ' s purse_strings . The hole , he figures , represents his way_out of the rut of blue-collar life . &quot; I know one thing , &quot; said Hobbs , who has begun taking business classes to ready himself for his new career . &quot; I ' m not going_to have to worry about money again. &quot; But Hobbs shouldn ' t buy that new ranch just yet . Today , the Glory_Hole mine and the plum real_estate it resides on are at the center of a sinuous tale that has all_the makings of a spaghetti Western . There are bodies stuffed down mine shafts . There are pine-studded hills containing tons of $ 390-an-ounce gold . There ' s casino gambling . And there ' s a peculiar lawsuit involving a Texas judge who , with a little help from a colleague , managed to turn a $ 1.25-million claim into a $ 15.5-million judgment . The upshot ? It may mean that no one in the MacDougall line will get as much as an ounce of fool ' s gold . To some , the twisted tale amounts to a bona_fide claim jump , 1990s style , involving what locals regard_as the &quot; richest square_mile on Earth. &quot; The three main players in this modern gold_rush drama : Hobbs , the handsome , unassuming heir hoping to trade his rags for riches ; Harold Caldwell , 74 , the weathered trustee of the Glory_Hole whose mien and manner remind one of actor Jack Palance , and Judge Robert F . Barnes , a gravel-voiced south Texan who uses phrases such_as &quot; nervous as a pregnant nun &quot; and who is dead-set on settling an old score with Caldwell . James K . Kreutz , one of 19 attorneys involved in the case , blames gold fever , an ailment that has broken_out with periodic virulence in this part of the country since James_Buchanan ' s days in the White_House . &quot; Gold , &quot; Kreutz said , &quot; has a way of obscuring people ' s vision. &quot; * Here , in Colorado ' s Gilpin County , perched atop Oh My God Road and steep , partially paved thoroughfares snaking their way_out of suburban Denver , gold falls just shy of religion . And at stake in the MacDougall clan ' s battle is a storied mine that has seen its share of worshipers . Historians have penned entire books on the Glory_Hole and its central place in Colorado ' s century-old gold_rush . Area gift_shops peddle postcards of it , trumpeting the more_than $ 200 million in gold that the 700-foot-long mine has produced ( and that was when gold went_for a_few dollars an ounce ) . One of the big new casinos in town even adopted the Glory_Hole name . &quot; It ' s an amazing place , and only God knows how much gold is down there , &quot; said Caldwell , an old-time miner who has fought 35 years of legal and personal battles as the Glory_Hole ' s trustee-caretaker . &quot; that ' s why everyone wants a piece of it. &quot; Before the legalized gambling boom hit this county three years ago , before casinos began dotting the mountainous landscape and slot_machines became Central_City ' s hottest tourist commodity , this was a town that was defined by the lure and mystique of gold . Guarded by primeval , 14 # 000-foot-high peaks , mound after mound of mine rubble , hundreds of creaky shafts and 50 miles of tunnels , the place is reminiscent_of an age when prospectors sifted every creek_bed and burrowed every hillside in the rush to get rich . From the first discovery of shimmering nuggets in the gurgling shallows of nearby Cherry Creek in 1859 , thousands of settlers stormed the Central Rockies in Colorado to lay claim to minerals that could bring an industrious miner a small_fortune . So quickly did word spread of the treasure lying beneath the majestic hills of Central_City and nearby Black Hawk that President Abraham_Lincoln , after the Civil War , dispatched a message to Central_City miners , saying he was sending reinforcements to unearth the gold and silver to help relieve the nation ' s war debt . &quot; There is room for all , &quot; he said , and he was not far from the truth . In the 1920s , William Mark Muchow , an enterprising Chicago dentist known as Doc , made_it his mission to buy the Glory_Hole and the rest of the roughly 300 mines in the region -- among them , Big Thunder , Little Raven and Matty May -- and merge them into a gold-producing conglomerate . Nettie MacDougall , a railroad machinist supervisor in Illinois for 45 years , met Muchow in Chicago during the Depression and signed_on as one of the original 10 investors in his start-up mining_company . ( No one knows how much she paid in. ) One company document from 1969 lists her as an officer of the Chain O ' Mines firm , as it was to become known . At its peak between 1929 and 1937 , the Glory_Hole turned_out 200 # 000 ounces of gold , 18 tons of silver and 1 million tons of lead , zinc and iron . It ranked as one of the biggest mineral producers in the country and attracted visitors of all stripes . Although it is unclear how much MacDougall benefited from her Glory_Hole investment before her death in 1985 , she never doubted that the place would prove , quite literally , a gold mine for her heirs . &quot; She was always saying how we ' d all be millionaires , &quot; recalled Irene MacDougall , 82 , of Homestead , Mich. , whose late husband was MacDougall ' s brother . &quot; She ' d say what she would do for the family , how she ' d take us all on a trip around the world. &quot; After her death , MacDougall , who never married , left_behind properties in Illinois and Florida , as well as $ 100 # 000 in cash . But the family put so little stock in her gold mine talk that no one pursued the Glory_Hole entry in her will when it came time to settle her estate . At least not until Hobbs , the Costa Mesa handyman , got involved in January , 1993 . If MacDougall ' s heirs do wind_up with a chunk of the Glory_Hole , family members agree , it will be largely through his perseverance . Hobbs , a soft-spoken man who resembles a surfer more_than a would-be mining mogul , visited the Glory_Hole last year . What he found was a mine with a decidedly erratic record . Despite its fame , the Glory_Hole has sat silent for much of its 135-year history , its crater testimony to the difficulty of trying to wring a fraction of gold out of a ton of silt and stone . When running , the Chain O ' Mines machinery can churn through 750 tons of rock and minerals a day , processing it all through a rickety , musty , wood mill that was built_in 1926 . But just as often , it seems , production has been plagued by problems : caps on gold prices ; two well-publicized &quot; swindles &quot; that are said to have robbed the company of millions in joint_ventures , and personal problems and distractions that Caldwell said have left him with scant time to restart full-scale mining at the Glory_Hole -- the charge he was given_in 1969 when the aging Chain O ' Mines officers tapped him to be trustee because of his loyalty . &quot; I always believed that it was my job to get the property back into production , &quot; Caldwell said . &quot; But it wasn ' t even profitable to mine gold till probably the late ' 70s. &quot; The distractions for Caldwell took a macabre turn_in 1981 , when two miners -- including the father of a close friend -- vanished near the Glory_Hole . Relatives suspected they had been murdered and their bodies dumped into one of the hundreds of mines peppering the area . Chain O ' Mines employees searched for nine years before authorities found the skeletal remains of the men in 1990 . Just as their families had speculated , the two had been buried along with their pickup_truck in an abandoned 400-foot shaft . Two men were convicted of clubbing the miners to death with lead pipes , but authorities never could corroborate testimony linking the killings to a San Jose businessman who went_to prison for orchestrating a multimillion-dollar gold scam involving the Glory_Hole . Family members suspected that the miners were slain because they had discovered the plot . * The Glory_Hole ' s most vexing problem , however , is a convoluted legal row that has as_many twists as a mile-long mine shaft : Texas Judge Barnes in 1989 successfully sued Caldwell for reneging_on a $ 50 # 000 cash loan and on a promise to repay a $ 1.2-million bank loan Barnes took_out on Caldwell ' s behalf . More important , as far as MacDougall ' s heirs are concerned , Barnes -- who was an attorney who dabbled_in real_estate before joining the bench in 1988 -- subsequently succeeded in persuading a Colorado court to make the Glory_Hole and the other Chain O ' Mines properties subject_to the judgment against Caldwell . This despite Caldwell ' s insistence that he never owned the property and the fact that his dispute with Barnes stemmed from a soured real_estate deal in south Texas . The result : The Glory_Hole and the rest of the Chain O ' Mines properties have been put into court-ordered receivership by Colorado District Judge Kenneth Barnhill . Which means that , for now , whatever income the properties generate goes_to Barnes , according to reams of court documents on file_in Texas and Colorado . The news got_even worse for Caldwell last week : Barnhill signed an order allowing the sheriff to sell_off all or part of the property to satisfy the multimillion-dollar judgment . Caldwell ' s lawyers vow an immediate appeal , but they admit it will be a tough fight . Also , the legal troubles have derailed Caldwell ' s and the MacDougall heirs ' hopes of getting the Glory_Hole back into full production for the first time in more_than a decade . To hear Scott Hobbs , his mother , Susan , and surviving MacDougalls tell it , all_of this amounts to a thinly veiled plot to lay claim to their gold at a time when its price -- nearly $ 400 an ounce -- and technological advances make mining quite lucrative . Scott Hobbs recently filed a complaint with the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct , alleging collusion on the part of Barnes and the Texas judge who gave Barnes the multimillion-dollar award in the case , Joe B . Evins . As colleagues and friends , Barnes , who declines to give his age , and Evins , 68 , have lived and worked in tiny Hidalgo County , near the Mexican border , for the better part of a half-century . Although there is no evidence to support the family ' s allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the judges , Scott Hobbs and Caldwell ' s attorneys point to irregularities in the $ 15.5-million judgment Barnes received . Although the original Barnes-Caldwell transaction involved $ 50 # 000 cash and a $ 1.2-million bank loan , Evins awarded Barnes $ 15 # 550 , 000 , including $ 10 million in punitive damages . With interest , the judgment exceeds $ 20 million . How does a $ 1.2-million lawsuit become a $ 15.5-million judgment ? &quot; Good question , &quot; said Kreutz , a Colorado attorney who represents Caldwell . &quot; But you can ask_for the moon when the other side doesn ' t show up. &quot; Which brings_up another intriguing issue in the case , Caldwell ' s attorneys say : Within the thick courthouse files are affidavits from a process server , DeWayne Perdew , and his girlfriend , Lucy Lackey , who said they were not even in the same state as Caldwell on the date he was supposedly served by Perdew with notice of Barnes ' lawsuit . They were at a George Strait country_music concert in Cheyenne , Wyo. , they said . Perdew provided the affidavit despite the fact that he could face perjury charges . Initially , Perdew said he had served papers on Caldwell in_person on July 30 , 1989 , court documents say . What is clear from court documents is that Caldwell did not attend the judgment hearing , where Evins heard arguments only from one side -- Barnes ' . Evins denied any wrongdoing in awarding the $ 15.5-million judgment , saying it was &quot; far-fetched &quot; to suggest any &quot; hanky-panky , &quot; was going_on . &quot; would n ' t make a damn bit of difference if it was the President of the United States or if I had known the plaintiff all my life , &quot; he said . Although Evins acknowledged that the size of the judgment was unusual given the sum in the original dispute , he deemed it reasonable because Caldwell , he said , has an unusual amount of assets . &quot; The idea of punitive damages is to punish , &quot; Evins said . &quot; If your net worth is . . . $ 100 million , $ 10 # 000 would hardly be punitive. &quot; Barnes declined to comment on whether it was fair that MacDougall ' s relatives may lose their inheritance because of his unrelated feud with Caldwell . Saying that he has reached an age where he doesn ' t want any enemies , Barnes emphasized that he had no interest in the Glory_Hole or any other mine in the Chain O ' Mines company . &quot; It ' s a piece of a mountain as far as I ' m concerned , &quot; said Barnes , who also denied impropriety . &quot; I ' m satisfied that it ' s a good judgment. &quot; The original judgment and subsequent rulings that have put the ownership of the Chain O ' Mines in jeopardy have reached state appellate_courts in Colorado and Texas . &quot; The problem with this case , &quot; Evins observed , &quot; is you ' ve got some lying goin ' on . . . . Everybody ' s a suspect in a $ 15-million lawsuit. &quot; * Especially when what ' s at stake is a gold mine . Just how much the Glory_Hole and the rest of the Chain O ' Mines property -- which consists_of hundreds of smaller gold mines and mostly prime acreage in and around thriving Central_City -- is worth today depends_on whom you ask . Estimates range from $ 792 million to $ 22 billion . Skeptics insist that the real gem of the company ' s portfolio is the land it owns near downtown Central_City , where casino owners are parting_with handsome sums to put_up Las Vegas-style gambling_houses . But old-timers believe the gold-steeped veins of the Glory_Hole and surrounding mines have barely been scratched . Yes , the easy-to-get gold has been harvested . But below the surface lies much more , they say . A 1985 study by Chain O ' Mines engineer-geologist Donald J . McCoy Jr . estimated that the Glory_Hole holds 50 million tons of ore reserves , worth an estimated $ 5.3 billion in gold , silver , copper , lead and other minerals . For now , though , the hands of the Hobbses and MacDougalls are bound . The families have retained attorneys to try to sever the Chain O ' Mines property from the Caldwell-Barnes dispute . Even if they succeed , other surviving heirs of the original 10 Chain O ' Mines investors might surface and lay claim to the Glory_Hole . In the meantime , Hobbs has emerged as the choice of the handful of MacDougall heirs and Caldwell to become trustee of the company and do whatever it takes_to pluck the mine from the legal red_tape in which it is entangled . Caldwell , who said it ' s time to step_down , has promised Hobbs the trusteeship , along with a share of whatever piece of the Glory_Hole the family ends_up getting . By day , Hobbs constructs sales displays and &quot; fixes things &quot; around the Fedco store . But each night , he returns to a cramped studio_apartment in Newport Beach , crammed with meticulously bound notebooks all dedicated to the Glory_Hole , its gold and his Aunt Nettie MacDougall ' s legacy , a legacy he hopes to preserve . &quot; The prize , &quot; he said , &quot; is so damned big. &quot;</TEXT>
