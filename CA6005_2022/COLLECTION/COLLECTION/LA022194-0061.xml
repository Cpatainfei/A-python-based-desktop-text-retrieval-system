   <HEADLINE> A CONFIDENT GRAF WILL BE TOUGH TO BEAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steffi Graf has dominated the Women ' s Tennis Assn . tour in the 10-month absence of Monica Seles , who has not played since she was stabbed by a spectator last April 30 during a tournament at Hamburg , Germany . Graf has won 10 of her last 11 tournaments , including all four Grand_Slam events , and is 60-2 since May 2 , when she lost to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the final at Hamburg . So , the focus will be_on Graf in the Evert Cup , which runs today through Sunday at Hyatt Grand Champions . The seven other seeded players in the 32-player field -- Mary Joe Fernandez , Lindsay Davenport , Natalia Zvereva , Helena Sukova , Amanda Coetzer , Sabine Hack and Judith Wiesner -- are a combined 2-73 against the world ' s top-ranked player . Zina Garrison-Jackson has withdrawn because of a sore Achilles ' tendon . Second-seeded Fernandez , who won the Evert Cup last year but is winless in 11 matches against Graf , said : &quot; She is pretty invincible right now . She ' s very confident , and when Steffi gets confident , it ' s tough to beat her . She ' s really on a high. &quot; What will it take_to beat her ? &quot; You have to play very aggressively , &quot; Fernandez said . &quot; You can ' t let her dictate play . She ' s very fast and , obviously , when she ' s on_the_offensive , you ' re in big trouble . &quot; It ' s hard to ( play her aggressively ) because she has a big serve , but the players that have done_well against her are the ones who have attacked her and have been able to put her under pressure. &quot; JERRY CROWE</TEXT>
