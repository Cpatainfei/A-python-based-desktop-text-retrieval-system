   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb forces Thursday began what U.N. observers called a massive withdrawal from mountaintop artillery nests ringing Sarajevo , offering the first serious sign that they may comply with a NATO ultimatum to end their siege or face air strikes . U.N. officials reported large weapons convoys moving away from the Bosnian capital , an apparent effort by the Serbian rebels to comply with a week-old NATO order to withdraw or surrender all heavy_weapons within a 12-mile radius of the capital by 1 a.m. Monday , Sarajevo time . &quot; It is a very heartening sign , &quot; said Col . Bill Aikman , spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia . &quot; Clearly , there ' s a major withdrawal going on. &quot; Since NATO issued its ultimatum , fewer than three dozen of the Serbs ' hundreds of heavy artillery pieces had been removed before Thursday . But U.N. observers reported the dramatic increase in compliance efforts after Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic met with a senior Russian envoy and announced that his nationalist forces will meet the NATO demand . The envoy , Vitaly Churkin , conveyed to Karadzic a promise from Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin to contribute Russian soldiers to any new peacekeeping duties in Sarajevo if the Serbs would withdraw their heavy_weapons from around the city , and urged them to turn_over their artillery to U.N. forces &quot; without delay. &quot; The two men met in Pale , the Bosnian Serb stronghold southeast of Sarajevo . Churkin said after the talks that the Serbs had agreed to withdraw their weapons . It was not clear whether that pledge resulted from the Russian offer or the looming threat of NATO attacks , but Yeltsin ' s government claimed credit . Yeltsin ' s spokesman , Vyacheslav Kostikov , said in Moscow that the Russian offer and the positive response of the Serbs &quot; make the NATO bombardments groundless. &quot; He told Russia ' s Interfax news_agency that Yeltsin ' s plan &quot; provides an opportunity to avoid an international conflict which could come_about if the threat of air strikes materialized. &quot; Churkin , speaking on Russian television Thursday night , said he is certain the Serbs will withdraw fully from Sarajevo . He said the NATO ultimatum should be canceled . &quot; There will be no need for air strikes in Bosnia because there will be no objects to bomb , &quot; he said . Russian leaders have consistently opposed NATO air_attacks and complained about not being consulted before last week ' s ultimatum . The United Nations ' Aikman declined to specify what weapons were sighted in the evacuating convoys . Nor would he say where observers believed the arms were being taken . But he said that at the current pace , the Serb rebels could complete withdrawal from the exclusion zone within 36 hours -- well ahead of the deadline set by NATO . In Washington , President Clinton said NATO is determined to force compliance with its ultimatum , but he expressed hope that the crisis is easing . &quot; I hope the air strikes will not be necessary , and they will not occur if the Serbs will comply , &quot; Clinton told reporters . And U.S. officials reacted cautiously to Yeltsin ' s offer of troops for Sarajevo . The United States has frequently tried to enlist Russian support to show solidarity between the world ' s major nuclear_powers . However , most Russians are far more sympathetic to the Serbs , with whom they share ethnic and religious backgrounds , than to the rest of the international community . So the presence of Russian troops could complicate NATO ' s tough talk to the Serbs . Meanwhile , NATO defense ministers agreed to meet at Aviano air_base in Italy on Sunday , just before the alliance deadline . The base would be an important one if air strikes were ordered . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry will attend , meeting with the defense ministers of Britain , France , the_Netherlands and Italy and with Gen . George Joulwan , the NATO commander , and Adm . Jeremy Boorda , head of the NATO air armada . Perry will be accompanied by Gen . John Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff . The U.N. reports of Serbian efforts to comply with the ultimatum came amid accusations by the Muslim-led Bosnian government that the rebels have been burying heavy weaponry on Mt . Trebevic , the Serb-held high ground at the southeastern edge of the city_center . Vice_President Ejup Ganic told reporters that the Bosnian Serbs were &quot; digging holes. &quot; &quot; They ' re trying to defuse the deadline , &quot; Ganic alleged . The Bosnian government has made no secret of its eagerness for Western military intervention to drive Serb forces_back from the gun_emplacements that surround the capital . Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic has said NATO action would provide &quot; a balance of force &quot; that would lead to liberation of Sarajevo and re-establishment of government control over a considerable swath of central Bosnia . Bosnian Serbs loyal to the Belgrade government in the rump Yugoslavia have conquered and occupied 70 % of Bosnia since taking_up arms against this republic ' s 1992 vote for independence . Bosnian Serb military commanders had vowed to defy the NATO ultimatum , claiming withdrawal would be tantamount_to &quot; capitulation. &quot; And in a possible sign of internal conflicts about how to respond to the West ' s ultimatum , a senior Bosnian Serb officer in an interview published Thursday reiterated threats to take foreign_aid workers and journalists hostage in retaliation for any air strikes . The rebel posture changed , at least publicly , after the Karadzic-Churkin meeting . The U.N. reports of departing Serb convoys came as mobs of Sarajevans returned to the streets , reveling in the relative serenity that has followed the ultimatum and the first cease-fire of the war to last more_than a_few hours . As the countdown to Monday ' s deadline continued , even as NATO fighter jets screeched over the city in ear-splitting acts of intimidation , the public mood seemed more cynical than anticipatory . Most people are so consumed by the daily shortages of food , water and electricity that few are concentrating_on the pronouncements of the West , said Haris Pasovic , head of a theater troupe . &quot; Hoping too_much is not good for our stomachs , &quot; he said , alluding to earlier Western threats of force that were not followed_through . &quot; People don ' t want to be betrayed anymore. &quot; In packed streets , children sledded in fresh snow , women marched_out to get jugs of water , and dozens packed the few remaining cafes for sugarless Turkish_coffee . Some , like Selma Rizvic , claimed to be winning the fight for normalcy and dignity among the horrors . &quot; The problem isn ' t that we ' re hungry , &quot; said the 26-year-old computer_graphics artist . &quot; The problem is that we know what it is like to live normally . We ' re not wild animals. &quot; Kirka reported from Sarajevo , Williams from Ancona , Italy . Times staff writers Richard Boudreaux in Moscow and Norman Kempster in Washington contributed to this article .</TEXT>
