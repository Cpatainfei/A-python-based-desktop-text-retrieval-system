   <TEXT> Army doctors , trying to stop the spread of smallpox and other contagious_diseases around frontier forts in the early 19th Century , started vaccinating Indians . That was the first federal health service delivered to the tens of thousands of Native_Americans . &quot; But it was done to protect the soldiers , not the Indians , &quot; said Patricia A . DeAsis , a Cherokee from Oklahoma , who is communications director at Indian Health Service headquarters in Washington , D.C. When frontier doctor Albert M . Wigglesworth arrived_at the Navajo reservation in the high desert of northeastern Arizona in 1904 , there was no hospital , no nurse and virtually no medical equipment . &quot; I was the only physician for some 30 # 000 Indians on a reservation of 16 million acres -- almost double the area of Connecticut and Massachusetts combined , &quot; he wrote decades later in his memoirs . Lame from an untreated childhood fracture , the young doctor wasn ' t eligible for higher-paying military or U.S. Public Health Service posts . Only the Indian Service was open_to him . &quot; Doc &quot; Wigglesworth , housed on the reservation at old Ft . Defiance , would become the first white &quot; medicine_man &quot; to responsibly serve the largest Native_American tribe . Ninety years later , the Indian Health Service is still fighting to improve the health of Native_Americans and Alaska Natives , which continues to lag well behind that of the U.S. population . Indian death rates for seven major causes are greater than those of the population as_a_whole : alcoholism , 438 % greater ; tuberculosis , 400 % ; diabetes_mellitus , 155 % ; accidents , 131 % ; homicide , 57 % ; pneumonia and influenza , 32 % ; and suicide , 27 % . Heart_diseases and accidents are the two leading killers . The federal comprehensive health_care program , available to the 1.3 million natives belonging_to the 547 federally recognized tribes , is provided by 1 # 100 doctors , 380 dentists , 2 # 600 nurses , 100 physician assistants and numerous allied health_professionals . It operates 42 hospitals and 119 health centers and stations . Proposed cuts_in the $ 1.8-billion Indian Health Service budget were_on the agenda last April when 300 tribal_chiefs met with President Clinton , the first and largest gathering of Indian leaders at the White_House . In May , Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) introduced a bill that would elevate the Indian Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services to a policy-making level equivalent_to that of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Interior_Department . The Native_Americans ' struggle with health_problems is rooted in some of the decades-old diseases and in conflicts between traditional Indian healers and modern Western medicine about how to treat them . As a result , DeAsis said , in many communities a dual , and often confusing , health-care system persists . Navajo medicine_men , or &quot; hatathli , &quot; at first resented the intrusion of doctors like Wigglesworth . Navajo children at that time were sent to schools off the reservation . &quot; It was a terrible mistake , &quot; Wigglesworth wrote , &quot; for they began returning them dying of tuberculosis . &quot; I was frantic . I had no place to keep them . There is no idea of sanitation in the hogans ( earthen Navajo dwellings ) of their families . I had to stand_by and see the infection planted . Now we were reaping the harvest . There had been very little TB on the reservation earlier . Now it was very common. &quot; Wigglesworth demonstrated the importance of sanitation . Even today , DeAsis said , &quot; construction of sanitation facilities has done the most to save lives on the reservations. &quot; Wigglesworth opened the Navajos ' first federal hospital , a 60-bed frame building , and the first tuberculosis sanitarium , with 25 beds . He treated trachoma , a contagious eye_infection that was prevalent among Navajos . In 1909 the Public Health Service conducted a trachoma survey of Native_Americans because of numerous reports of the unusually high incidence of blindness among them . It resulted in a U.S. handbook for trachoma control that has become a global reference . During the 1918 flu epidemic , which killed more_than a half-million Americans and 20 million people worldwide , Wigglesworth and his family fell ill . &quot; I had worked_day and night with dying Indians and it was bitter cold , &quot; he wrote later . &quot; I was anointed for death by one of the missionary priests. &quot; Wigglesworth survived and lived to be 92 . While modern medicine helped improve the health of Native_Americans , it diminished the influence of the traditional healer . Within the last two decades , DeAsis said , the Indian Health Service has tried to bridge this medical gap to enhance healing without interfering with newer treatments . Among Indians , the circle of life -- symbolizing birth , growth into adulthood , old_age , passing_on and rebirth -- is sacred and understood across all tribes . It is an integral part of the Native_American medicine wheel . Wellness is harmony and balance among mind , body , spirit and the natural environment . In modern medicine , the focus is only on the physical , said J . T . Garrett , a Cherokee from North Carolina , who is a traditional healer and a director of health_care administration at Indian Health Service headquarters . &quot; On my reservation and others , we have a place , a room , in our modern hospital for traditional healing , &quot; Garrett said . &quot; Our patient bill of rights says that you can consult a traditional medicine person and bring_in paraphernalia -- herbs , teas , crystals , feathers. &quot; Traditional healers are regarded_as &quot; visiting doctors. &quot; Medicine_men and elders of the Navajo Nation provided clues to a mysterious epidemic that plagued the Four Corners region of the Southwest last year . Rodents were suspected carriers . Pinyon trees had borne their sweet nut all year for only the third time this century , the Navajos said . Residents were warned to stay_away_from pinyon trees , frequented by rodents . Eventually , the disease was identified as hantavirus and traced to deer_mice . Through the decades , the Indian Health Service has developed a recognized community-oriented public health_care model . &quot; Health officials from the Third_World come_to look_at what we have , &quot; DeAsis said .</TEXT>
