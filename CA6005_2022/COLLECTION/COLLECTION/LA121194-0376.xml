   <HEADLINE> WEEKEND ESCAPE : COAST STARLIGHT ; MY BEAUTIFUL ROOMETTE ; AMTRAK ROLLS TO SEATTLE WITH SCENERY AND STYLE , THOUGH THE BERTHS COULD USE A LITTLE DEBUNKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> My wife , Martha , is a Midwesterner , for whom railroads had always been a prosaic means of getting from one place to another . She was dubious when I proposed the weekend trip : a ride_on the Coast Starlight train from Los Angeles to Seattle , with a quick return flight on a jetliner . I am a Westerner , for whom any train ride is a rare and romantic adventure . I argued enthusiastically that the two-day journey by rail would be fun , taking us past some of the most spectacular scenery in the West . In the end , I won . Sort of . We decided to go , but she got the lower bunk . Our journey began when we were dropped_off one sunny morning at Los Angeles ' Union Station , the splendid , 55-year-old Spanish-Mediterranean railway terminal restored recently to much of its original glory . Martha travels heavy , and I was staggering up the platform ramp with her weekend supply of clothing , books and other treasures when a robust man named Greg , who turned_out to be our porter , came_to my rescue . Helping me with the bags , Greg found our car and ushered us inside . Our spotlessly clean , stainless_steel Amtrak car was a double-decker . There were toilets , a shower , baggage racks and several bedrooms on the first_floor and another dozen or so bedrooms on the top floor . After stashing our luggage , Greg led us to the tiny first-floor room -- 6 1 / 2-feet long and 3 1 / 2-feet wide -- that would be our home for the next two days . Human dimensions are important when deciding what kind of accommodations you want on the train . Amtrak offers a variety of choices ranging from reclining armchairs in a very public coach car to private bedrooms varying in size from the minuscule &quot; economy bedroom &quot; with a toilet down the hall to a much larger &quot; deluxe bedroom &quot; with its own little bathroom . If you choose to sit_up in public , the trip for two , including your plane flight home , will come_to about $ 644 if you avoid the peak seasons , which include the Christmas holidays and most of the late spring and summer ( when it ' s about $ 250 more ) . Add $ 129 for an ecomony bedroom , and another $ 139 on top of that for a deluxe bedroom . The bedrooms are a relatively good_deal because , unlike the chair_car , the price includes all meals on the train . We had compromised on the economy bedroom , which would prove a tight fit for one of us at bedtime . As a daytime parlor it was fine -- two comfortably upholstered chairs the width of the room , facing one another with plenty of legroom between . There were reading lights , niches in which to store things and a fold-down table beneath the window that ran the length of the room . At 9:55 a.m. -- right on_time -- the train slithered out of the station and gathered speed . Within 45 minutes , the trackside warehouses , topless nightclubs , car washes and inflatable backyard pools of the San Fernando Valley were behind us , and we were gliding smoothly through the rugged hills and fertile farmlands of Ventura County . The first call_for lunch in the dining_car next door came at 11:30 , about the time that the train began its 104-mile run_along the oceanfront from the Ventura River to Vandenberg Air_Force Base . Following railroad custom , we were seated at a table for four with a couple we had never met . The four of us chatted amiably as the train flashed past Bates Beach -- the nude beach near Montecito -- before stopping at Santa Barbara . Since our meals were included with our room , Martha and I gorged shamelessly throughout the trip , making_sure every slice of pie was a_la_mode . * After lunch , Martha retreated to our room for a nap and I wandered another car forward to the lounge car , where conversation soon developed between former strangers . Equipped with swivel_chairs and serviced by a snack_bar and tavern on the lower level , the lounge car was an ideal spot from which to view the untamed Pacific shoreline . For 40 unspoiled miles -- from Gaviota , past Point Conception and Point Arguello to the rocket-launching gantries at Vandenberg -- we gazed out at beaches unreachable by public roads . It was just after we turned_back inland -- in a lovely , oak-studded valley carpeted with sun-bleached grass -- that our train came_to an unscheduled halt . &quot; It ' s a hot box , &quot; said J . C . Collins , the train ' s chief of on-board services , explaining that one of the axle bearings on the lead locomotive had overheated and would have to cool_off before we could start again . Everyone took the delay in stride , and I asked Collins if passengers were always so well behaved . He chuckled . &quot; We usually refer to this as the zoo train , &quot; he said . &quot; While the other trains around the country generally cater to older crowds , this one passes_through nine major college towns . The other trains barely have a pulse . This one has a major heartbeat. &quot; After a half-hour delay , we got under way once more , but the hot-box problem continued and we lagged ever further behind schedule . Finally , near the Salinas Valley agricultural town of King City , our train crew admitted defeat and radioed ahead for a replacement locomotive . It was close to nightfall when we started moving again , and Martha and I returned to our room . At our request , Greg converted it into sleeping quarters , flattening_out the two armchairs and pushing them together to make a lower bunk ; then pulling_down an upper bunk from the ceiling . Martha , who was finding train travel a lot more fun than she remembered it , is not very big , and her bunk -- 6 1 / 2 feet long and 2 feet , 4 inches wide -- was quite ample , as was her headroom , which permitted her to sit upright while she read and gazed out the window . I ' m larger -- a tad under 6 feet and about 175 pounds . And my overhead bedtime slot was smaller , kind of like those on World_War_II U-boats . My bunk was long enough , but it was only 2 feet wide , and felt even narrower . With my left shoulder against the wall , my right extended_to the metal edge of the bunk . I had to either pile my arms atop myself like cordwood or let one dangle , like a pendulum . The top-bunk headroom was only about 2 1 / 2 feet , too low to sit upright . No window up there , either . But I slept , at least intermittently , while the train passed_through Oakland , Sacramento and Redding . At 5 a.m. , I was ready to get_up . I managed to clamber down without awakening Martha , but to get my shoes out from under her lower bunk , I had to sprawl face down in the aisle outside our room and reach back through the door . Fortified with a cup of the coffee that Greg had brewed and left for us , I went_to the lounge car , where some_other early risers and I watched a stunning sunrise behind the snow-covered slopes of Mt . Shasta . Most of the day was spent descending through the magnificent , forested canyons of the Cascade Mountains , again along routes largely unreachable by public road . At 5:30 p.m. we reached Portland , then crossed the Columbia_River and the border into the state of Washington . Because we were running more_than two hours late -- and would reach our destination after most restaurants had closed -- Amtrak treated us to an extra dinner . The sun was vanishing into the southern reaches of Puget Sound when we passed_through Tacoma , and it was_after 10 p.m. when we finally got_to Seattle . We could have caught a late-night flight back to Los Angeles , completing the whole trip in less than 48 hours . But we had decided to spend the night in Seattle and had booked a spacious , handsomely appointed room at the reasonably priced Inn at the Market , a 65-room hotel with European flair overlooking the waterfront . The next morning , Martha checked_out some of the shops along 4th Avenue while I prowled the fish , flower and vegetable markets at the foot of Pike Street . After stuffing ourselves with salmon and crab at one of the agreeable touristy seafood restaurants on Pier 59 , we settled into a cab for the 20-minute ride to SeaTac Airport , and the pleasantly uneventful , 2 1 / 2-hour flight home ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Budget_for Two Coast Starlight , Los Angeles to Seattle , with return flight : $ 773.00 Inn at the Market , one night : $ 125.00 Breakfast , Seattle : $ 17.43 Taxis : $ 27.00 Tips : $ 24.00 Final Tab : $ 966.43 Amtrak , ( 800 ) 872-7245 ; Inn at the Market , 86 Pine St. , Seattle , Wash . 98101 ; tel .
