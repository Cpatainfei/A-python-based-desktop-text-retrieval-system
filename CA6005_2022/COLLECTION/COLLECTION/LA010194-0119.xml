   <HEADLINE> SECOND PEST THREATENS STATE VINEYARDS ; VITICULTURE : THE SHARPSHOOTER NOT ONLY FEEDS_ON YOUNG VINES , BUT ALSO SERVES AS A CARRIER FOR A HARMFUL BACTERIUM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s wine industry , still hurting from the root-eating pest phylloxera , now faces a threat from a bug that is spreading a deadly microbe through vineyards . The new pest is a quarter-inch-long insect called the sharpshooter , which is attacking vineyards in the wine country north of San Francisco . The insect feeds_on many different plants , including young grapevines , sucking the sap . It does not kill the plants directly but carries xylella fastidiosa , a bacterium that causes many maladies , including the fatal Pierce ' s disease . Pierce ' s disease , once called Anaheim disease , destroyed virtually all_the vineyards in Orange County earlier in the century . In recent years it has affected vines in San Diego County , but this is apparently the first time it has hit Northern California . &quot; It is the viticultural problem we have the highest anxiety about , &quot; said Mike Walsh , owner of Walsh Vineyard Management in Napa . About 200 acres of the 1 # 800 acres of vineyard he manages are seriously affected by Pierce ' s disease , and the problem may be more widespread than previously believed . &quot; The especially disturbing thing is that the disease is particularly hard on young vines , and we have new vineyards in many of the most problematic areas , &quot; he said . The sharpshooter is the latest problem to hit California ' s wine industry . For the past 10 years , growers have had to cope_with phylloxera , a tiny , aphid-like louse that has killed thousands of acres of vines . Increased competition , scarcity of credit and a drop_in wine consumption have also harmed the industry . The sharpshooter is worrisome because it is impossible to kill all_the insects in an area . It tends to affect vines next to brush and forests , so some growers are trying to control the pest by cutting_back wild growth along the edges of their vineyards . Researchers hope to determine whether some rootstocks might resist Pierce ' s disease as they do phylloxera . There is some evidence that is the case , said Andrew Walker , a rootstock breeder and assistant_professor of plant genetics at University of California , Davis . Walker is helping set_up a series of rootstock experiments . &quot; It ' s very hard to get funding during periods of low Pierce ' s disease incidence for trials like this , but we ' re seeing lots of interest these days , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
