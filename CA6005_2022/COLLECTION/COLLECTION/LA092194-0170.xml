   <TEXT> When Jean-Claude ( Baby Doc ) Duvalier was driven from power in Haiti eight years ago , he and his family slid into luxurious exile here on the sunny Cote d ' Azur , the sort of place where an out-of-work dictator could spend a lifetime of accumulated wealth . They had a hillside villa with gated privacy and sumptuous views of the Mediterranean . They ate_at the best restaurants , where Duvalier ' s &quot; passion for the table , &quot; as one chef put it , was appreciated almost as much as his ability to pick_up the $ 1 # 000 checks for his entourage . Of course , there also were private tennis_lessons , drives through the Alps in the family Ferrari Testarossa or BMW and expensive visits to the toniest shops in Paris and nearby Cannes . But the free-spending days are gone now . Duvalier is , by all accounts , strapped for cash . His life is a shambles . And his spectacular fall is a warning to any of Haiti ' s outgoing leaders pondering a life of deluxe exile in France . No matter how strong their cultural ties with France , they won ' t be welcome here . And no matter how vast their cash reserve , it may_not be enough . Duvalier , the round-faced president who ran Haiti for 15 bloody years after the death of his notorious father , had managed to spirit more_than $ 120 million out of the impoverished nation by the time he fled , lawyers say . Yet , these days , Duvalier runs from creditors , his assets frittered_away , stolen by friends or entangled . Kicked_out of two Riviera villas in recent years for not paying his rent , Duvalier has landed in a crumbling stone house , sans sea view , in the_hills above Cannes . The phone has been cut_off because of unpaid bills . Even though the former strongman reportedly does the gardening in lieu of rent , the yard grows wild , a blight on the otherwise well-manicured neighborhood . On Tuesday , Duvalier ' s two ragged Pekingese terriers crawled through a hole in the wooden gate to yap at a rare visitor . Inside the house , a small Haitian woman paused from doing dishes to answer the doorbell . Describing herself as &quot; a friend of Monsieur Duvalier , &quot; she said he was visiting Paris , though reporters have seen him on the grounds in recent days . Duvalier ' s wife , Michele , who once spent $ 600 # 000 in a single year on jewelry and Givenchy dresses in Paris , has divorced him . Now married to a Frenchman , she has taken the Duvaliers ' two children , Nicolas , 10 , and Anya , 8 , to live_in a seafront apartment in Cannes . Duvalier now lives with his 82-year-old mother , widow of the former dictator Francois ( Papa Doc ) Duvalier . Today , Jean-Claude Duvalier , 43 , whom headline writers on the Riviera call &quot; Bebe Doc , &quot; remains an embarrassment for the_French and , to a large extent , a prisoner of his need for cash and his uncertain immigration status . When he was driven from power on Feb . 7 , 1986 -- after hosting a champagne farewell for his friends at the Presidential Palace in the capital , Port-au-Prince -- Duvalier arrived in France aboard a U.S. Air_Force jet , with American assurances that he would stay no more_than eight days . It had taken the promise of exile in France to get Duvalier to agree to leave . France accepted him in hopes of preventing a blood bath in Haiti , but only on the condition that his stay be temporary . Finding no country willing to take him , the_French government ordered his expulsion and even tried to put the Duvalier family on a plane for New York . But France backed_down when the United States said it would refuse to accept Duvalier but would continue searching for a more permanent place of exile . A long list of countries refused . When Liberia , despite pressure from the United States , declined , the_French gave_up hope of getting_rid_of Duvalier . A French court eventually overturned the expulsion order , giving him temporary residence in this region . His request for refugee status was denied . A year ago , facing two large lawsuits for unpaid rent , Duvalier was said to be contemplating a return to Haiti . He ran_up a huge telephone_bill -- still unpaid -- in pursuit of that goal , according to associates . But in the end , he decided against a return and moved_into his current villa , L ' Hamadryade , owned by an English businessman . The French Interior Ministry refuses to comment on Duvalier , whose situation differs little from that of the African despots who stole millions from former French colonies and were welcomed here in the past . France ' s association with Haiti dates to 1697 , when the territory became a French possession . Haiti won independence in 1804 . The Duvalier family controlled Haiti for almost 30 years . When Francois Duvalier took_control of the country in 1957 , succeeding a military strongman , Jean-Claude was 6 years old . The elder Duvalier established a dictatorship and ran a notorious secret_police force known as the Tontons Macoutes , who gunned_down opponents of his regime ; he turned the country into the poorest in the Western_Hemisphere . Jean-Claude , meantime , went_to law_school in Haiti and upon the death of his father in 1971 became &quot; president-for-life &quot; at the age of 19 . At first , &quot; Baby Doc , &quot; as he was derisively dubbed , made moves to ease repression in the country , releasing some political_prisoners and receiving new American aid as a reward . But repression and corruption eventually returned . Duvalier and his wife , Michele , who came from a prominent family , lived a lavish lifestyle that stood_in sharp contrast to the rest of the country . His taste for pornographic videos , fast cars and French champagne , and her penchant for French dresses and expensive jewelry , bred broad resentment among Haiti ' s 6 million people . In the mid-1980s , anti-government riots in the streets marked the beginning of the end of the Duvalier reign . At age 35 , Duvalier fled to France . France ' s failure to get_rid_of him , and the anger many French felt at being made the dumping ground for the despot , is one reason that few in the conservative government are eager to play host to any of Haiti ' s current rulers . To the_French , Haiti has become an American problem . &quot; I would rather we didn ' t accept any of them , &quot; said Charles Pasqua , the_French minister of the Interior . &quot; that ' s not our job . Why won ' t the Americans accept them ? It is the Americans who wanted to intervene in Haiti . Why don ' t they pay the price ? Their country is larger than ours. &quot; During Duvalier ' s early years on the Cote d ' Azur , the Haitian government hired lawyers and investigators to search for his fortune , much of which was taken_out of the country by friends and associates in suitcases stuffed with cash , then deposited in England , Switzerland and Luxembourg . It was clear that Duvalier had plenty of money . Although he tried to stay out of the limelight , he and his wife were known around Cannes and Paris for their shopping excursions -- and their penchant for cash purchases . Court records list dozens of large purchases in the late 1980s , including a $ 200 # 000 pair of earrings . Duvalier spent much of his time at sports_car auctions . In Duvalier ' s rare interviews , he has portrayed himself as a victim of his ungrateful homeland and of French anger over his presence . But , in a 1988 interview with Le Figaro magazine in Paris , he admitted , &quot; I ruined myself with the people of Haiti. &quot; In 1988 , two years after Duvalier arrived in France , lawyers for Haiti won a key victory against him . A British court_ordered the seizure of Duvalier ' s account in one London bank . But a week before , the money -- $ 21 # 325 , 615 -- had been transferred to Luxembourg . According to court documents , that money , along with $ 400 # 000 in four other London banks , was transferred on orders from Michele Duvalier ' s brother . Members of her family were accused of massive corruption during their years in Haiti . &quot; We will always have our suspicions that someone tipped them off , &quot; said Jacques Sales , a Haitian-born attorney in Paris who led the fight for Duvalier ' s millions . After that disappointment , Sales said the Haitian government &quot; gave_up . They had hoped that everything would be over in a matter of weeks . And when they realized it would take years and that they might not even be in power when it was found , they kind of lost interest. &quot; So , with Duvalier now apparently broke , what happened to all his money ? Attorneys involved in the case say some of it probably was taken by Duvalier ' s associates , who served as middlemen between European banks and Duvalier ' s French villa . Other money may have been taken by Michele Duvalier , whose relatives controlled some of the accounts . Some , undoubtedly , still sits in foreign accounts , waiting for Duvalier to collect it . &quot; Not even Duvalier could spend more_than $ 20 million like that , overnight , &quot; Sales said . Some who remember Duvalier ' s brutal style of rule , and his denials that he stole money from the Haitian people , think Duvalier just wants to appear poor now , in hopes of winning sympathy for a return to Haiti . No one knows for_sure how much money Duvalier has , though his days of conspicuous_consumption have ended . He is being sued by one lawyer for non-payment of fees . His staff has dwindled to one Pakistani servant , who reportedly has been reduced to begging neighbors for extra work . Duvalier ' s attempt to buy a Mercedes recently was turned_down by a car_dealer who demanded cash . He could be living_on the $ 1.2-million proceeds from the 1992 sale of his 20-room chateau near Paris . He bought the chateau , on 25 wooded acres , during his rule_in Haiti in the hope that he would live there one day . But when he arrived in France in 1986 , regional authorities refused to allow him to move_in , citing his human_rights record ; the government blocked the chateau ' s sale . After a protracted court battle and huge legal_fees , the sale was allowed . The regional government bought the property , paying about half what Duvalier had paid , to turn it into a nature preserve . The Haitian government , in disarray , declined to appeal the decision . Attorneys figure there could be as much as $ 10 million , and perhaps a good_deal more , in other countries . But Duvalier can ' t leave France , for fear he will not be allowed to return . In any case , no other country is likely to grant him entry . With Haiti in disarray , though , the search for that money has ended -- for the moment , at least . &quot; We wanted to try to get_hold_of that money for the people of Haiti , &quot; said Sales , who has represented the Haitian government in France . &quot; But when we saw that year after year the governments in Haiti changed , one bad government being succeeded by a worse government , we finally realized that , even if we found the money , it would have just been returned to the thugs who were running Haiti . The Haitian people will never see it. &quot;</TEXT>
