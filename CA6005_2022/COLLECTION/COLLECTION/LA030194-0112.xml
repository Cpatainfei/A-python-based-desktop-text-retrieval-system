   <HEADLINE> MURDERER CALLED ' PREDATOR AND BOTTOM FEEDER ' ; SENTENCING : PROSECUTOR TELLS JURY THE CONVICTED KILLER OF A FOUNTAIN VALLEY WOMAN DESERVES TO BE EXECUTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A convicted murderer with a long history of violence and sexual_assaults was described by a prosecutor Monday as a &quot; predator and bottom feeder &quot; who deserves to die for his crimes . Timothy DePriest , 33 , who is already serving a life sentence in another state , showed little emotion during closing arguments in Orange County Superior_Court . Jurors must recommend whether he should serve a life sentence or be put_to_death for the December , 1989 , robbery , attempted rape and murder of a Fountain Valley mother . Deputy Public_Defender Lewis W . Clapp asked jurors to spare the life of his client , who suffered an abusive upbringing , mental problems and personality_disorders . But Deputy Dist . Atty . Christopher J . Evans told jurors that DePriest never showed his victims any mercy . Hong Thi Nguyen , 26 , who worked as a seamstress at a Garden Grove bridal shop , was &quot; beaten like a rag_doll &quot; before DePriest shot her in the head and dumped her naked body alongside a trash_bin behind a pharmacy , Evans said . DePriest was convicted of those crimes on Feb . 5 . Evans told jurors that Nguyen risked her life to escape Communist rule_in Vietnam and worked hard to seek a better life for her family , only to fall victim to senseless crime . &quot; He is a predator and bottom feeder , &quot; Evans said , telling jurors that DePriest has &quot; earned &quot; the death_penalty . &quot; He enjoys the crimes that he does , he does_it over and over for the fun of it. &quot; During his closing argument , Clapp criticized Evans ' descriptions of DePriest as unfair name calling used to dehumanize DePriest so jurors could more easily condemn him . Clapp asked jurors to look_into their &quot; hearts of hearts &quot; while recalling DePriest ' s abusive upbringing and psychiatric reports about his mental defects , as well as the defendant ' s mother , who abandoned her son as a youngster and later used drugs with him as he became older . &quot; The choice belongs_to you , &quot; Clapp said . At the time of Nguyen ' s murder , DePriest was_on parole in California for an earlier rape . He stole Nguyen ' s car after killing her , skipped parole and went_to Missouri . There , DePriest sexually assaulted a woman and shot and wounded a police_officer who tried to catch him . He was sentenced in Missouri to life in prison plus 57 years . While jurors will make a sentencing recommendation , the final_decision will be made by Orange County Superior_Court Judge Everett W . Dickey . If DePriest is sentenced to life in prison , it is unclear in which state he would serve his sentence first . If sentenced to death , DePriest will join other inmates on death row in California .</TEXT>
