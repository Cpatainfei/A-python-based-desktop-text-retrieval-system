   <HEADLINE> 2 PLEAD INNOCENT IN HONDA CASE ; COURTS : THE FORMER EXECUTIVES , ONE A LAGUNA HILLS MAN , ARE ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING THE CAR FIRM OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN KICKBACK SCHEME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two former American Honda Motor Co . executives , accused in a kickback scheme that allegedly defrauded the company of millions of dollars , pleaded innocent Thursday in U.S. District Court here . Lawyers for former Senior_Vice_President S . James Cardiges , 48 , of Laguna Hills , called Cardiges a scapegoat but declined to elaborate . &quot; We ' re confident the evidence will ultimately show that Jim Cardiges didn ' t defraud anyone , including American Honda , &quot; said his lawyer , Philip Israels of Sherman Oaks . Cardiges is charged with racketeering . Damien Budnick , 45 , of Orlando , Fla. , pleaded innocent to conspiracy to commit mail_fraud . Indictments against the two men and three others charge them with accepting cash and gifts , including Rolex watches , luxury cars , furniture , real_estate and , in Cardiges ' case , 10 $ 1 # 000 business_suits . Investigators allege that the kickbacks were part of a scheme involving 30 to 40 of Honda ' s hundreds of U.S. dealers . The allegations , spanning the years from 1979 to 1992 and involving roughly $ 10 million , include people paying as much as $ 750 # 000 for the right to open dealerships for Hondas and the company ' s luxury Acura cars . In other cases , dealers paid to get larger allocations of popular models and executives got kickbacks from inflated payments for advertising and training , prosecutors said . The others charged are John Billmyer of Raleigh , N.C. , David Pedersen of Roswell , Ga. , and Dennis Josleyn of Penn Valley , Calif . They are to be arraigned within the next two weeks . All five were arrested last month . Eight other former Honda sales executives have pleaded guilty to fraud- and bribery-related charges , including conspiracy . U.S. District Magistrate William Barry set a trial date of June 7 for Cardiges and Budnick , who remain free on bail . Cardiges was the top U.S. sales executive in the Honda division of American Honda . His lawyers say he is now in private business but would not say where or what he does . During Cardiges ' arrest , FBI_agents seized corporate , banking and financial records from his home , as well as some gifts he allegedly accepted from Honda dealers . On Thursday , Assistant U.S. Atty . Michael Connolly said Cardiges ' lawyers looked through the boxes of material and removed documents they say are protected under the attorney-client_privilege . Connolly said he wants to check what was taken_to ensure that it is privileged and asked Barry to bar defense_lawyers from alleging that the evidence is tainted if the government examines it . Cardiges ' lawyers refused to go_along , however , and Barry sided with them . Connolly thus must trust the defense or check the evidence and risk not being able to use it . &quot; You ' re on the horns of a dilemma , sir , &quot; Barry told Connolly . &quot; that ' s one of the perils of the job of a U.S. attorney. &quot; The yearlong investigation was prompted by a civil lawsuit filed_in 1991 by a New Hampshire Acura dealer , Richard Nault . Nault alleged that American Honda forced him out of business by failing to deliver all_the cars he had been promised . The suit was settled for a reported $ 5 million last year , but U.S. District Judge Steven McAuliffe ordered an investigation of the bribery allegations .</TEXT>
