   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ' S CABAL : FROM RAGS TO RICHES TO WORLDWIDE MANHUNT ; PROFILE : HIS STORY WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A FAIRY TALE , MANY SAY . AUTHORITIES WANT TO KNOW WHERE HE GOT THE POT OF GOLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was not merely a rags-to-riches fairy tale when Carlos Cabal Peniche suddenly emerged on the stage of international finance this year as &quot; a corporate wizard , &quot; a relative unknown who had built a $ 1-billion fortune from less than nothing in just six years . Until this week , Cabal , at age 38 , had become a symbol of the modern Mexican dream . He was heir to nothing more_than a bankrupt chain of department_stores called Tu Casa ( &quot; Your House &quot; ) in the southern Mexican state of Tabasco . But he used his government ' s radical economic reform policies , a network of loyal , influential friends and his own considerable wiles to buy banks , hotels , plantations and -- almost -- one of the world ' s largest fruit and vegetable processors . Most Mexicans saw in his life the ultimate , seemingly unattainable rise from their country ' s virtually endemic poverty to a magic , instant prosperity . On Wednesday , however , Cabal was a fugitive , the subject of an international manhunt . Federal_agents were pursuing him and several of his fellow directors on indictments accusing them of participating in one of Mexico ' s biggest bank frauds . Authorities have said they ran an insider-lending scheme in which Cabal siphoned as much as $ 700 million from two major Mexican banks using ghost companies . As the drama played_out on television_news shows , on newspapers ' front pages and in endless conversations -- from the glass-and-steel towers in Mexico_City ' s financial district to the gritty street cafes of Tabasco , where Cabal began building his empire -- his story , many here said , was nothing less than an old-fashioned fable . &quot; Everybody is talking_about this , and what everyone is saying is , ' I guess it doesn ' t pay to get rich_in a hurry , ' &quot; said Jonathan Heath , a prominent Mexico_City financial analyst . &quot; That , I think , is the moral of the whole thing. &quot; In announcing the criminal charges against Cabal and his corporate directors Monday , Finance_Minister Pedro Aspe said the government was seizing Cabal ' s Grupo Financiero Union and its subsidiaries to protect investors and depositors in the group ' s two banks , Banco Union and Banca Cremi . But the scandal ' s effects are likely to be broader . Privately , many analysts here said the case could affect all_of Mexico ' s smaller , recently privatized banks , particularly if depositors shift their savings to larger institutions on the assumption that they are better-managed . The greatest sting , though , will be felt in Tabasco , where officials estimated that more_than half of all private investment is through Cabal ' s companies . State officials described the Cabal case as &quot; a powerful blow &quot; that &quot; will hurt the local economy. &quot; It was in Tabasco and its capital , Villahermosa , where young Cabal achieved legendary status during his heyday of corporate acquisitions . &quot; Six years ago , the daily gossip in the gambling room of the Cafe Casino in Villahermosa began with the question , ' What did Carlos Cabal Peniche buy today ? ' &quot; Miguel Angel Granados Chapa , a columnist at the respected Mexico_City daily La Reforma , recalled Wednesday . Cabal ' s career of high-stakes wheeling and dealing coincided with the beginning of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s term . It was a time when Mexico ' s president launched a new era of radical privatization , in which vast government resources were auctioned_off -- often with little subsequent government oversight -- to entrepreneurs . Cabal , by all accounts , began to win attention in 1988 , when he first appeared as the new owner-administrator of a large Tabasco plantation , San Carlos del Golfo , which exported pineapples , melons and avocados to the United States , Canada , Germany , New Zealand and Southeast_Asia . As a plantation_owner , Cabal befriended powerful former governors and members of other influential Mexican political families , forming partnerships with them in later , major corporate purchases , according to recent Mexican news_reports and corporate documents . But the information available on Cabal on Wednesday was unclear on just how he and his fellow investors got the capital to buy , within just a_few years : the bank that later became Banco Union , for $ 200 million ; Banca Cremi , for $ 560 million , and Florida-based Del Monte Fresh Produce , for $ 574 million . Where , too , did Cabal and his backers get the capital for their bid last July for Del Monte Food Corp . of San Francisco , one of the world ' s largest fruit and vegetable processors and exporters ? They were to have put_up $ 277 million in cash and assumed $ 700 million in Del Monte debt . The deal did not go_through .</TEXT>
