   <TEXT> Your factual obituary ( Dec . 23 ) on lifelong Paramount film executive Eugene Zukor , 97 , masks a vivid career hidden by Gene ' s overwhelming modesty . Gene was a small , quiet man , but was assigned by the World_War I Navy to explosives.So ably did Petty_Officer Zukor inventory ammunition and arm ships , he was assigned to report directly to the undersecretary of the Navy , Franklin D . Roosevelt . Shortly after World_War I , Roosevelt wrote a screen treatment about a naval hero and sent it to young Zukor . The treatment was weak . Paramount officials &quot; lost &quot; it . But Roosevelt hounded Zukor about it , and Zukor had to write an apology , still preserved at the F.D.R. Hyde Park Library . Years later , Roosevelt was President and spotted Gene at an Oval Office press_conference . The President interrupted the action to call him forward and to again ask about the treatment . Gene artfully told his President that it was not rejected ; it was &quot; in limbo. &quot; An important stock investor , Gene feared the speculative fever of the 1920s and sold_out before the ' 29 crash . He left the East for Hollywood where he assisted his father Adolph in guiding Paramount out of receivership . Gene remained active with the Navy and was transferred in World_War_II from its Los Angeles public relations office to the Bureau of Personnel in Washington . There , this man of integrity was consulted on commissioning Hollywood people for film and PR assignments . Gene knew so_much inside_information that my father , producer Sol Lesser , arranged publication for Gene ' s writing an authentic history of Paramount . But Gene balked . He would not reveal sleaze he had learned in confidence . This man , who chose to live and die here , left a pattern other Angelenos can admire . JULIAN ( BUD ) LESSER Los Angeles</TEXT>
