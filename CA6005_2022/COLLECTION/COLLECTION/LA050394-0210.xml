   <HEADLINE> PERRY BACKS U.N. MISSION IN RWANDA ; AFRICA : THE DEFENSE_SECRETARY PROMISES U.S. SUPPORT BUT NOT TROOPS . THE STATE_DEPARTMENT DISPATCHES TWO ENVOYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Defense_Secretary William J . Perry on Monday endorsed a proposal for a U.N. military_expedition to stop massacres in Rwanda and promised American support -- short of combat troops -- for such a venture . Describing the carnage in the tiny Central African_country as &quot; a world-scale humanitarian tragedy , &quot; Perry told Times reporters at a breakfast meeting here that U.N. Security_Council action to reduce the bloodshed there should be &quot; a top priority. &quot; His remarks amounted to the first positive response by the Clinton_Administration to a call Friday from Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a large U.N. force to quell the frenzied ethnic conflict in Rwanda . Because the United States has veto power , American support , or at least acquiescence , is vital for any new Security_Council action . Yet even as thousands more terrified refugees flowed_from Rwanda into a squalid camp in Tanzania , it remained unclear what the Security_Council could or would do_in the crisis . The State_Department , which dispatched two envoys to the area , focused its energies on trying to arrange a cease-fire rather than galvanizing the Security_Council into launching a large peacekeeping operation . The warfare , which may have killed as_many as 200 # 000 Rwandans , began a month ago after the Hutu presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi died in a mysterious plane crash . The vast majority of refugees in Tanzania have been members of the Hutu tribe fleeing the Rwandan Patriotic Front , a rebel army dominated by warring Tutsis . The rebels have nearly encircled the capital of Kigali and seized huge slabs of territory , including the border with Tanzania . White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that John Shattuck , assistant secretary_of_state for humanitarian affairs , and David Rawson , the U.S. ambassador to Rwanda , would depart shortly to discuss the crisis with Secretary_General Salim Ahmed Salim of the Organization of African Unity and other officials in Uganda , Burundi and Tanzania . Shattuck and Rawson hope to revive peace negotiations between the Rwandan government and the rebels . One of the most commonly discussed suggestions for a solution to the crisis -- an expeditionary force of African troops set_up by the United Nations and the OAU -- was belittled by Kofi Annan of Ghana , the U.N. undersecretary general in_charge of peacekeeping , at an unusual briefing of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Africa . &quot; Given the limitations of the OAU , if we want urgent and immediate action , I ' m not sure that is the organization to turn_to , &quot; Annan said Monday . &quot; The only African_country that could . . . contain the situation and help bring_about law and order probably would be South_Africa , but it ' s too soon to turn_to them. &quot; The South_African government is undergoing reorganization following historic all-race elections . Further , Annan said , any troops dispatched to Rwanda would have to depend_on the American military to get them there . &quot; The United States is one of the few countries . . . able to move . . . assets that can get people into situations like that very quickly , &quot; he said . Perry echoed the sentiment , saying that -- although combat duty in Rwanda is more appropriate for U.N. forces than U.S. troops -- &quot; U.S. forces might . . . be called_upon to provide some special resources , some areas where we have special capabilities &quot; -- for example , a &quot; specialized airlift. &quot; The Washington Post , in a graphic report from the Tanzanian border , told of scores of mutilated , bloated corpses floating down the Kagera River and over the Rusumo Falls . Reporter Keith B . Richburg also wrote_of how Tanzanian authorities had created a huge pile of machetes and knives , which they collected from refugees before they were allowed to enter the country . Before the outbreak of violence , the United Nations had stationed 2 # 500 troops in Rwanda . The Security_Council voted 12 days ago to reduce the number to 270 . About 450 U.N. peacekeepers are still in Rwanda . But on Friday , Boutros-Ghali asked the Security_Council to expand the force to a size large enough to quell the violence .</TEXT>
