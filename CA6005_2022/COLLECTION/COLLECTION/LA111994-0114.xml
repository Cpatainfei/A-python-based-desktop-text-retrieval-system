   <HEADLINE> QUEBEC DROPS DAM PLANS ; INDIANS HAD FOUGHT PROJECT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Quebec government suspended plans Friday for a controversial dam on the Great Whale River in northern Quebec , a project that has been the focus of international environmental protests led by the Cree Indians who live along the river . Addressing a conference here of the American Council for Quebec Studies , a U.S. academic group , provincial Tourism Minister Rita Dionne-Marsolais said the Great Whale project is &quot; no longer a priority &quot; for the Quebec government . She said the decision to shelve the project was based mainly on economics , and she did not rule_out its revival . The announcement was also made in Quebec_City by provincial Premier Jacques Parizeau . Earlier in the day , Matthew Coon Comb , grand chief of the Cree of Quebec and the dam ' s leading critic , appeared at the meeting and attacked the $ 9.75-billion project . Coon Comb has received several major environmental preservation awards for his campaign against the dam , which would flood thousands of acres of the Cree ' s traditional hunting and trapping grounds along the eastern shore of Hudson_Bay and inland . In 1992 , the Cree persuaded the New York Power Authority to cancel a contract with Quebec for electricity . The future of the dam was already in_question because of extensive new environmental reviews . Dionne-Marsolais said it has not been decided whether to go_ahead with those studies . The most immediate impact of Friday ' s announcement may be_on the campaign for Quebec independence . Native communities in the province , which generally support continued union with Canada , have emerged as among the most effective opponents of independence in the forums of international opinion . By seeking to remove the Great Whale dam as an issue , the Parizeau government appears to be trying to nullify a rallying point for international opposition to Quebec separatism . Parizeau was elected Sept . 12 on a platform of independence for the predominantly French-speaking province .</TEXT>
