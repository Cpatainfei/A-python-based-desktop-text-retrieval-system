   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : FALLOUT FROM RISING RATES ; THE FED AND THE MARKETS : WHAT INVESTORS NEED TO KNOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Friday ' s 96.24-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials -- a reaction to the Federal_Reserve ' s first official interest_rate hike since 1989 -- raised concerns about the bull_market ' s future . The Dow ' s plunge was its largest one-day drop_in more_than two years . What should you make of this move ? And should it change your investment plans ? Here are answers to questions stock and bond investors may have in the wake of the Fed ' s action . Question : Why did the stock_market react so badly , when the Fed ' s move had been widely expected ? Answer : That question dogged many pros , who admit that this was perhaps the most anticipated Fed credit-tightening in history . Just last Monday , Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that the strengthening economy would inevitably produce somewhat higher short-term interest_rates . In theory , the Fed ' s move to raise a key short-term interest_rate , the federal funds rate , from 3.0 % to 3.25 % should have been built into stock prices ; the actual announcement on Friday should have prompted investor yawns . The problem may have been one of simple complacency : Whenever too many investors assume the market will act a certain way , it often does the opposite . Also , because stocks had surged to record highs earlier last week -- pulling_in many short-term speculators -- those traders were poised to exit at the first hint of bad news . * Q : But historically , haven ' t stocks dropped whenever interest_rates have risen ? A : That is one of the market ' s biggest myths . The truth is , rising rates generally don ' t end bull_markets -- not in the initial stages of the rate rise , anyway . Typically , as the economy begins to gain steam after a recession , short-term rates rise as consumers and businesses borrow more . But instead of focusing_on the turn_in interest_rates , stock investors usually focus more on the surge in corporate earnings that is a byproduct of a stronger economy . The result is that stock prices and short-term rates often advance together as the economy revs_up . That occurred in 1983 , for example : Three-month Treasury_bill yields rose from 8 % to 9 % with the burgeoning economy , yet the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500-stock index jumped 17 % that year . * Q : How much of a rate rise will it take_to kill the bull_market ? A : There is no set increase that anyone can point to in_advance and say , &quot; This is it. &quot; It ' s unclear how high short-term rates would have to rise , for example , before individual investors would decide that they ' re better_off in a money_market fund than in_stocks , thus reducing the crucial flow of fresh cash into the market . Still , many experts believe that short rates will have to rise significantly more_than the quarter-point increase the Fed has dictated before money funds provide competition for stocks . Money funds ' average yield , now 2.72 % , could rise to 3 % with the Fed move . But that would still be rather paltry . Some Wall_Street analysts , in forecasting bear_markets , look_to the frequency of Fed rate hikes as a guide rather than how much rates rise . One classic rule is &quot; three jumps and a stumble &quot; : Historically , the stock_market often has peaked only after the Fed raises rates three successive times . * Q : If the economy is OK , shouldn ' t stock prices quickly recover ? A : In theory , yes . Many investors feel that little has changed , despite the Fed move . &quot; The economic recovery is real , and corporate profits should show a very nice increase this year , &quot; says Larry Auriana , co-manager of the Kaufmann stock fund in New York . And of course , investors large and small have been conditioned since the 1987 market crash to buy on any dramatic declines -- because prices have rebounded every time . Even now , stock mutual_funds have large cash hoards waiting to be invested ; the funds ' cash holdings equaled nearly $ 60 billion , or 8.5 % of total assets , as 1994 began . What ' s more , stock funds now have a tremendous regular source of incoming cash that many didn ' t have in the ' 80s : money from 401 ( k ) retirement_plans . But again , the problem here may be too_much complacency : Investors expect the market to resurge . If it doesn ' t come_back immediately this morning , potential buyers could continue to wait_on the sidelines -- allowing prices to fall further , which in turn could increase investors ' cautiousness , setting_off an even deeper slide . On Sunday , small investors ' complacency was evident in a report from Fidelity Investments , the nation ' s largest mutual_fund company : Despite Friday ' s market plunge , Fidelity said it got relatively few weekend calls to its toll-free information numbers , from buyers or sellers . &quot; It ' s been a very_light weekend , &quot; said spokeswoman Tracey Gordon . Of course , it ' s heartening that investors weren ' t calling to sell -- but neither were they buying . * Q : What is the worst-case scenar io for stocks ? A : The Fed ' s rate boost could be enough to trigger the first meaningful &quot; correction &quot; in this 39-month-old bull_market . Typically as bull_markets advance , stocks experience periodic selloffs that clip 5 % to 10 % from the Dow index , the S &amp; P 500 and other indexes as investors take profits . In this bull_run , however , the market as_a_whole has yet to give_up more_than 5 % of its advance ( though many individual stocks certainly have done so ) . Precisely because this bull_market has held_up for so_long , the Fed ' s move makes_it vulnerable to a true correction , many experts say . &quot; When the market gets_to be like a coiled_spring , something like this can trigger its release , &quot; says Ralph Wanger , who heads the $ 4-billion Acorn Funds in Chicago . If the Dow were to drop 10 % from its all-time high of 3 # 978.36 last Monday , it would fall another 300 points_after Friday ' s 96.24-point , 2.4 % decline . That would put the index at about 3 # 580 , back to where it was last September . * Q : would n ' t that kind of slide be a definite buying opportunity ? A : Assuming the economy ' s expansion remains on track , the answer is yes , most analysts say . Though stock prices are historically high now , relative to earnings and dividends , a growing economy will boost earnings and thus dividends -- which will make stocks appear much cheaper over time . The risk is that the economy proves much more vulnerable than expected to the relatively small rate increase engineered by the Fed last week . If business_activity were to slump again by spring , the stock_market could be in_trouble . * Q : Which stocks or stock groups could fare best when the market rebounds ? A : If you believe that the economy will continue to grow , many analysts say the stocks to own are the same market stars of 1993 and the first month of this year : industrial issues such_as autos , steel , machinery and other groups that should see greater demand for their products as consumers and businesses spend more . Analysts note that big-name industrial issues in particular could benefit if foreign investors increase their purchases of U.S. stocks . And foreigners may soon have a very good reason to boost their buying here : Higher interest_rates in America have a side_effect of bolstering the dollar ' s value . Indeed , the dollar zoomed to a 2 1 / 2-year high against the German mark on Friday after the Fed rate hike . When the dollar rises in value , it automatically boosts the value of U.S. stocks owned by foreigners -- giving them more incentive to own U.S. securities . * Q : What if I own bonds ? Is it time to sell , if rates are going_up ? A : Generally speaking , it becomes much more difficult to make money in bonds as rates rise , because higher market rates erode the value of existing bonds . Ironically , the investors hurt worst in bonds in recent weeks have been owners of supposedly safer shorter-term issues . Anticipating the Fed ' s rate hike , the market has pushed_up short rates by more_than a quarter point , slicing_into shorter bonds ' values . Long-term yields , in contrast , haven ' t risen nearly as much . And some experts say long-term yields could even drop this spring , despite higher short rates , if investors believe that the Fed ' s efforts to slow the economy will ultimately keep inflation in check . Long-term yields respond more to inflation concerns than anything else . For bond investors who need interest income , the best strategy remains the simplest : Split your investment among short-term , intermediate-term and long-term bonds or bond funds . That will give you maximum flexibility , however interest_rates move from here . How Rates Have Surged The Federal_Reserve officially raised short-term interest_rates on Friday , but the market has been pushing Treasury security yields_up for weeks in anticipation . 04 # 16 , 09 # 08 , 12 Jan . 21 Friday Treasury issue yield yield Change 3-month 3.01 % 3.28 % + 0.27 pts . 6-month 3.21 % 3.47 % + 0.26 pts . 1-year 3.48 % 3.83 % + 0.35 pts . 3-year 4.37 % 4.65 % + 0.28 pts . 5-year 5.04 % 5.30 % + 0.26 pts . 10-year 5.70 % 5.88 % + 0.18 pts . 30-year 6.28 % 6.36 % + 0.08 pts .
