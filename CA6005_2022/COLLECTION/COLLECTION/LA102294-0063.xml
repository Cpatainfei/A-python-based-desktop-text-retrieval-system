   <HEADLINE> TOOLS ; EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN HANDLING CHAIN_SAWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A chain saw can make short work of cutting heavy brush , tree limbs and trees . But it ' s potentially dangerous and should be handled with extreme care . Here are some safety tips : * Plan your work well . Don ' t use your saw in semi-darkness or when fatigue , intoxication or illness may impair your coordination . * Wear heavy gloves , steel-toed work_shoes , safety goggles and a hard_hat . Don ' t wear clothing that is too light or too loose . Use ear plugs if you plan to work with a saw for a long_time . * While cutting , hold the saw firmly with both hands and stand with your feet solidly placed . * Keep others away from your cutting area . * Make_sure the saw is free_of obstructions . Kickbacks from hitting surrounding tree limbs , earth , rocks and other obstacles cause many injuries . * Turn_off the ignition_switch ( or unplug an electric model ) before refueling , touching the chain , or performing any other maintenance or repairs . * After refueling , move at least 10 feet from the spot before starting the saw ; spilled gasoline can easily ignite . Keep a fire_extinguisher handy . * Start your saw on the ground . Then start the chain before making contact with the wood to prevent saw kickback . * Stand to the side of the saw when cutting , never directly behind it . Oil-Gas Mix Most chain_saws are powered by a two-cycle engine that uses a gasoline-oil mix to provide lubrication . It ' s entirely different than the oil used in automobiles or to lubricate the saw ' s chain , and it ' s sold prepackaged to mix with one or two gallons of gasoline . Always mix the oil and gasoline in a separate , clean container . Pour the oil in first , then add some gasoline and slosh it around until thoroughly mixed . Add the rest of the gas and pour the mixture into the saw ' s fuel tank . All saws have either automatic or manual oilers that lubricate the chain . Both types must be refilled frequently with the grade of oil specified by the manufacturer . With the manual oiler , push the oiling button about once every minute while cutting . Check the oil level during use to avoid overheating and damaging the chain . Refueling Brush away any sawdust around the gas cap . Keep the fuel clean by also brushing dirt from the container . Always wipe spilled fuel from the engine housing to avoid a fire hazard and possible fouling of the starter , the engine or the carburetor . Cleaning Keep your chain saw free_of accumulated sawdust . Use a wire or small screwdriver to clean the oil holes in the guide bar and the guide-bar slot . Brush all vents around the engine housing and the muffler to permit efficient cooling . Check the spark_plug before heavy use . If it is heavily coated with oil deposits , replace it . After every five to 10 hours of cutting , clean the cylinder fins with a stiff brush and a vacuum extension tool . Remove the sheet_metal covers and the muffler to reach the fins . Remove the air_filter , wash it in detergent and water , rinse , and dry thoroughly before reinstalling it . Chain Tension Proper chain tension is the key to safe and efficient cutting . Read your owner ' s manual for chain-tension adjustment guidelines . The tension changes due_to heating during operation , stretching and wear . Check the chain tension frequently during cutting , especially the first half-hour . Let the saw cool before changing the tension . If your gas-powered saw stalls often or if the chain moves rapidly along the bar as the engine idles , adjust the idle speed , following your owner ' s manual instructions . Sharpen the chain after every four hours of use . Get a set of special files and gauges and follow the directions in your owner ' s manual .</TEXT>
