   <HEADLINE> APPROVAL TO REBUILD CONTAINS CONDITIONS ; MALIBU : CITY PLAN WOULD EXPEDITE THE PERMIT PROCESS FOR FIRE VICTIMS WHO ASSUME THE LEGAL RISK OF LIVING IN LANDSLIDE AREAS . THOSE WHO REFUSE TO SIGN WAIVERS WOULD HAVE TO CONDUCT GEOLOGICAL TESTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Malibu is offering fire victims in landslide areas a speedier , less costly way to get reconstruction permits -- as long as they assume the legal risk of living on unstable land . If these residents sign liability waivers , the city will allow them to rebuild without having to meet a longstanding requirement that they first conduct geological studies of their property . The waivers , which would indemnify the city against liability for property damage or injuries stemming from landslides , are proving controversial . At a meeting Wednesday , where city officials discussed the issue with about 300 residents , some homeowners said they felt the city was making_it hard for them to rebuild . &quot; I feel betrayed , &quot; said Jody Stump , whose Rambla Vista home was burned to the ground . &quot; We aren ' t seeking a build permit , we are seeking a rebuild permit . I want my house back and this is onerous . I had a perfectly good house . . . and to me , ( the lot ) is no different now. &quot; Said Ron Goldman , a member of a fire victims group advising the city on reconstruction efforts : &quot; All of this has a chilling effect on our ability to get loans , on our resale value and on and on. &quot; City_Manager David Carmany said the City_Council will review the issue at its March 28 meeting . Residents are expected to press for changes , mindful that two council seats are up for election in April . Complicating the rebuilding in Malibu is the geologic status of much of the property burned in the Nov . 2 wildfire . Using state and federal landslide maps , city engineers and a geologist have determined that about 85 % of the 280 residents whose homes burned_down in east Malibu were sitting on potentially active landslides . To protect the city from litigation arising from future slides on such property , city attorneys advised the council to approve the waiver policy . Homeowners who do not sign a waiver must conduct geological surveys that show the land is stable before they can get a permit . Such surveys are required in the building_code the city adopted from the county when it incorporated . The surveys , which involve geologic drilling , could cost a homeowner $ 5 # 000 to $ 50 # 000 , according to residents who have received estimates for the work . Once the survey is complete , the city reviews it and also studies historic geologic information before reaching a final_decision on the permit application . Owners of property that is found to be stable would receive a permit to rebuild and would not be required to sign a liability waiver . Those who own land deemed unsafe would have to take steps to stabilize the land -- shoring_up a hillside , for instance -- before they could receive a permit to rebuild . Many residents at Wednesday ' s meeting said they were being discriminated against because , unlike other fire victims , they must spend time and money to satisfy the city ' s geological approval requirements . Others attacked the city for being vague about what was considered geologically hazardous . Goldman said he worried that residents who sign the waiver could become liable for a wide range of lawsuits against the city . &quot; If you have to sign a waiver . . . and someone downstream from you says they want to sue the city , &quot; said Goldman , &quot; the city will get a notice and they ' re going to ask you what lawyer you ' re going to hire. &quot;</TEXT>
