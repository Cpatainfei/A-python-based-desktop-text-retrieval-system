   <HEADLINE> LOCKHEED ' S F-16 HITS EXPORT TARGETS ; WITH U.S AIR_FORCE ORDERS CURTAILED , THE VERSATILE WARPLANE HAS FOUND NEW CUSTOMERS ABROAD . BUT COMPETITORS HAVE THE SAME TERRITORY IN THEIR SIGHTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For 16 years , the banana-shaped profile of Lockheed Corp. ' s F-16 &quot; Fighting Falcon &quot; has been the pride oS . fighter crews , who nickname the jets and scrub them spotless with orange-scented cleanser . But the F-16 ' s days as an American emblem are waning . Although the U.S. Air_Force has bought 2 # 000 of them -- and recently dispatched 84 to the Persian_Gulf in response to Iraqi troop movements -- it is ending orders this year due_to post-Cold War budget_cuts . So today , most new F-16s coming_off Lockheed ' s Fort_Worth assembly_line are destined for other countries . Over the years , 17 foreign countries , with U.S. approval , have bought the versatile , single-engine warplane . And overseas customers , including Singapore , Egypt , Portugal and Taiwan , now account_for 90 % of Lockheed ' s impressive $ 11-billion F-16 backlog . Some new foreign sales have been controversial , but they have helped make the F-16 one of Lockheed ' s most profitable programs . Lockheed took_over the F-16 project and the Fort_Worth production plant from General Dynamics in March , 1993 , and has since restructured its operations . The revenues from the Fort_Worth plant are estimated by analysts at $ 3 billion per year , nearly 25 % of Lockheed ' s total sales . &quot; The F-16 is a mature program . It no longer requires large investment , so it ' s throwing_off a lot of cash , &quot; said Loren B . Thompson , a defense consultant and policy analyst . Lockheed ' s next-generation jet fighter , the F-22 , which it is developing with the Boeing Co. , won ' t be delivered to the U.S. Air_Force until 2004 , if all goes well . Given that lag , Lockheed is not about to let the F-16 market slip_away . In its aggressive effort to keep the F-16 alive , the firm has laid_off hundreds of workers to save costs , supplied both sides of an arms race between Greece and Turkey , pushed hard for new sales in developing countries like Chile , and agreed to transfer unprecedented levels of technology as part of a sale of planes to South_Korea . The deal allowed South_Korea to manufacture most of the plane itself . Arms-control advocates say such an agenda heightens the risk of high-tech warfare in the developing world . With the Cold_War over , the United States should seize its chance to limit global defense trade , said Lora Lumpe , director of the Washington , D.C.-based Arms Sales Monitoring Project of the Federation of American Scientists . Others argue grimly that if the U.S. doesn ' t sell fighter planes , Russia , Britain or some_other country will . Political realism dictates that export limits focus_on more lethal technology . &quot; It ' s the way it is , &quot; said Kenneth Watman , researcher at the Rand Corp , adding , &quot; That doesn ' t mean I like it. &quot; From Lockheed ' s point_of_view , the company is doing what it takes_to make money in what has become an increasingly competitive international market for Cold_War products . Joe Stout , a Lockheed spokesman , also argues that sales of American fighter planes allow_for U.S. control of contract terms , training and spare_parts . Lockheed believes there ' s a market for 500 to 800 new fighter_aircraft worldwide in the next few years . But overall , the market for military hardware is constricted . U.S. foreign military sales dropped from a record high of $ 33.2 billion last year to $ 12.6 billion in fiscal 1994 , according to the Pentagon . Tooth-and-nail competition for foreign contracts pits Lockheed against other makers of fighter_aircraft . These include Lockheed ' s domestic rival , McDonnell Douglas Corp. , which makes the F / A-18 &quot; Hornet &quot; , a fatter , twin-engine jet used by the U.S. Navy . McDonnell Douglas also makes the F-15 &quot; Eagle &quot; an air-combat fighter that costs about $ 50 million . Last year McDonnell Douglas won a major victory at Lockheed ' s expense when it landed a $ 2-billion deal to build 21 new F-15s for Israel . Lockheed is now vying with McDonnell Douglas again for a potential multibillion-dollar contract from the United Arab Emirates , which wants as_many as 80 fighter planes . Experts say the contest is shaping into another highly competitive duel , with the likely result that the tiny gulf state will someday own planes as_good_as those of the U.S. Air_Force . Nor has Lockheed neglected the domestic market . The company is an enthusiastic backer of a Pentagon proposal dubbed a &quot; high-tech yard sale &quot; by Tom Cardamone , editor of Arms Trade News in Washington , D.C. , and a critic of the plan . The Pentagon idea is to sell as_many as 360 used F-16s abroad next year . Money raised would be spent on new F-16 Lockheed planes for the Air_Force . Potential recipients are countries that would have trouble affording planes otherwise , such_as the Philippines , Tunisia and Morocco . If Congress signs_off on the plan , Lockheed also stands to gain by doing modification work_on the old F-16s before they are parceled_out . Lockheed has also tried to get the Pentagon to buy a_few more F-16s by reducing the price to $ 20 million per plane , down from about $ 23 million from its latest sale . The versatility and low price of the F-16 has made_it a valuable commodity . The jet is used for both bombing raids and dogfights , day or night . F-16s made one-quarter of the air strike sorties by the U.S. military against Iraq in 1991 and were deployed last spring against Bosnian Serbs . Capt . Paul McIntosh , who flies an F-16 nicknamed &quot; Wild Thang &quot; out of Utah ' s Hill Air_Force Base , said the plane ' s avionics and electronics are so advanced that the cockpit resembles a videogame , and is about as easy to use . Flying the plane &quot; is like sitting on the edge of a magic carpet , &quot; McIntosh said . The single-seat F-16 is a 50-foot cylinder of smooth , gleaming metal with a pointy nose . Its fuselage is so slender that you could almost wrap your arms around it . At times , the F-16 has gotten too fancy for its own good : One version of the plane offered a steering stick so sensitive that it responded to the slightest pressure of the palm . Air_Force pilots -- who were used to less-sensitive parts -- were unnerved , and eventually the device was retooled to allow a small amount of gratuitous motion . Lockheed attributes the long life of the plane to continuous upgrades . Newer versions offer state-of-the-art radar technology and ever more powerful engines -- all packed into a design that dates_back to the ' 70s . Once , you could easily slide a fist in the space between the engine ' s nozzle and the wall of the fuselage that contains it . Now , because the engine is so_much bigger , you could barely squeeze a quarter between them . Since Lockheed bought the F-16 program from General Dynamics , it has also introduced what the company calls &quot; lean manufacturing &quot; techniques . About 14 # 000 people work in the Forth Worth plant now , down from 31 # 000 five years ago , and Lockheed will bring that number down to 13 # 000 by the end of this year to reduce the cost of the F-16 . Since it acquired the plant , Lockheed claims revenue earnings per employee have doubled . The changes have not come without pain , however . In some cases , Lockheed workers who lost their jobs end_up being hired back through subcontractors for lower pay , said John C . Crowdis , business representative for the local chapter of the International Assn . of Machinists and Aerospace Workers . The union is also angry about foreign production of F-16s . Workers protested when the company agreed to transfer some technology as part of its deal to allow South_Korea to make the plane . &quot; We have had to make some tough decisions . . . . But the fact is it allows us to make sales that we would n ' t make otherwise , &quot; replied Stout , the Lockheed spokesman . Neither exports nor foreign production of the F-16 are new . Assembly_lines for portions of the fighter were set_up in Belgium and the_Netherlands for members of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization the same year the U.S. Air_Force got is first delivery of the plane in 1978 . Replacements and upgrades for longtime customers are still big business for Lockheed . But over the years , the pool of foreign buyers has extended beyond NATO members to include Egypt , Indonesia , Bahrain and others . Foreign sales of the plane are conducted through the U.S._government . No American contractor can sell military equipment without State_Department approval . As F-16s have proliferated , they have surfaced in some odd places . Venezuela , which bought 24 of the planes in 1982 , has used them to combat gold smugglers . The Turkish government is believed to have used F-16s to attack villages of Kurdish rebels . Like Turkey , neighboring Greece has also sought renewed orders of F-16s from Lockheed . The purchases reflect , in part , &quot; a simmering , low-level arms race &quot; between the two , said William Hartung , senior research fellow at the World Policy Institute in New York . Hartung is critical of the Lockheed sales . Watman , the Rand expert , said it can ' t be avoided . &quot; I know this sounds cold , but would it make people feel better if we only sold them to Greece and the Turks bought ( Russian-made ) MIGs ? &quot; F-16 sales have been a prickly matter between the U.S. and Pakistan . The U.S. interrupted delivery of the planes when a dispute flared over Pakistan ' s nuclear program . Pakistan later stopped_payments , and the Fort_Worth plant eventually canceled 43 planes from its backlog . Another agreement in 1992 to sell 150 F-16s to Taiwan caused a rift between the U.S. and China . Controversy over aircraft sales draws little comment from Lockheed . &quot; These are foreign_policy decisions and the ( U.S. ) government has their reasons for why they make these decisions , &quot; said Stout . Lockheed and other defense_contractors are pressing Congress to be less restrictive of aircraft exports and provide more money to finance purchases for countries short on cash . Although the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War sparked outrage over worldwide sales of military technology , opposition has softened as the debate turned_to preserving jobs , said Lumpe , of the Arms Control Monitoring Project . The defense industry &quot; turned this argument away from instability and death and warfare . . . . They ' ve made_it like selling toaster ovens or anything else , &quot; she said . Jets to Go Lockheed Corp. ' s F-16 jet fighter was first introduced in 1978 . The versatile plane remains a major source of revenue and Lockheed has an $ 11.2-billion backlog for 519 F-16 jet orders and service_contracts . But U.S. Air_Force purchases of F-16s are slated to dry_up this year . However , sales of the F-16 to foreign countries , with approval by the U.S._government , continues to be strong . In foreign markets , the single-engine F-16 competes increasingly against a twin-engine rival , the FA-18 , made by McDonnell Douglas . Here is a look_at the sales of F-16 fighter jets worldwide . Foreign contract figures include both jets on order , and those already delivered . Lockheed F-16 Fighter Jet Sales Overseas : Bahrain : 12 Belgium : 160 Denmark : 70 Egypt : 174 Greece : 80 Indonesia : 12 Israel : 210 Netherlands : 213 Norway : 74 Pakistan : 68 Portugal : 20 Singapore : 26 South_Korea : 160 Taiwan : 150 Thailand : 36 Turkey : 240 Venezuela : 24 Total F-16 sales to foreign countries : 1 # 729 jets F-16 deliveries to U.S. Air_Force : 2 # 151 jets Source : Congressional Research Service , Washington D.C. and Lockheed .</TEXT>
