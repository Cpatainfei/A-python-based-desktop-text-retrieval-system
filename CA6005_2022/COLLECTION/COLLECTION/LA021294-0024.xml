   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE FINISHES FIRST MISSION WITH COSMONAUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The space shuttle Discovery and its crew swooped through high clouds and landed safely Friday , ending the first U.S. spaceflight with a Russian cosmonaut aboard . &quot; You paved the way for a new era of cooperation in human spaceflight , &quot; Mission Control told the five astronauts and one cosmonaut . Sergei Krikalev became the first Russian to fly_on a U.S. shuttle when Discovery left on the science mission Feb . 3 . The crew ' s homecoming Friday was delayed 1 1 / 2 hours , or one orbit , because of thick , low clouds and high winds at the space center . National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials considered sending the shuttle to Edwards Air_Force Base in California , but the sky cleared enough in Florida to allow the midafternoon landing . Despite the unprecedented partnership , the Discovery crew failed to accomplish one of the primary objectives of the mission -- releasing a research satellite . The Wake Shield Facility , a steel disc , was supposed to fly free_of Discovery for two days and develop high-grade semiconductor film in its pure-vacuum wake . It was hoped that the film eventually could lead to faster computers . But transmission troubles and a bad guidance system prevented crew_members from deploying the satellite . Instead , it developed the film while dangling on the end of Discovery ' s robot arm . In other experiments , a small German science satellite was successfully released Wednesday , as were six metal balls ejected from a cargo bay canister so space debris experts could track them from Earth . Discovery also carried a small commercial laboratory called Spacehab . Most of the 12 Spacehab experiments involved biotechnology : splitting cells , for instance , and growing protein crystals . Within minutes of the shuttle ' s touchdown , officials at the Russian control_center for the Mir space_station were_on the phone to Mission Control , congratulating their American counterparts on Discovery ' s return . The eight-day shuttle trip boosted Krikalev ' s time in space to 471 days , almost all_of it aboard Mir . Americans and Russians flew together during the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz docking mission , but never before had a Russian been launched on a U.S. spacecraft or landed in one . Another Russian cosmonaut is_due to fly_on a shuttle early next year , and two Americans head to Russia next week to train for a 1995 stint on Mir . Up to 10 shuttle-Mir dockings are planned beginning in 1995 , with the goal being a joint space_station by 2001 .</TEXT>
