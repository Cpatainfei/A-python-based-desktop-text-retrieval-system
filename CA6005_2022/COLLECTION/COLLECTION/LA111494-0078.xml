   <HEADLINE> WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY : LEADERSHIP ROLE SOUGHT FOR MINORITIES , WOMEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Moving toward his self-imposed mandate to press the U.S. Olympic Committee and the sports under its umbrella to include more minorities and women in leadership positions , USOC President LeRoy Walker appointed separate task_forces Sunday to address both issues . According to a recent USA Today survey , 46 % of athletes in Olympic sports are minorities and 42 % are women , and yet the national governing bodies for those sports have only 10 % minority and 26 % female representation within their board of directors and trustees . As for the USOC , its 101-member board of directors includes 13 minorities and 19 women . &quot; Long before the surveys and the comments from the outside , I knew and felt strongly that we needed to tap into as_many of these individuals as we could , getting them involved , &quot; said Walker , who two years ago became the USOC ' s first African-American president . &quot; I ' ve told these ( task_force members ) I don ' t just want to hear about the problems . I want solutions and ways to implement them. &quot; * In an emotional moment during the USOC ' s board of directors meeting at the Opryland Hotel , the chairman of the Native_American Sports Council , Gene Keluche , was in tears as he accepted membership for his group into the USOC as a community-based , multi-sport organization . &quot; Today is a fulfillment of a prophecy of an ancient foretelling , that one day we would be standing here to be recognized for our own talents and the contributions that we can make to the world , &quot; said the NASC ' s executive_director , John EagleDay . &quot; We cannot be ignored . We cannot be separated . We cannot be denied the opportunity for our young people to soar to the heights of their ambitions . that ' s what the Olympics represents. &quot; * The USOC is operating with a record $ 409 million budget_for the quadrennium that ends with the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta . But , without an Olympics in the United States to drive marketing efforts during the following four years , there are concerns that the next budget might have to be cut by $ 40 million or more . Walker has suggested that the USOC consider sending less than a full_complement of qualified athletes to the Olympics as a money-saving measure . Despite initial resistance from athletes and officials , many say now that they will at least consider it . &quot; It will be a highly charged issue , &quot; USOC treasurer Sandra Baldwin said . * Just as Mick Jagger said he would not still be singing &quot; Satisfaction &quot; when he was 50 , British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean had no thoughts of performing to &quot; Bolero &quot; 10 years after their stunning rendition of it won them gold medals during the 1984 Winter_Olympics at Sarajevo . But Torvill and Dean have included that number in their tour that stops next Sunday night at the Forum . Also performing is former U.S. and world champion Jill Trenary , who married Dean last month . * Edwin Moses is not making a comeback . There have been numerous reports to the contrary since the two-time gold medalist in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles said last summer that he would return to competition if he could train without pain . &quot; There are three key_words -- train without pain -- that everyone seems to be ignoring , &quot; he said . &quot; Who can train without pain ? Of course , I ' m not coming back. &quot; * The first_half of Bud Greenspan ' s documentary about the 1994 Winter_Olympics , &quot; Lillehammer : 16 Days of Glory , &quot; will premier Nov . 27 on the Disney Channel . Even non-subscribers will be able to see the segment , which peaks with the story of speedskater Dan Jansen ' s emotional triumph in the 1 # 000 meters . * The most prominent speedskater of the last decade , Bonnie Blair , announced last winter that she will retire after next year ' s world sprint championships in Milwaukee , but not even her agent believes her . &quot; Knowing Bonnie , she ' s going_to finish the year and say , ' Let ' s go_for another one , ' &quot; Helen Wald said . But Blair insists she has no plans to continue . &quot; I can ' t think_of anything that would change my mind , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' m going_to have the biggest competition of the season in my own back yard and walk away . I ' ve already accomplished more_than I ever thought possible , and now there are other things I want to do with my life. &quot; Notes USOC President LeRoy Walker said he would like to see a new executive_director to replace Harvey Schiller in place before the Pan American Games next March . &quot; But we all know that ' s not possible , &quot; Walker said . The end of 1995 is more realistic , he said . A search committee has been formed . Early candidates are believed to include USOC interim Executive_Director John Krimsky , U.S. Skiing President Mike Jacki , U.S. Figure_Skating Executive_Director Jerry Lace , former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson , Women ' s Sports Foundation President Donna Lopiano , former Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire and Liberty Bowl CEO Steve Erhart . . . . Schiller , now president of Turner Sports , and Pilson are expected to receive the Olympic Order from International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch next year . In lieu of flowers to honor Wilma Rudolph , the late sprinter ' s family has requested that contributions be sent to The Wilma Rudolph Scholarship Fund , P.O. Box 220-82 , Nashville , Tenn. , 37202 . . . . After a search for a site that would provide both offices and a training center , USA Volleyball is expected to keep its officials in Colorado Springs and its athletes in San Diego . . . . Long_Beach is among three finalists as headquarters for the international softball federation . Initial projections were that the Atlanta Olympics would provide a surplus of $ 160 million . Now , the estimate is less than $ 60 million . Costs were higher than anticipated . . . . The International Amateur Athletic Federation , which oversees track_and_field , and medical authorities continue to dispute the starting_time for the men ' s marathon in Atlanta . The IAAF wants it to begin in the late afternoon for the finish to coincide with the start of the closing ceremony . Doctors prefer a morning start , saying the heat and humidity in Atlanta in the late afternoon will endanger the athletes .</TEXT>
