   <HEADLINE> RUSSIANS WARN WEST AGAINST BOSNIA STRIKES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With rare unanimity , Russian lawmakers across the political spectrum united behind President Boris N . Yeltsin on Wednesday in warning that a NATO air strike in Bosnia would seriously damage Western relations with Russia . Ultranationalist leader Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky delivered a near-hysterical speech to Parliament , warning that &quot; a bombing strike on Bosnia is a declaration of war on Russia ; it is the beginning of World_War III. &quot; Even devout liberals , including former First Deputy Prime_Minister Yegor T . Gaidar and other prominent westernizers , warned that military_action against the Serbs would be seen here as U.S.-sponsored aggression . &quot; It would be a disaster for Russian-American relations , &quot; said Vyacheslav Nikonov , who once taught Russian politics at Caltech and now chairs the security and arms control subcommittee in the Duma , or lower house of Parliament . &quot; After you start bombing Yugoslavia , we ' ll never ratify the START II treaty , never , &quot; Nikonov said . &quot; The treaty is in big trouble anyway , but that would destroy its chances. &quot; Yeltsin was_sick with a cold Wednesday and was working from his countryside dacha , but a spokesman said the president was &quot; in continuous contact &quot; with world leaders and had been urging them not to bomb Bosnia-Herzegovina . Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev , in a letter to U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , reiterated Russia ' s opposition to the use of force . Kozyrev said Russia believes that only the secretary_general , in consultation with the U.N. Security_Council , has the right to order bombing , the Interfax news_agency reported . Underlining that position , Gaidar said Russia &quot; must firmly speak against bombardment of Bosnian Serb positions in the U.N. and its Security Council. &quot; The young economist said Russia might veto a Security_Council resolution authorizing bombardment . There was no immediate government reaction Wednesday evening to the NATO ultimatum ordering that all heavy artillery be moved 13 miles outside Sarajevo within seven to 10 days . Earlier in the day , Interfax , quoting unnamed Foreign Ministry sources , reported that Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin will present a Russian plan to demilitarize Sarajevo at talks in Geneva today . The president ' s spokesman described that proposal as &quot; very sensitive &quot; and declined to provide details . Russia has historically supported Bosnia ' s Serbs , who are brother Slavs and Orthodox Christians . Russian Slavophiles have gone_to the former Yugoslav federation to fight on the Serbs ' side . Many Russians believe the Serbs have suffered in the conflict as much as Muslims and Croats , and most reject Western suggestions that the Serbs have largely been the aggressors . These sympathies have been reinforced by the Russian media . Though diplomatic developments receive constant coverage , Russian television over the past year has shown comparatively little daily footage of the Bosnian carnage that has so horrified Western viewers . However , graphic footage of Sunday ' s massacre in the Sarajevo marketplace has been repeatedly aired in recent days . &quot; Our television does not show this very often , &quot; said Irina M . Khakamada , a lawmaker from the December 12th Union , a liberal Duma faction that has not taken a position on Bosnia . &quot; In fact , we are not that well informed. &quot; The faction led by economist Grigory Yavlinsky issued a statement Wednesday warning that North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization involvement &quot; in an armed conflict beyond NATO ' s sphere may break the military-political balance in Europe and contradict Russia ' s national interests. &quot; The statement also warned that lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia would draw Muslim nations into the conflict . Democratic lawmakers especially fear that Russian nationalism and mistrust of the West will be intensified and Yeltsin ' s position weakened if NATO is perceived to be bullying the Serbs . &quot; This will be a great gift to Zhirinovsky , the Agrarians and the Communists , &quot; said Andranik Migranyan , a longtime Yeltsin adviser .</TEXT>
