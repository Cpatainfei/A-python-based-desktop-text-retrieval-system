   <HEADLINE> NO MARKET FOR SELLERS OF PLUTONIUM ; NUCLEAR WEAPONS : REPORTS EXAGGERATING THE TERRORIST RISK ARE NEEDLESSLY ALARMIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Recent arrests by German authorities prove that there are people with access to Russian stocks of plutonium who are willing to sell . The arrests do not prove the existence of a nuclear black_market . A market requires both sellers and buyers . In this case , the only buyers appear to have been German police . Are there others ? The popular literature leaves the impression that there are a vast number of malevolent governments and others whose itch to acquire nuclear_weapons has been frustrated only by the difficulty of acquiring the necessary materiel . With the fall of the Soviet_Union , the impoverishment of its once mighty scientific community , rampant corruption and growing organized crime , this view has changed . We now see sellers -- like those arrested in Germany -- but ask who the buyers might be . On the basis of motive alone , buyers are legion . They range from inmates of mental_hospitals to nations convinced that their survival depends_on nuclear_weapons . The nations mentioned most often include Iran , Iraq , Libya , Syria , Pakistan , Algeria , North and South_Korea , Taiwan and , in the past , Argentina and Brazil . Libya ' s Moammar Kadafi reportedly has offered millions to acquire a nuclear_weapon . Israel is believed to have nuclear_weapons , fabricated in part_with materiel obtained covertly . There are unconfirmed reports that Iran obtained some of the nuclear_warheads that had been stored in Soviet Central Asia . Before the Gulf War dashed Saddam Hussein ' s nuclear ambitions , Iraq may have progressed further in its secret weapons-development program than intelligence_analysts have estimated . Belligerents in current wars might also be included in our nuclear market survey . There are today between 30 and 40 armed conflicts in the world . Driven by historic hatred or religious extremists , ethnic cleansing and other atrocities characterize the fighting . Ethnic foes are easily dehumanized ; I have no doubt that had the bombers of the World Trade Center in New York somehow possessed a nuclear_weapon , they would have detonated it . But even those we label terrorist often operate under self-imposed constraints . They have always had the capacity to kill more people than they do , but generally , they have not done so because they fear it might alienate constituents , cause too_much public revulsion and provoke government crackdowns with popular support . To say that some fanatic might use a nuclear_weapon if he had one handy does not make a market . Beyond fanaticism and hatred , terrorist buyers of nuclear materiel would also require enormous financial resources , organization , international connections , operational autonomy , scientific know-how and total security . The effort to obtain the materiel and fabricate a device would require months , possibly years . Applying these criteria makes_it hard to identify a qualified buyer among today ' s terrorist groups . Organized crime might meet the organizational criteria , but the motives would be primarily economic . And unlike cocaine , there is no ready market for plutonium . It is hard to imagine the Sicilian_Mafia or Japan ' s Yakuza resorting_to nuclear_weapons as a means of extortion or deterrent to the police . Organized crime is more likely to buy nuclear materiel to sell it , which brings us back to the question . Who are the ultimate buyers ? Selling plutonium can be compared to selling a stolen Rembrandt masterpiece -- the goods are hot , the buyers few . We have no evidence that any terrorists ever sought to acquire nuclear_weapons . Although terrorism has become bloodier as terrorists increasingly resort_to more indiscriminate attacks , principally car_bombs , there is no inexorable trend toward weapons of mass destruction .</TEXT>
