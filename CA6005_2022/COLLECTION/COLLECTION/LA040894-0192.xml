   <HEADLINE> FOLLOWING THE LONG , STRANGE TRIP OF ' RED ROCK ' ; MOVIES : THE ' COWBOY NOIR ' FILM , WHICH HAS ROAMED FROM EUROPEAN THEATERS TO FILM FEST TO HBO TO FILM FEST TO VIDEO , FINALLY GETS A U.S. RELEASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If &quot; Red Rock West &quot; once was a tough sell , it ain ' t any more . The celebrated movie , dubbed a &quot; cowboy noir &quot; by its distributors and a wicked black comedy by many critics , was headed to a quick fade-out on the movie-channel horizon until a San Francisco distribution company came_to the rescue . Roxie Releasing has resuscitated the theatrical life of &quot; Red Rock West , &quot; which has gone a strange if not unprecedented course from European movie_houses to film festival to HBO to film festival to video and now selected theaters in major U.S. cities , including Los Angeles ' Laemmle Sunset-5 . And no one is more relieved than director John Dahl , who publicly bemoaned the fate of his $ 7.5-million picture starring Nicolas Cage at the first Hamptons International Film Festival last year , saying U.S. distributors ignored the film ' s good notices and healthy overseas box-office take . The picture , produced by Polygram through its subsidiary Propaganda Films , was a critical and popular hit in East Hampton , and earlier at the Toronto Film Festival , yet struck_out with the usual distributors of art-house films like Miramax , Goldwyn and others . In the film , Cage plays a drifter who is wrongly mistaken for a hit-man while getting tangled up in a web of larceny , deception and murder that also involves the intended victim , played by Lara Flynn Boyle , whom Cage falls_in_love with . The Times ' Kevin Thomas , as with many other reviewers , has favorably compared &quot; Red Rock ' s &quot; tone and style to the Coen Bros. ' &quot; Blood Simple. &quot; When reached at the Los Angeles production offices of his current film , &quot; Meltdown , &quot; Dahl said : &quot; It ' s satisfying that people walk away from a movie and then come_back and see it has a second life. &quot; Roxie Releasing C.E.O. Bill Banning said that in mid-January , when he wanted to book the picture into his Roxie Theater in San Francisco , he couldn ' t believe it didn ' t have a distributor , since &quot; Red Rock West &quot; had been one of his top-five favorites at the Toronto Film Festival in September . * He also learned that Columbia TriStar Home Video , which had put_up $ 3.5 million of the movie ' s production_costs , had already made a deal with HBO to recoup some of its money . ( Dahl , in fact , recalls when making the rounds of the film festival circuit -- the movie also was shown at World Festival Charleston ( S.C. ) and the Virginia Film Festival -- how some people commented to him that they remembered &quot; Red Rock West &quot; from their cable_television listings. ) What might have further put Banning off , at about this same time Columbia was releasing the home-video version on a limited basis . But , as Banning said he discovered , &quot; It almost didn ' t matter , because this movie was an extreme crowd-pleaser , &quot; noting that &quot; Red Rock West &quot; broke the Roxie ' s house record in its fourth week , helped by raves in the local press , and its L.A. and N.Y. grosses aren ' t far behind . With a relatively meager promotional and advertising budget of $ 100 # 000 , Roxie said critics ' notices and good word-of-mouth has to sell the picture . Still , with 20 prints struck and plans to expand to Washington , Boston , Chicago and elsewhere soon , he expects to break_even . &quot; ' Cowboy noir ' isn ' t a big hook , but it ' s a great hook to certain people . You really have to see it to get_it , &quot; he said . Or , as Dahl put it : &quot; It ' s not ' Schindler ' s List , ' but it ' s a good little movie . . . . As far as I ' m concerned , this is just terrific. &quot;</TEXT>
