   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; ILLUSION , REALITY AND HEROES ; SHOULD IT COME AS A SURPRISE THAT ANOTHER AMERICAN ICON -- O.J. SIMPSON -- MAY BE TUMBLING FROM GRACE ? NOT REALLY , SAY STUDENTS OF SOCIETY ' S LOVE-HATE AFFAIR WITH THE FAMOUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Heroes are created by popular demand , sometimes out of the scantiest materials , or none at all . -- Gerald W . Johnson , in his 1943 book , &quot; American Heroes and Hero-Worship &quot; There is a moment , in the lives of some whom society holds_up as idols , when private character collides with a public persona . It is at this juncture that Americans often make a jarring , unwanted discovery : Their gods have feet of clay . John F . Kennedy , we learn after his death , cheated_on his genteel wife . A bloated Elvis Presley , his body brimming with drugs , takes his last breath on a bathroom floor . Jimmy Swaggart cavorts with a hooker . Magic Johnson cuts_short his brilliant basketball career , disclosing that his promiscuity is responsible_for his infection with the virus that causes AIDS . Now there is O.J. -- so likable , so friendly , so familiar that the initials need not be followed by a last_name . He is not charged with any crime , but he has wandered into a maelstrom that already is tarnishing his reputation , possibly beyond recovery . In the minds of his public lurk unspeakable , unthinkable images that do not comport with their perception of a man who has befriended them through their TV and movie screens . News vans and paparazzi now surround Simpson ' s Brentwood home , angling for the perfect shot . Defense_lawyers speak_for a man who once spoke eloquently for himself . Ugly details of spousal abuse are being aired anew . Unnamed police sources whisper about shreds of evidence -- a bloody glove , stains on a driveway -- that may or may_not implicate the man many call the greatest running back of all time in the slaying of his pretty former wife and her handsome waiter friend , 10 years younger . Another hero , it seems , is falling from grace . People are shocked , disappointed . &quot; He seemed like such a civilized guy , &quot; one crushed fan laments as he pores over a newspaper story containing sordid allegations that Simpson had beaten his wife in the past . Should another tumbling icon come as any big surprise ? Not really , according to psychologists , sociologists and observers of popular culture . Scandals such_as the one enveloping O.J. Simpson come_about , these experts say , because of the unique tendency of Americans -- through television , the movies , the print media and advertising -- to embellish heroes by assigning qualities of perfection to those who are not perfect . &quot; The nature of the medium of celebrity is to make ( stars ) seem familiar to us , &quot; said David Harris , a San Francisco writer and author of a book on the National Football_League . &quot; We think we know them . They are people that are in some way included , in the psychological sense , as extended family . that ' s the illusion that keeps being punctured in these things . Stepping back from it , how could we think we knew who he was ? &quot; Yet even Harris said part of him -- the part that is purely a football fan -- was stunned to learn that police are considering Simpson a suspect in the brutal slayings of his former wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Lyle Goldman . The pair were discovered stabbed to death shortly after midnight Sunday , their blood-soaked bodies sprawled on a walkway near the Brentwood condominium where Nicole Simpson lived with the couple ' s two young children . &quot; Oh no . No no noooo , &quot; Harris said , recounting his reaction to the news . &quot; Not O.J. Simpson . This couldn ' t be . I didn ' t want it to be true . Nobody wants it to be true. &quot; * &quot; Famous people are very important in a democratic society , &quot; said Leo Braudy , an English_professor at USC and author of &quot; The Frenzy of Renown : Fame and Its History. &quot; Americans , Braudy said , &quot; have an ongoing preoccupation with the famous as enlarged images of ourselves , ideal versions , versions of traits we ' d like to have . . . or do have in small amounts. &quot; Yet the very reason the public can idealize famous people is that stars enjoy a luxury few others have : the ability to create a public image that is separate from -- and sometimes not consistent with -- one ' s private life . &quot; Fame is the most obvious place where individuals , private people , can create a personality that exists not just for their family or for their inner nature , but for an audience , &quot; Braudy said . &quot; The whole question of who we are when we are alone is something that the issue of fame plays_around with in an intriguing way. &quot; The more people expect of a famous_person , experts say , the more difficult it is for the public to accept that their idols fall_short_of expectations . When a rock ' n ' roll star with an outlaw image gets_in trouble , the public is not particularly surprised -- and experts say the star ' s standing may even be enhanced by his escapades . But when , in the wake of the death of Martin_Luther_King Jr. , reports emerge that the revered civil_rights leader may have been a philanderer , his admirers are devastated . &quot; It ' s like when we heard about the Watergate tapes , &quot; said Century City psychologist Lilli Friedland . &quot; To hear that the President could talk in that kind of gutter language . . . . It took something away from the power of the office , from the awesomeness of it all . It made_it almost too human. &quot; Over time , through Watergate and other political scandals , Americans have come_to expect less of their politicians -- so_much so that although U.S. Sen . Gary Hart was forced_out of a presidential race after being linked with a woman other_than his wife , Bill_Clinton went_on to win the presidency despite allegations of marital infidelity . But the sports world is a place where people still yearn for untainted heroes to remain untainted , said Steven Stark , who comments on popular culture for National Public Radio . So it is especially devastating when sports heroes fall . Recent sports history is_full of scandal , ranging from outfielder Darryl Strawberry ' s drug problems to boxer Mike Tyson ' s conviction for rape to baseball great Pete Rose ' s gambling troubles . &quot; Sports is this place that we like to think is pure , whereas the rest of society has been corrupted , &quot; Stark said . &quot; It ' s a place where clear rules apply . There is always black_and_white , there is a winner and a loser . In a culture where so_much else has gotten confused , where so many other images have gotten blurred , it is very important for people to hold_on to these pristine images of sports . So when these sorts of scandals occur in the sports world , it is terribly upsetting to people. &quot; Also terribly upsetting , psychologists and others say , are scandals in which children are let_down . Consider Pee Wee Herman , who was arrested in a Florida X-rated movie_house , said Michael Kamins , a USC marketing professor . &quot; Pee Wee Herman , &quot; Kamins said , &quot; was for kids . You said : ' Oh my god , how could he do that ? ' &quot; * A similar refrain -- &quot; Could he really do that ? &quot; -- is now being echoed across the nation about Simpson , despite the legal presumption that he is innocent . The shock is especially acute because of the vast gulf between the football star ' s image and the grisly nature of the crime at_hand . Orenthal James Simpson has long been more , much more , than a great football_player . His early story was the stuff of media legends -- a local boy who made_good and overcame a difficult life , born in what was then the predominantly black Potrero Hill section of San Francisco to a hospital worker mother who was separated from his father . &quot; He led an aimless , street-corner existence , &quot; reads one 1969 biography of Simpson , &quot; running with a gang and coming_close to serious trouble with the law on several occasions before his energies found a positive outlet in athletics. &quot; His statistics spoke_for themselves . When his career ended , he had carried the ball more times -- 2 # 404 -- than any previous running_back in pro football history ; he had rushed for more yards -- 11 # 236 -- than anyone except Jim Brown ; he had gained more ground in one season -- 2 # 003 yards in 1973 -- than any other player before him . Any athlete can rack_up numbers . Simpson had style . On the field , he was elegant , graceful ; when he retired in 1979 , the Washington Post sports page wrote_of &quot; moves that Nureyev could envy . . . fakes and sprints and balletic leaps , a powerful choreography that elevated running with a football to an art form. &quot; Off the field , he came_across as charming and easy to like -- dashing across airports in Hertz rental car ads , picking_apart plays as a television commentator in the awkward , yet endearing manner some retired sports stars have , playing hokey characters in Naked Gun movies . He seemed like the kind of guy who would gladly sign an autograph for a stranger , said Harris , the writer from San Francisco . &quot; After his football career , he succeeded in projecting an extraordinarily warm persona , &quot; Harris says . &quot; While this guy made his living selling rental cars and the_like , he did_it without seeming to cheapen himself . &quot; He was a guy without a smudge on him , &quot; Harris said . &quot; If you ask the question : ' Who is likely to go_out and murder his wife ? ' there are plenty of sports figures who might come_to_mind instantly . O.J. Simpson is not one of those . Far from it . He ' s at the other end. &quot; * On Figueroa Street near USC , at a Mexican restaurant and sports bar in the shadow of the stadium where O.J. Simpson made some of his greatest touchdown runs , the Wednesday night scene serves_up a mixture of disbelief , confusion and sadness along with the margaritas and cervezas . &quot; Devastated , &quot; Steve Franks declares himself at the mention of Simpson ' s name . On the big screen , the New York Knicks were duking it out with the Houston Rockets in the NBA finals . But another sport was_on Franks ' mind . The fortyish controller of an attorney ' s messenger service in Downtown Los Angeles grew_up watching Juice cut and fake and sprint , first for the USC Trojans and later for the Buffalo Bills . &quot; If there is such a glove , if there were bloodstains . . . . To take a knife ? . . . &quot; his voice trails off . &quot; It ' s like a dagger in my heart. &quot; Franks ' table mate , 24-year-old Ladell Wilkins , doesn ' t really want to talk_about the Simpson affair . Wilkins played some high_school football -- running back , the same position Simpson played . &quot; I ' m a little confused , &quot; Wilkins said plainly . &quot; He was my idol. &quot; Yet twinned with this sense of disbelief is a grim curiosity , a thirst for more information . Even as the media come under_attack for sensationalizing the murders and laying_out a case against Simpson before he has been charged with any crime , people such_as Franks say they are lapping_up whatever information they can get . &quot; I ' m getting hooked , &quot; Franks said . &quot; Today I caught myself reading three papers to find_out about the story. &quot; * Some believe the reason people have heroes , especially sports heroes , is to make them feel better about themselves . Dr. Stanley Teitelbaum , a New York City psychologist who has written_about the role of sports in American society , says people &quot; connect how they feel about themselves and their own lives with how the hero is doing. &quot; Teitelbaum added : &quot; If you latch yourself onto a winning team , and they win , you feel_like a winner. &quot; But when the winning team loses , or the hero topples off his pedestal , he said , &quot; it may feel_like a personal blow -- like if you ' re bringing_down ( my idol ) , you ' re bringing_down a part of me. &quot; When an idol takes a tumble , psychologists and other experts say , there are a series of predictable reactions . Some people become even more loyal supporters , refusing to believe bad news . Some people blame the messenger -- often the press . Some become disillusioned , angry , even disgusted . And some watch with fascination , transfixed by the public unraveling of an icon . &quot; People want to have heroes , &quot; said Stark , the NPR commentator , &quot; but on the other hand there is this sort of interest in the perverse qualities of them at_the_same_time . It ' s sort of an American tradition to tear people down. &quot; Whether Simpson will be torn_down in the end depends , in large part , on how the slaying of his former wife is resolved . Some say that even if he is never charged , Simpson will always be tainted , if only by the revelation that he pleaded no contest to a charge of spousal battery in 1989 . Others , such_as Dallas Willard , a USC philosophy professor who lectures on the role of sports in society , say that even if Simpson is implicated , he will always be afforded more sympathy than scorn . &quot; He spent too many years , &quot; Willard said , &quot; wearing those grooves of goodness in the mind of the public. &quot; Times staff writer Ralph Frammolino contributed to this report .</TEXT>
