   <TEXT> * Films : Could they be thinking_of &quot; Bill and Ted ' s Excellent Adventure ? &quot; China , whose 1.1 billion people are the world ' s biggest potential group of movie viewers , plans to further open its film market by importing 10 &quot; excellent &quot; foreign films annually , the official news_agency Xinhua reported . There was no word as_to what constitutes an &quot; excellent &quot; film , though the news_agency said that &quot; experts here believe that they will include some leading movies -- for example , the Oscar winners. &quot; China began importing films in the 1950s and ' 60s , but audiences there usually end_up having to watch domestic or low-budget action films such_as kung_fu pictures . Under the new policy , producers will share profits with Chinafilm , a foreign film trading company , as well as local film businesses . China is estimated to have about 200 # 000 indoor and outdoor movie_theaters .</TEXT>
