   <TEXT> President Carlos Salinas de Gortari called_for calm and unity in his country Thursday as shocked , angry Mexicans mourned Luis Donaldo Colosio , the ruling party ' s assassinated presidential candidate . Thousands of grieving people filed past Colosio ' s body , which lay_in state at the headquarters here of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI as it is known . After a private , afternoon service at a fashionable funeral_home in the south of the city , Colosio ' s remains were to be cremated today in keeping with the Mexican custom of quick burials , as bodies are generally not embalmed . Salinas declared a national day of mourning , closing banks and the stock_market , although schools remained opened . &quot; The loss of Luis Donaldo Colosio is the deepest call_for Mexicans to remain united , to revive our consciousness as a_people of great moral strength , &quot; the president said in a televised address to the nation . &quot; I call_on all my countrymen to share their indignation with serenity and calm. &quot; But Wednesday ' s assassination appeared to be tearing at the already loose seams that unite Mexico and the ruling party . Colosio supporters openly accused his rival and possible successor , Manuel Camacho Solis , of having a role in the candidate ' s death . In other key developments Thursday : * Political uncertainty prevailed as Mexicans , for the first time in more_than six decades , confronted the prospect of selecting a replacement presidential candidate for the historically stable ruling party . The decision may_not be made until after the Easter holidays , although factions already began disputing the worthiness of various individuals . * In Washington , President Clinton expressed his condolences , condemned the assassination and urged Mexicans to forge ahead in their efforts to improve their economy . The Administration also offered Mexico limited law_enforcement and economic help , while seeking to dispel doubts about the country ' s stability . * In Tijuana , at a crowded news_conference , Atty . Gen . Diego Valades said Mario Aburto Martinez , 23 , an industrial mechanic , had confessed to killing Colosio on Wednesday after a campaign rally in the border city . He said nothing about a possible motive and refused to answer questions . Tests on the gun and Aburto ' s hands show that he alone fired the gun , Valades said . The investigation , including an autopsy , shows that Aburto fired two shots from a Brazilian-made Taurus . 38-caliber revolver , fatally wounding Colosio in the head and abdomen . Valades said the case is not closed , adding that Salinas ordered him to find the full truth . * International investors appeared to react calmly to the assassination and the possibility of a Camacho Solis candidacy . Grief , Suspicion On the day after Colosio ' s assassination , questions flew about Mexico ' s presidential campaign security measures , which traditionally are more lax than in the United States . After Colosio had finished his campaign speech and walked_about 30 feet into the crowd toward his vehicle , Aburto emerged from the crowd on the candidate ' s right side and shot him at point-blank range_in the temple , Valades said . Colosio was shot a second time in the stomach as he crumpled to the ground , but the first shot was the fatal one . Colosio ' s murder was the third significant blow this year for Mexico , a country that prides itself on political stability . His death follows a Jan . 1 peasant uprising in southern Mexico and the kidnaping earlier this month of a prominent banker . Neither matter has been resolved . Mexicans were devastated by their country ' s first major political assassination since 1928 , when Alvaro Obregon , the anti-clerical president-elect , was killed by a religious fanatic . At party headquarters Thursday , mourners like Guadalupe Guerrero , a 34-year-old widow in a faded green T-shirt , sobbed with grief . Her face swollen and anguished , Guerrero said , &quot; I think_of the loss of my own husband and I share this great pain with Mrs . Colosio. &quot; Throughout the capital , people were subdued , shocked at the candidate ' s death . &quot; We are sad , because this is not the way we do things , &quot; said Miguel Palestina , a 33-year-old computer_programmer . &quot; Elections were coming_up . This should have been done with votes , not arms . Many people are discontented , tired_of candidates who make promises and do not keep them . I worry that this will come_down to armed revolt. &quot; The crowds at PRI headquarters mixed their grief with fury . Clenching her fist , Avelina Laguna , a 52-year-old secretary from the city ' s northern suburbs , angrily cried , &quot; Unjust , inhumane men . They should throw the book at them . . . . We must demand justice. &quot; Other angry Colosio supporters questioned security measures in Tijuana , the largest city in Baja California , one of only three states with an opposition party governor . Gov . Ernesto Ruffo Appel defended local and state police , noting that security for the candidate is the responsibility of Mexico ' s equivalent of the Secret_Service . Tijuana provided the eight police_cars the campaign requested , and state judicial police were_on call , he said . &quot; The campaign was given all_the security it asked for. &quot; Political Uncertainty Coming five months before the Aug . 21 federal elections , the assassination of Colosio -- the 44-year-old former social development minister -- raised questions about the presidential succession in a country where , for 65 years , power has passed peacefully among members of a single political_party -- the PRI . &quot; The bullet against Colosio was a bullet against the system , &quot; said economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O . &quot; It was against the notion that Salinas wanted to prolong a personal style of government that has been very effective but very biased against small people. &quot; The assassination , he said , increases the pressure for democratic reforms , even at the price of opening the political_system to_the_point that an opposition candidate might win the presidency . Candidates of eight other parties indefinitely suspended their presidential campaigns and joined the orderly crowds at the PRI headquarters compound , its high-rise buildings draped with Colosio banners . Salinas said party officials had agreed &quot; to act responsibly &quot; without specifying what that means . Colosio ' s PRI successor probably will not be chosen until after the traditional Easter week holidays , a well-informed source said . Popular former Mexico_City Mayor Camacho Solis appeared to be the candidate most likely to succeed Colosio , although the name of campaign manager and former Education Minister Ernesto Zedillo was also mentioned . Many observers were surprised in November when Salinas , exercising the traditional prerogative of the outgoing president , chose his protege Colosio over his longtime friend Camacho Solis , 48 . Colosio was considered a compromise candidate between Camacho Solis , an advocate of political and social reform , and Treasury Minister Pedro Aspe Armella , an inflation-fighter committed to free-market economic_policies . Since then , Camacho Solis ' status has risen as he negotiated with southern rebels . However , a peace agreement has not yet been reached . Earlier this week , in rejecting the possibility of a maverick presidential bid challenging Colosio , Camacho Solis said that peace was more important to him than the presidency . In addition , the peace envoy ' s ongoing rivalry with Colosio has also tainted him , provoking criticisms that he lacked party discipline . He also has powerful enemies inside the PRI , many of whom blame him for Colosio ' s death . &quot; Kill him , kill him , &quot; the crowd shouted , as Camacho Solis arrived_at Colosio ' s funeral . Earlier in the day , mourners gathered at PRI headquarters chanted , &quot; Colosio , si ; Camacho , no. &quot; Market Reaction International investors reacted calmly to Colosio ' s assassination and the possibility of a Camacho Solis candidacy . Mexican stocks dropped about 5 % on light volume in international markets . &quot; The international community views Camacho favorably , &quot; said Kristie King Etchberger , an analyst at D . A . Campbell Co. , a Los Angeles brokerage with a large Mexican stock portfolio . &quot; There was more concern about a split in the party. &quot; That split may be inevitable , said economist Ramirez : &quot; The PRI has been fatally wounded . It has lost all prestige , what little it had. &quot; Still , investors felt reassured that the peso would remain stable . Also Thursday , Mexico received good news when Salinas announced that the nation had joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . Darling reported from Mexico_City and Rotella from Tijuana . Susan Drommet of The Times ' Mexico_City Bureau also contributed to this report .</TEXT>
