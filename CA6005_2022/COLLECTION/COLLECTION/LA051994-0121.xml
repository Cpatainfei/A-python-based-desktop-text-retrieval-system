   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS ; SMOKERS CAN INDULGE ON RESTAURANT PATIOS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seeking a compromise to keep both tobacco fans and no-smoking activists from fuming , Thousand Oaks City_Council members have agreed to let diners light_up on restaurant patios , as long as their seats are 20 feet from the doorway . The decision effectively bans smoking from small , sidewalk cafes with just a_few outdoor tables clustered around the entrance.But restaurant owners with larger patios can create special smoking sections far from the door . Anti-smoking activists had urged the council to consider a complete ban on smoking in outdoor restaurant areas . They argued that children might be tempted to try cigarettes after watching adults relax with cigarettes and coffee in open-air cafes . But Councilman Alex Fiore , a former smoker who quit seven years ago , said a blanket prohibition would be &quot; going just a step too far. &quot; The law barring smoking within 20 feet of any public doorway creates enough hardship , he added . &quot; In my bridge club , if someone wants to smoke they have to go_out the door and walk 20 feet down , &quot; Fiore said . &quot; But then they ' re within 20 feet of the next establishment . So they walk another 20 feet , and they ' re within 20 feet of the next establishment . &quot; It ' s pretty cruel -- we kick them out of the building and then they have to go_into the middle of the parking_lot or the middle of the street to have a cigarette , &quot; Fiore said . &quot; I wish they didn ' t ( smoke ) , but they do , and they shouldn ' t be treated as third-class citizens. &quot; Several council_members hinted that they might reconsider a ban on all outdoor restaurant smoking at a future meeting . They also indicated a willingness to discuss regulating smoking in the workplace . But on Tuesday , all five council_members voted for the compromise position . STEPHANIE SIMON</TEXT>
