   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; NEW RESPECT FOR CEDRAS CONCERNS LEADERS IN CONGRESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than a week ago , President Clinton described Haitian military_leader Raoul Cedras as the head of a band of &quot; armed thugs &quot; responsible_for murder , rape and other atrocities . Now , the U.S._government is treating Cedras with the deference due an allied commander . The sudden rehabilitation of Cedras , as a direct consequence of the deal that headed_off a planned American invasion of Haiti , raises serious questions about the ultimate direction of U.S. policy toward the impoverished Caribbean nation and undercuts Clinton ' s own impassioned rhetoric . Lawmakers from both parties voiced concern Tuesday over the developments . In a speech to the nation Thursday , Clinton detailed gruesome atrocities by the Haitian armed forces . &quot; Let me be clear , &quot; the President said , &quot; ( Lt. ) Gen . Cedras and his accomplices alone are responsible_for this suffering and terrible human tragedy. &quot; But when former President Jimmy_Carter led a team of negotiators in brokering an agreement in which Cedras agreed to resign his post by Oct . 15 and permit 15 # 000 U.S. troops to land in Haiti without a fight , the U.S. attitude changed completely . Opening a White_House news_conference Monday , Clinton dropped all references_to atrocities and even stopped referring to Cedras as a dictator . Rep . Dave McCurdy ( D-Okla. ) said the reversal in the Clinton_Administration ' s attitude &quot; demonstrates the weakness &quot; of Clinton ' s claim that an invasion of Haiti was justified by national security_interests . But he added , &quot; This is not the first time we ' ve seen the demonizing of an opponent or a dictator only to end_up having to deal with him. &quot; Sen . Richard G . Lugar ( R-Ind. ) observed : &quot; The President has immensely complicated the situation by the way he ' s proceeding here . Going_on nationwide television and condemning Cedras as a thug and then saying that our generals are working with him and his police in a cooperative way . . . is confusing , to say the least. &quot; Sen . Christopher J . Dodd ( D-Conn. ) , who supported Clinton ' s original plan to invade Haiti , also expressed doubts about the outcome of Carter ' s diplomacy . &quot; I want Cedras and company to get_out , and do_it soon , &quot; Dodd said . &quot; If this crowd stays around , it ' s going_to be very difficult to restore a civilian government &quot; Sen . Tom Harkin ( D-Iowa ) , who called_upon Clinton to speed_up Aristide ' s return so &quot; we can begin dealing with the duly elected government of Haiti , &quot; added , &quot; We shouldn ' t be dealing exclusively with Cedras and the military , as it now appears we are. &quot; U.S. military_leaders have begun meeting regularly with Cedras to discuss the maintenance of law and order -- by the same police and military that Clinton had accused of a &quot; terrifying pattern &quot; of abuse . Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , conceded that the suddenly respectful treatment of Cedras was a potential source of embarrassment for the U.S._government if Cedras later reneges_on his agreement to step_down . But Shalikashvili said it was better to run that risk than to use military_force to dislodge the Haitian dictator . &quot; For him to have been gone today , we most probably would have taken casualties , they certainly would have taken casualties , &quot; Shalikashvili said Tuesday . &quot; And if we do_it right and if we try not to create friction but , rather , try to maintain that cooperative spirit , I think that ' s one of our better guarantees to keep casualties low. &quot; But other U.S. officials say the deal with Cedras upsets all_of the Administration ' s plans for restoring democracy to Haiti . One official said the Administration had intended to &quot; cleanse &quot; the Haitian military by cutting its 7 # 000-member strength in half and cashiering soldiers guilty of human_rights abuses . But the Carter-Cedras deal makes that difficult . &quot; If we had gone_in with force , we would have been in a position to dictate matters , &quot; the official said . &quot; Now you have Jimmy_Carter in the equation , and he has agreed to certain things. &quot;</TEXT>
