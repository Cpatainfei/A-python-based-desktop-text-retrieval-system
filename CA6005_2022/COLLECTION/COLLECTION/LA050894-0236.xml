   <TEXT> In the fullness of time , historians may point to Jan . 26 as the day the waning fortunes of Charles , Prince of Wales , began to improve -- and with them the outlook for the_British monarchy . Until then , the monarchy and Charles ' claim upon it were undergoing a severe crisis : The prince was deeply unpopular ; he was separated from one of the world ' s most idealized women , Princess Diana ; he was widely reported to be having an affair with a married_woman , and speculation was rife that he might eventually step_down as heir to the throne in favor of his elder son , William . A long-planned royal tour to Australia was supposed to pump up interest in the beleaguered scion , but it got_off to an underwhelming start , with small crowds and little interest . As one radio broadcaster described it , &quot; Indifference is rising to a fever pitch. &quot; Prime_Minister Paul Keating made_it clear that he wished to take Australia out of the Commonwealth , headed by Queen Elizabeth_II . And Keating ' s wife , Annita , declined to curtsy to the royal prince . Then it happened . As Charles prepared to speak in Sydney ' s Tumbalong Park , a 23-year-old Australian-born Asian named David Kang , in a fuddled attempt to protest Australia ' s immigration policies , stumbled onto the stage and fired two blanks from a starter pistol . He was quickly subdued as Charles , impeccably tailored in a dark , double-breasted Savile Row suit , fingered his cuff links and kept calm . &quot; His Royal Coolness , &quot; headlined the Daily Mail , in a typical newspaper reaction . The tour , said the Times of London , was &quot; an unqualified public relations success . His image , which a year ago was looking tarnished , has been noticeably polished. &quot; In retrospect , some skeptics suggested that Charles remained onstage simply because he didn ' t realize what was going_on : He always fiddles_with his cuff links . At public events , the prince often projects an uptight image , complete with many nervous mannerisms -- fingering his signet_ring , adjusting his tie -- all_of which suggests a certain royal insecurity in the outside world . This despite the fact that at 45 , Charles Philip Arthur George , Duke of Cornwall , Duke of Rothesay , Earl of Carrick and Baron of Renfrew , is one of the richest_men in the world . He has the staffs of several palaces ready to do his bidding , the queen ' s aircraft poised to whisk him off to ski in the Alps , and the royal yacht Britannia available for vacations in warmer climes . Yet amid all_the privilege , his perpetually pained expression suggests that life has been unkind -- and perhaps it has . Charles might well complain that it ' s not easy being the heir_apparent , spending your life being groomed for a job that has become , as one observer cruelly put it , waiting for your mother to die . Whatever the exact job description , Charles has , if the opinion polls are any guide , botched it . Until his Australian tour , he had been running at an all-time low for any member of the royal_family , a feat that begs the question : Does the monarchy have any future after Queen Elizabeth_II , now 68 , leaves the scene ? After a vain attempt to ignore the situation , the palace has sought help : genuine spin-doctors and public-relations professionals hired by Charles ' private secretary , former navy commander Richard Aylard , who have launched a full-out campaign to remake Charles ' image into a more caring , warmhearted king-in-waiting . For any group of aides , advising a Prince of Wales heading toward the 21st Century would be difficult . There are no real guidelines and certainly no shining role_models . The previous two princes of Wales were generally considered failures . Edward_VII was a wastrel who made his way through a string of mistresses before he ascended the throne in 1901 at age 60 , when his mother , Queen Victoria , finally died . Though a charming man-about-town , Edward_VIII was a pro-Nazi weakling who gave_up the throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson in 1936 . And Charles ' new staff has one more obstacle to contend with -- the prince himself . Charles patently and publicly refuses to acknowledge that his image needs refurbishing -- or that it even matters . In an April interview in the Sunday Mail , Roy Hattersley , member_of_Parliament and former deputy Labor_Party leader , asked Charles if it is important to be liked . &quot; No , I don ' t go_out of my way to court popularity , &quot; replied the prince . &quot; The idea that I am searching to redefine my job is rot , &quot; Charles told the Financial Times late last year . &quot; It is just that , since the day I got_married , people have chosen to ignore the things I continue to do , day in and day out. &quot; Whatever Charles ' views of himself , almost everyone else agrees that his image needs plenty of buffing . It reached a nadir 16 months ago when , in rapid succession , Buckingham Palace first announced that he and Diana , by far the most popular member of the royal_family , were officially split . Popular opinion quickly took the side of Diana , now 32 . Then came Camillagate , when , in January , 1993 , the tabloid press published a transcript of a taped telephone_call between the prince and Camilla Parker-Bowles , an old friend and wife of Brig . Gen . Andrew Parker-Bowles of the Household Cavalry , an elite army_unit . It was an intensely private lovers ' conversation , embarrassing to read . But read it the public did -- all 1 # 574 words , including the prince ' s awkward wish to become a Tampax in_order to remain close to her . One commentator called it the most widely read royal document since the Magna Carta . Charles ' exchange with Camilla caused howls in pubs and posh drawing_rooms around England and , for that matter , the world . The Italian press immediately dubbed Charles &quot; Principe Tamponcino , &quot; Little Prince Tampon . In his book &quot; Behind Palace Doors : Marriage and Divorce in the House_of_Windsor , &quot; Nigel Dempster , Britain ' s leading gossip_columnist , reported the private reaction of a close friend of Charles : &quot; It was a terrible moment , the worst moment of his life . He wanted to be taken seriously . He sincerely believed he had important things to say . And in six minutes of private conversation , a conversation that was nobody ' s business but his and the woman to whom he was speaking , his reputation was ruined . . . . He really didn ' t deserve to be destroyed so publicly and so cruelly. &quot; So Charles faced in 1993 the fury of his parents , the scorn of his wife and the laughter of his future subjects -- a humiliated object of derision ; in short , a royal wimp . The scandal also inspired widespread examination of once-unquestioned tradition . Britain ' s largest-selling daily , the Sun , editorialized : &quot; People are asking if we really need a royal_family at all . And why we bow and scrape to them , treating them as demigods when many of them behave no better than the rest of us and in some cases a whole_lot worse. &quot; And former Conservative member_of_Parliament and social commentator Matthew Parris declared , &quot; Royalty in Britain is the single most potent symbol of class , and all_the unfairness and all_the waste of human potential that goes_with it. &quot; Even the queen could not ignore such widespread criticism . Although she maintains a steadfast public stoicism , sources close to the palace say that she has issued private warnings to all_of the royals to clean_up their act . Further , these sources say , if there were ever any hints that she might step_down to give her son a decent reign as king , such thoughts are no longer considered . So now , instead of the traditional courtier staff , Charles has a group of professionals who operate out of St . James ' Palace , a dark brick , crenelated castle between London ' s Pall Mall and St . James Park . The central figure on Charles ' staff is Aylard , 42 . Bright , personable , knowledgeable and , most important , worldly , he is a departure from the usual inbred courtiers . &quot; He is the architect of the new policy -- a good man , enthusiastic , a believer in the potential of the Prince of Wales , &quot; says Richard Kay , royal watcher for the Daily Mail . &quot; The downside is that he fails to see the negatives of Charles. &quot; Under Aylard are a deputy private secretary , Stephen Lamport , 43 , a former political novelist who looks_after the majority of foreign tours , and two assistant private secretaries : Matthew Butler , 34 , who handles the prince ' s business and industrial interests and formerly was corporate affairs manager for Vickers Defense_Systems , and Belinda Harley , a highly regarded former literary_agent and professional in public relations who oversees the background reports for the prince , with a hand in speech writing . Crucial to the new staffing is Allan Percival , 42 , the press secretary , a career civil_servant who has an engaging way with the media . He is assisted by Sandy Henney , 42 , a former press officer for Scotland_Yard , who helps schedule Charles ' appearances to make him , as royal reporter James Whitaker puts it , &quot; user friendly. &quot; Still , PR assistance to Charles , says Whitaker , has to be subtle . &quot; The prince needs to be gently persuaded ; some might say conned. &quot; Often , Aylard or Percival will call a strategy meeting with the prince ' s other advisers , including his personal friends of many years ' standing , who range from pleasant , comfortable people like Lord and Lady Tryon to the more sophisticated Nicholas Soames , Conservative_Party parliamentarian and grandson of Winston Churchill . Then there are confidants like explorer Sir Laurens van der Post and environmentalist Jonathon Porrit , to whom he turns for more philosophical insights . All want to improve the prince ' s popularity and with it the image of the monarchy , and they want to do_it at once . Because , as Anthony Holden , a Charles biographer and author of &quot; The Tarnished Crown , &quot; has said , &quot; This is his make-or-break year to win the hearts and minds of the_British people. &quot; IN AN INTERVIEW WITH AUSTRALIAN TV , CHARLES ATTRIBUTED HIS COOLNESS in Sydney to a &quot; thousand years of breeding. &quot; But throughout the kingdom , many commentators have wondered about the end result of that millennium of breeding . For Charles is an unprepossessing specimen : medium height with sloping shoulders , jug ears , narrow , squinting eyes and a forehead usually set_in a frown . He speaks in an adenoidal accent that sounds faintly forced and affected even to upper-class Brits . And while he can trace his lineage back to Anglo-Saxon kings , more recently his family has had an infusion of German blood : King George_V in World_War I arbitrarily changed the family dynastic name from the German Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor , after the town where they spent weekends . The son of a distant , chilly father , Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , Charles was raised in emotionless surroundings , his parents often absent or unavailable . However , he was the first royal to eschew education by palace tutors and attend private secondary_schools and Cambridge_University . He served in the armed forces , his longest hitch with the Royal Navy . But as Prince of Wales and heir to the throne , Charles could never be one of the boys . And he wasn ' t . Even at the height of his popularity , Charles seemed aloof , distracted and distant from his subjects . During the 1980s , Charles , in an effort to compete with his wildly popular wife , became interested in a series of worthy causes : the environment , architecture , organic farming , inner-cities improvement , and jobs and business opportunities for young people . It didn ' t help . His personal staff , unversed in professional media relations , failed to unify Charles ' activities or coverage of them , and the whole effort seemed to drift . Supporters had difficulty discerning how the various enthusiasms tied together . Charles had an arrogant and stubborn side that was not helped by fawning palace courtiers . &quot; They ' ve all led sheltered lives , &quot; comments a former colleague . &quot; There are a real bunch of amateurs and incompetents in Buck House. &quot; Charles ' aides were baffled by their lack of success . The initial revolutionary idea of humanizing the monarchy -- in &quot; Royal_Family , &quot; a 1969 BBC-TV documentary on the queen at_work -- had been an enormous success . But while it allowed the populace to feel closer to Elizabeth_II , it also opened the monarchy ' s closed doors forever . No longer could it be secret , mysterious , private . The public appetite for news of whatever kind about the monarchy and the royal_family became insatiable , and the tabloid press has done its best to satisfy that craving . Newspapers and television networks maintain court correspondents , who attend daily briefings on the activities of the royals and accompany them on trips -- all scrambling for the catchy or lurid headline bits that sell papers . But in spite of the closer press scrutiny -- or more likely because of it -- Charles has failed to capture public affection . His enthusiasms draw criticism or provoke satire . In a long interview with ITV television in 1987 at his country estate , Highgrove , in Gloucestershire , Charles told interviewer Alastair Burnet that he sometimes talked to plants , &quot; and they do respond in a funny way. &quot; It was meant half in jest to show he was a caring gardener . But it promptly earned him the name &quot; the loony prince &quot; by some anti-royal British tabloid papers . Charles ' enthusiasm for the environment again seemed a bit over the top when he wrote_of 1 # 112-acre Highgrove , &quot; As far as I was concerned , every tree , every hedgerow , every wet place , every mountain and river had a special , almost sacred , character of its own. &quot; Rather than a serious heir_apparent , he came_to be portrayed as an eccentric . Nothing he did seemed to go right . He was criticized when he espoused alternative_medicine , to which the_British Medical Assn . strongly objected . British architects complained about his distaste for contemporary design . When Charles visited Scottish crofters ' huts in the Hebrides and traveled_to the Kalahari_Desert in Botswana , critics pointed_out the inconsistencies of a royal prince arriving by air with a TV team in tow and encouraging locals to live the simple life . At the same time , his concerns seemed to veer dangerously into the political field -- which is off-limits to the royals . Former Prime_Minister Margaret Thatcher , for instance , was not happy with the prince ' s statements on the plight of the inner_cities because it smacked of support for the Labor_Party ' s criticism of the Conservatives ' inaction in this area . And in Paris , in December , 1992 , the prince tactlessly defended French farmers -- contrary to the official British position in the GATT trade talks . He was also said to be spreading himself too thin : In November , 1986 , he supported Inner_City Aid with a great_deal of fanfare but then turned his attention to other programs while the original project withered , raising only about $ 50 # 000 of its $ 15-million target . It was shut_down two years later . &quot; In the public imagination , &quot; says Ross Benson , author of &quot; Charles : The Untold Story , &quot; &quot; he came_to be regarded_as arrogant and out of touch , a remote figure who speaks_to his plants and treats his lonely , lovely wife with icy contempt. &quot; Harold Brooks-Baker , publishing director of Burke ' s Peerage , adds : &quot; As his admirer , I think his heart is in the right place . But I think he must avoid being represented as a boring crusader. &quot; In his younger years , Charles was billed as an &quot; action man , &quot; because of his intense devotion to activities such_as parachute jumping and flying a helicopter . But polo , off-trail skiing and fox-hunting were not your average Briton ' s pastimes . And as he grew older , he seemed to become accident-prone , breaking an arm at polo and nearly being killed in an Alpine avalanche . What by all accounts has truly bugged Charles , however , was being upstaged by his glamorous wife . Unlike the late President John F . Kennedy , Charles did not delight in showing_off his captivating spouse . In fact , he actively resented her popularity -- crowds often ignored him as they sought to get close to her . The prince was not amused . For her part , Diana was not above upstaging her royal husband . She knew all_the right photo angles and the tricks to get herself into the papers . Used to being the center_of_attention all his life , Charles resented her fame . And just as he was often chilly and ill-at-ease in pressing the flesh , she was outgoing and warm . A picture of Charles cutting a ribbon at a factory would be accompanied by a picture of Diana cradling a sick child . A speech by Charles on inner-city business opportunities was pushed_aside by Diana ' s comments on AIDS . As author Anthony Holden says , &quot; He keeps banging on about the environment while she visits hospitals and talks to lepers. &quot; When it became clear that the marriage was in_trouble , and that Diana was stealing Charles ' thunder , the palace courtiers stonewalled , insisting that the monarchy represented the best of everything . Meanwhile , Charles began heeding the instruction his father reportedly gave him shortly after the wedding : Give the marriage five years , then if it was not working_out , look elsewhere . Charles did so . As one familiar_with the royal_family explained , &quot; All the princes of Wales played_around . So , he thought , why shouldn ' t he ? &quot; The defining image of the Wales ' marriage was a photograph taken during their joint trip to India in February , 1992 : the princess , sitting alone on a bench gazing wistfully at that splendid Mogul temple to love , the Taj Mahal . Charles had remained in Delhi to speak_to a group of industrialists . Inevitably , Charles turned_to former flame Camilla Parker-Bowles , and she became an unofficial hostess at his country estate while Diana remained in London at their apartment in Kensington Palace . Friends and courtiers chose sides . Diana was furious that the queen continued to entertain the Parker-Bowleses in her box at Ascot and Windsor for horsy events . And palace sources , loyal to the family , began painting Diana as a spoiled , temperamental prima_donna with no sense_of_responsibility -- given to frequent rages when she didn ' t get her way . Charles , friends told Ross Benson , realized he had made his &quot; worst mistake &quot; in marrying Diana . At one point he reportedly told his mother : &quot; Don ' t you realize , she ' s mad . She ' s mad. &quot; Diana ' s friends encouraged author Andrew Morton to tell the princess ' side of the case , which he did_in his best-selling book , &quot; Diana : Her True Story. &quot; It describes her frustrations and her illness with bulimia and claims she made halfhearted suicide attempts . The book tore it with the family . The senior royals and their courtiers viewed what they considered Diana ' s collaboration as rank disloyalty . They realized they were dealing with a princess who had no intention of knuckling_under to their orders and instructions . Things were heading toward crisis . At the same time , the Diana-versus-Charles theme was rivaled by the collapse of the marriage of his brother , Andrew , the Duke of York , and the duchess , Sarah Ferguson , better known as Fergie . As a bachelor naval_officer , &quot; Randy Andy &quot; had enjoyed rough sailor humor and nights on the town . But as a husband , he turned_to golf and TV and couch-potato takeaway suppers . His wife , in turn , spent much time on vacations during his absences , most of them underwritten by American millionaires . She finally compromised herself with a_couple_of Texas jet-setters , Steve Wyatt and John Bryan , which led to a royal separation in the summer of 1992 . The breakdown of the Yorks ' marriage -- precipitated by pictures of topless Fergie , her toes being sucked by John Bryan poolside in St . Tropez -- dispelled the notion that the Windsors were one big happy royal_family . As London Times writer Valerie Groves observed of the Windsors ' marital track record : &quot; Great weddings ; shame about the marriages. &quot; The queen , too , received a rude , royal awakening -- as usual , she was unprepared by her own dim courtiers -- when she found_out her overtaxed subjects objected to one of the richest_persons in the world not paying income_tax . Then , when Windsor Castle was badly damaged by fire in November , 1992 , a government_minister quickly agreed to earmark $ 90 million in public funds to repair the structure . The offer was met by a hail of protest on the grounds the queen could afford to pay_for renovations herself . Another columnist needled : &quot; While the castle stands , it is theirs , but when it burns_down , it is ours. &quot; Last year , the queen gave_in and began paying income_tax , at the same rate as her subjects . And she is paying_for almost all_of Windsor ' s repair , since the public_trust fund raised only a fraction of the renovation costs . But the year held yet another scandal : the tapes of a telephone_call between Diana and a young male friend , generally identified as James Gilbey , a well-connected used-car salesman , who referred to her by a pet name , &quot; Squidgy. &quot; Diana begins by answering his question about her day , New Year ' s Eve , 1989 , at Sandringham Castle : &quot; I was very bad at lunch . And I nearly started blubbing . I just felt really sad and empty , and I thought : ' Bloody hell , after all I ' ve done for this f- - -ing family. ' &quot; He calls her &quot; darling &quot; more_than 50 times in the rambling dialogue . But the general context seems to be that of courtship confidants rather than lovers . The story was splashed by the tabloids as &quot; Dianagate Tape of Love Reveals Marriage Misery &quot; and &quot; My Life Is Torture. &quot; The Squidgy tapes were soon overtaken by the devastating Camillagate recording . ( Who made the Dianagate and Camillagate tapes is a mystery , but there is widespread suspicion that they originated_in General Communications ' headquarters , a government_office that monitors radio and telephone transmissions. ) If Charles could have chosen one act , short of murder , to turn public_opinion against him , it would have been this . All his attempts at good works were forgotten . As Anthony Holden put it : &quot; No one listens to sermons about the rain_forests by a man who is said to be two-timing the world ' s most popular woman. &quot; &quot; It ' s incredible that he didn ' t have the courage to give_up Camilla , &quot; comments one London insider with connections to the royal_family , whose views were shared by many other women . &quot; He thinks he ' s living 50 years ago , when the Prince of Wales could get_away with mistresses . But not with Princess Diana . I think he ' s very , very wet , pathetic. &quot; A negative reaction was expressed by some of the Anglican clergy , since the_British monarch is temporal head of the Church_of_England and defender of the faith . The sharpest response came from George Austin , archdeacon of York , who declared , &quot; I fail to see how the church could tolerate somebody whose moral standards are of the kind his apparently are . . . . If his attitude to his vows was so cavalier , has he the right to be trusted ? &quot; The adultery charges even managed to bring into the open the long-simmering relationship between the church and monarch . As commentators are fond of noting , the Church_of_England had its genesis when King Henry_VIII decided to divorce and remarry but was refused by the Roman_Catholic Pope in Rome . Many officials believe the Church_of_England should no longer be the established church , since only about 2 % of the_British population are regular Anglican churchgoers . Poll after poll showed that the esteem of the royal_family was falling drastically ; people were questioning the future of the monarchy in Britain . No wonder the queen in November , 1992 , described the preceding 10 months as an &quot; annus horribilis , &quot; a horrible year . She was promptly criticized in the popular press for using Latin rather than the good old Queen ' s English . AS HE ATTEMPTS TO BECOME a kinder , gentler prince , Charles must make several concrete decisions as well . Charles and Diana can petition for divorce like any other British subjects , but a divorced prince may_not be allowed to ascend to the throne . If he wants to remarry , he would have to ask permission of the queen , who is supreme governor of a church that doesn ' t approve of divorce , for permission . Charles ' remarriage , particularly to a divorced woman , would create a constitutional crisis , as was the case with Edward_VIII , and he would probably have to renounce his right to the throne in favor of son William . Princess Diana could remarry without anyone ' s approval , but she would assume the rank of her next husband . If they don ' t divorce , &quot; Charles could remain Prince of Wales for another 20 or 25 years , &quot; says Holden . &quot; Will he really want to spend all that time being subject_to satire and criticism , becoming king at 70 for 10 years ? Or step aside , return to Highgrove full time and marry the woman he loves ? &quot; Meanwhile , Diana pursues a subplot in the royal soap_opera . Currently she has cut_back on public engagements , partly because , she has said , she needs to recover her privacy , but also , according to friends , because she doesn ' t want to be accused of upstaging Charles as he creates a new image . She is aware that she retains her popularity and hold_over the_British public in a way that Charles can ' t . She knows that many Britons agree with Tory MP Terry Dicks ' view : &quot; She would have made a far better queen than he will make a king. &quot; Diana is also concentrating_on raising her boys , 11-year-old William and Harry , 9 , helping them to adjust to contemporary life despite living_in the royal fishbowl . &quot; One of the reasons she is leaving public life , &quot; says Ingrid Seward , editor of Majesty magazine , &quot; is her concern over William . He ' s in a very sensitive , pre-adolescent growing period and has become much more introverted since the troubles. &quot; More skeptical observers like Holden believe that once the Prince of Wales has had his year of new imagery , Diana will return to the public_eye . &quot; She can come_back as mother of a future monarch , &quot; he says , &quot; a cross between a magazine cover_girl and Mother Teresa . This could be bad for him because everything she does makes him look absurd and eccentric . As if he still believes_in the divine right of kings . &quot; She is the one who captures the public ' s fancy with her real-life concerns . Diana is nobody ' s fool . She will continue to show the born royals the kind of royalty Britain wants , in a style they seem quite unable to master or even comprehend. &quot; Charles ' PR staff is hoping the new prince will fill that public desire before Diana makes her move . Charles and his aides are working_on public appearances that will peak in July with the 25th anniversary of his investiture as Prince of Wales . The ceremonies will tie_in with a BBC-TV documentary and an authorized biography , &quot; The Waiting Years , &quot; both by Jonathan Dimbleby . These are expected to be flattering , depicting Charles as mature and purposeful , and will emphasize what his friends say is his &quot; charming and witty private side , &quot; often lost from public view . The events are also intended to show that the monarchy , as a symbol of national continuity , is worth keeping . How well the_British public will warm_to the orchestrated attempt to present the Prince of Wales in a more caring and coherent light remains to be seen . A recent BBC poll in Wales on the eve of Charles ' visit showed that more_than half of those polled thought the prince was not doing a good job -- nor would he make a good king . Perhaps more ominous for his spin_doctors ' hopes was a recent BBC feature pegged to his March visit to Wales . Looking pained yet earnest , in response to a query on what was his goal , Charles rambled : &quot; I think , more_than anything else , what I ' m trying to do is to encourage a more holistic approach to many of the issues which I think are important . I happen to feel that since the 1960s , a great_deal of destructiveness has taken_place in terms of throwing the baby out with the bathwater , in many of the things that matter , certainly to me and I think to an awful lot of other people . All I want to do is put the baby back , which got chucked_out in the process . Which is one of the reasons why , for instance , I started my institute of architecture . Why I took an interest in architectural matters . Because again , I think it needs again a more holistic approach . Same thing with agriculture . I believe that a great_deal needs to be done there to create a more holistic approach . Same with medicine . So I believe that all these things are part of my particular approach to trying to bring the baby back with the bathwater having chucked the bathwater out. &quot; &quot; I think the TV_program was a disaster , &quot; says the Daily Mail ' s Richard Kay . &quot; And people at Buckingham Palace agree with me . He ' s not a natural TV performer . He came_across badly . He went_off on a tangent , and many in the audience didn ' t know what he was talking about. &quot; Social historian David Cannadine may have pinned_down Charles ' essential problem and therefore that of his handlers . &quot; The difficulty with the 20th-Century British monarchy , &quot; he says , &quot; is that it ' s more about ' being ' than ' doing , ' and every now and then someone has come_along who wants to do things rather than just be -- and that ' s obviously true of Charles . On the whole , people don ' t want British royals to do things , they just want them to be things , and the more Charles wants to do things the less likely he is to succeed , and the less likely people are to like him . The tragedy for him is that the harder he tries to do the job the way he understands it , the less public appreciation he ' s getting. &quot; Perhaps . But in the April interview with Hattersley , after all_the embarrassing phone taps , loony ramblings and adulterous exposes , Charles shared this view of royalty : &quot; The people want an institution that can be looked_up_to . If you become like everybody else , what is the purpose of having a monarchy ? &quot; CHARLES (</TEXT>
