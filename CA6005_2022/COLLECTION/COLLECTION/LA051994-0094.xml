   <HEADLINE> STOCKS RALLY FOR SECOND DAY , BUT DOLLAR STILL IN DOLDRUMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar tumbled against major currencies Wednesday after the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s increase in interest_rates failed to restore confidence in the U.S. currency . But stocks , still basking in the afterglow of the Fed ' s tough anti-inflation moves , staged a second-day rally . Yields on short-term Treasury securities fell further , but the tumbling dollar pushed_up long-term Treasury_bond yields -- disappointing investors hoping for an opposite reaction to the central_bank ' s action . Many traders expected the dollar to gain after the Fed raised its discount_rate on overnight loans to member_banks to 3.5 % from 3 % and lifted the federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 4.25 % from 3.75 % . Higher rates usually bolster the dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive .

The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller companies surged 10.38 points to 721.90. Wednesday ' s gains were more dramatic on the broader market , where advancing Big Board stocks outnumbered declining ones by more_than 2 to 1 and the trading pace was brisk . Volume on the NYSE floor came_to 337.67 million shares , up from 311.68 million on Tuesday . The total helped the NYSE surpass the $ 1-trillion level in the value of trades so far in 1994 . The exchange said it didn ' t reach that milestone last year until June 10 , and that was the earliest ever . In the bond market , the 30-year bond yield edged upward to close at 7.27 % from Tuesday ' s 7.26 % . Its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , fell 1 / 16 point , or 63 cents per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Prices of short-term Treasury securities , meanwhile , ranged from 3 / 16 point to 7 / 32 point higher , and intermediate maturities were 1 / 16 point to 1 / 4 point higher , the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported .

Its stock rose 1 / 16 to 11 3 / 8 . * Chevron tumbled 1 3 / 4 to 86 3 / 8 after Dean Witter Reynolds reduced estimated earnings for the energy concern .
