   <TEXT> The home air_base for U.S. planes flying over northern Iraq held a memorial service Sunday for the 26 people killed Thursday when U.S. jets mistakenly destroyed two U.S. helicopters over Iraq . Turks here expressed a mix of anger and sorrow over the deaths of three Turkish officers and American , British , French and Iraqi Kurdish passengers . The service at Incirlik Air_Base was closed to journalists . Civilians there said by telephone that the accident had cast a pall of disbelief over the community of 5 # 000 Americans . &quot; There ' s a great_deal of sadness , &quot; said Don Torrey , principal of the base ' s high_school . &quot; This morning the chaplain gave a very sorrowful prayer for the victims , for the people at the base , for the people who were part of it and for the investigating team. &quot; &quot; People are at_a_loss as_to how it could possibly happen , &quot; said Mary Davis , director of the elementary_school . &quot; Didn ' t ( the Blackhawk helicopters ) have U.S. markings ? It ' s just absolutely mind-boggling that it could happen. &quot; Among Turks in the neighboring city of Adana , &quot; everyone is sad and mad , &quot; said a man who would identify himself only as Yildren . &quot; Americans have such high_technology , it ' s hard to believe that you can make that kind of mistake. &quot; The widow of the senior Turkish officer killed Thursday , Col . Hikmet Alp , told the Turkish daily Hurriyet that she would sue the United States if the American pilots were found to have erred in the incident , the Associated Press reported . This is the second time in two years that Turkish soldiers have died from a U.S. military blunder . In October , 1992 , the U.S. aircraft_carrier Saratoga mistakenly fired two missiles into a Turkish destroyer , killing five and nearly sinking the ship . Some Turks later expressed resentment when the U.S. Navy did not court-martial those held responsible .</TEXT>
