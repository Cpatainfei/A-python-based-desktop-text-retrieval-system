   <HEADLINE> BILL BOYARSKY : TRYING CRIMINAL CASES IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC_OPINION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A lot of concern is being expressed about the impact of pretrial publicity on the O.J. Simpson murder case . On Friday , Superior_Court Judge Cecil J . Mills , saying grand jurors had been exposed to such pretrial publicity , halted their work while they were considering an indictment of Simpson . Just one day earlier , our top law_enforcement officials took a vow of silence after Los Angeles City Atty . James Hahn released the now-famous 911 tapes to news organizations that had requested them under the California Public Records Act . It was a little late . By the time prosecutors took the pledge , potential jurors all_over the county had heard or read the taped dialogue between a frightened Nicole Brown Simpson , the 911 operator and a man , identified as O.J. Simpson , cursing and screaming in the background . You may wonder why the tapes were released at all . Or why they were broadcast or printed . Or why prosecutors , cops and the defense have furnished so_much information to the news media since before Simpson ' s arrest . The reason is simple . This is the way the criminal justice system works . Even before presenting the case in the official court , each side battles in the court of public_opinion . This is done to create a favorable atmosphere in the community and to influence potential jurors . Both the prosecutors and the defense use the news media to reach this unofficial but important court . In addition , the press acts_as a watchdog , on the lookout for bungling or corrupt cops , attorneys and judges . For better or for worse , we in the news business are part of the process . This is not new . It ' s been going_on since the modern newspaper came_into existence in the late 19th Century . The process has been magnified and intensified by the immediacy and power of television . * I ' m an expert on pretrial publicity because that ' s what I used to do for a living . I started_out in the Wild_West newspaper world of the 1950s , working for the Oakland Tribune across the bay from San Francisco . The Tribune and the four San Francisco dailies fiercely competed on every big crime story . My paper had at least six editions a day , and when there was a hot murder , the editors wanted a new headline for each of them . The competition was especially rough when 14-year-old Stephanie Bryan vanished on her way home from junior_high_school in Berkeley . Suspicion quickly turned_to Burton Abbott , a 28-year-old University of California accounting major whose wife found Stephanie ' s wallet and purse in their basement . As a copy messenger , I watched from the sidelines as our star reporters battled their rivals on the other papers in a search for Stephanie . Her body was found by a reporter , Ed Montgomery of the San Francisco Examiner . He traveled_to the far Northern California mountains where the Abbotts had a summer cabin . He and a local rancher ' s team of dogs found the body buried about 100 yards from the cabin , a discovery that eventually sent Abbott to the gas_chamber . The story taught me about competition , a lesson I took with me when I was promoted to reporter . I worked in the old Oakland City_Hall , in a pressroom decorated with bullet_holes left by the cops who came_in at night to drink with the reporters . A big part of my job was covering the detectives . Trying to stay ahead , I worked hard at trying to develop inside sources . Deputy Chief Jack Brierly , in_charge of the detectives , was a friend of my boss and gave me inside_information . I also got news about the various accused suspects when I talked each morning with the Oakland Police_Department ' s top homicide detective , Lt . Hubert Murray . He ' s an ace investigator whom my colleague , Al Martinez , then a young Tribune reporter , called &quot; the Human Lie Detector. &quot; By the time the suspect was ready for trial , the cops ' case had pretty well been presented in the newspaper . This was somewhat balanced by tips and insights from media-wise defense_lawyers , who gained favor with the pressroom crew by sending them bottles of whiskey . I ' m sure civil libertarians , law_school professors and journalism ethicists look down on such practices . I , on the other hand , look_upon it as an education that gives me a unique perspective on the Simpson case and others like it . I am offended when incorrect information makes the news . But that ' s a question of accuracy , not the idea of reporters investigating a crime on_their_own , gathering information and , yes , accepting leaks from reliable unnamed sources . We need all_of that , and I ' ll tell you why . Although the defense , prosecution , cops and judges often fight in public , the criminal justice system is really a tight , elitist club . Its members don ' t want the press snooping around or the public let_in on the way the system works . The press is the public ' s representative in this process , breaking_through the secrecy in search of corruption , error and miscarriages of justice . There have been cases , not just in the movies , in which dedicated reporters have saved innocent men and women from the mistakes of bungling defense_attorneys , overzealous prosecutors and bad judges . Reporters have also found evidence overlooked by the criminal justice system , just the way the Examiner ' s Ed Montgomery did with his dogs . The publicity this week got me thinking_about all I ' ve learned since my first job and those morning talks with Lt . Murray , the Human Lie_Detector . What would I do , I wondered , if I were reporting the Simpson story and a latter-day Hubie Murray , a person of the same reliability and honesty , leaked some important information to me . Would I say : &quot; Lieutenant , stop , I don ' t want to listen to you . You are violating my journalistic ethics &quot; ? Today ' s ethicists frown_on anonymous sources or buddying up_to cops . Not a chance . I ' d take_notes , read his reports , do more reporting , and if the information checked_out , call my boss and say : &quot; I ' ve got a hell of a story. &quot;</TEXT>
