   <HEADLINE> DELTA CUTS AIRCRAFT TYPE TO SAVE MONEY ; AIRLINES : THE CARRIER EXPECTS TO GAIN $ 100 MILLION A YEAR BY ELIMINATING 13 AIRBUS A-310S FROM ITS FLEET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Delta Air Lines Inc. , seeking to cut costs in an increasingly competitive airline market , expects to save $ 100 million a year by removing its 13 Airbus A-310 aircraft from its fleet . &quot; that ' s about $ 100 million a year savings right there , eliminating one airplane type , the inventory that goes_with that , the training and so forth , &quot; Chief_Executive Ronald Allen said in an interview Wednesday . Delta , the nation ' s third-largest airline , said Tuesday that it would remove the planes as part of its program to return to sustained profitability . The company also said Tuesday that its profit improvement plan , aimed at reducing costs by $ 700 million over three years , is a year ahead of schedule . In addition , it said it will eliminate 2 # 500 jobs over the next 12 months as it reshapes its technical operations division . As a means of cutting expenses , Delta is examining all its aircraft and may further simplify its fleet over the next couple of years , Allen said . The airline has 13 different types of aircraft in its fleet , excluding the Airbus A-310 planes . &quot; We will probably still have too many types of planes -- not too many planes , but too many types -- so we must address that , &quot; he said , adding that Delta will probably begin to replace its Lockheed L10-11 aircraft in the next few years . The fleet simplification plan is part of Delta ' s goal to slash annual operating_costs by approximately $ 2 billion by June , 1997 , in_order to compete with lower-cost carriers . Delta recently reported a loss for the fiscal third quarter ended April 29 of $ 77.9 million , or $ 2.10 a share , on revenue of $ 2.94 billion . This loss was narrowed from the year-earlier quarter , when it had a loss of $ 152.3 million , or $ 3.61 a share , on revenue of $ 2.93 billion . Allen also said Delta expects to revamp its short-haul operations . &quot; I think there will be some changes in the way we serve the short-haul . . . . We may wind_up with what appears to be a separate kind of branded product in the short-haul market , &quot; he said . Delta said in April that it would not form a separate short-haul unit and instead would cut costs throughout the airline . However , Delta is closely examining short-haul operations and wants to increase plane utilization and may also revamp service on those flights , Allen said .</TEXT>
