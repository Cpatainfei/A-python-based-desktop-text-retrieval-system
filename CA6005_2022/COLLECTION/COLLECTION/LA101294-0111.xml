   <HEADLINE> TWO AMERICANS , GERMAN WIN NOBEL IN ECONOMICS ; PRIZE : BERKELEY PROFESSOR AMONG HONOREES FOR GAME_THEORY . IDEA LINKS DECISION-MAKING FROM POKER TO PRICING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three economists , two Americans and a German colleague , were awarded the Nobel Prize Tuesday for their work_on a theory that explores human behavior in settings ranging from a poker_game to the corporate suite in an increasingly global marketplace . The winners -- John C . Harsanyi of UC Berkeley , John F . Nash of Princeton_University and Reinhard Selten of the University of Bonn -- are scholars of game_theory , which applies complex logic to real-world scenarios of conflict and competition . These include military strategy , politics and sports in addition to a broad range of business problems . &quot; Eventually it will give us a higher standard_of_living because we make better decisions , &quot; Harsanyi , 74 , said from his home_in Berkeley , because the theory can lead to &quot; better economic decisions by business and government. &quot; Across the Atlantic_Ocean , Harsanyi ' s former collaborator , Selten , 64 , was almost apologetic about the esoteric nature of his specialty . &quot; I have worked a long_time in the field of mathematical economic_theory , and everything to do with mathematics is difficult to understand for many , &quot; he told reporters . A key to the theory is the notion that if you can understand the strategies of all your rivals , you gain insight into the outcome of a situation and the potential benefits , economists said Tuesday . Unlike textbook economics , which is often divorced from the real_world , game_theory assumes that people get tangled up in knotty , interactive situations that may be filled with bluffs , second-guessing and bold gambles . Complex scenarios are typically spewed out of a computer in the language of mathematics . In citing the winners , the Royal Swedish Academy said the three had employed strategies observed in games like chess and poker to make predictions about the interaction between companies . &quot; Everyone knows that in these games , players have to think ahead -- devise a strategy based on expected countermoves from the other player ( s ) , &quot; the judges said . At a Princeton_University press_conference , Nash joked that he wished the $ 930 # 000 prize were bigger because it had to be divided three ways . But Nash , 66 , said he was &quot; thrilled to receive this high honor. &quot; In the 1940s , military analysts used early game_theory as a tool to help guide U.S. ships in the perilous journey across the Atlantic_Ocean . Later it was incorporated into Cold_War thinking , such_as in U.S. nuclear strategy against the Soviets . But scholars have always appreciated the economic implications , which seem well suited to a world of far-flung corporations and fierce economic competition . Increasingly since the 1970s , business strategists have built_upon the theoretical foundations of game_theory to tackle issues involving pricing , bidding for contracts and other strategies . Airlines use it during price_wars to calculate their rivals ' plans and determine which course of action will prove most profitable . Companies may use it in making decisions about a new product , to boost their advantage over the competition . The impending government auction for airwaves to be used by new telecommunications_equipment provides a case_in_point . Prospective buyers for the coveted space on the radio_spectrum are trying to figure_out how much to bid for which portions of the spectrum and in what regions of the country . &quot; Every serious bidder in the auction is hiring a game theorist to help them figure_out their strategy , &quot; said Carl Shapiro , a professor of business strategy at UC Berkeley . Game_theory also is transforming the way many people think_about the economy . Textbook economic_theory &quot; is about an isolated Robinson Crusoe-like individual coping_with scarcity , &quot; observed Samuel Bowles , an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts . Game_theory , by contrast , &quot; is always about two or more people , and they are coping strategically with their interdependence. &quot; It is a &quot; very appropriate theory in the late 20th Century , in which the world of ( individual ) lemonade-stand capitalism increasingly is a textbook illusion. &quot; The Swedish academy Tuesday singled_out Princeton ' s Nash for refining the &quot; Nash Equilibrium , &quot; a formula for understanding how people compete in situations where they have knowledge about each other ' s positions . &quot; The Nash Equilibrium has become a standard tool in almost all areas of economic_theory in_order to improve our understanding of complex strategic interaction , &quot; the academy said . Selten , who co-authored a book with Harsanyi , built_upon Nash ' s work and applied it to certain forms of economic competition , such_as when there are only a_few sellers of a particular product . Harsanyi helped pave the way for the emerging field of the economics of information through his research into how games of incomplete information can be analyzed . &quot; I was woken_up by the telephone at 4:45 in the morning -- and I thought either a friend had a bad accident or they were calling to tell me about the Nobel Prize . Luckily it was the Nobel , &quot; said Harsanyi , a Berkeley professor emeritus . His work broadened the theory ' s use in the commercial world , he explained , because &quot; in real_life , people very seldom have full knowledge &quot; about their rivals . Harsanyi also was praised for &quot; significant contributions to the foundations of welfare economics. &quot; For all its aura of complexity , game_theory applies to situations and strategies that people may intuitively comprehend , scholars said . It is at_work when a parent tries to outsmart a child who is trying to guess which hand the parent has hidden a coin in . It also is used on the football_field , when the offense picks a play_on fourth down and the defense has a plan to smother it . &quot; It ' s a tool that enables us to predict how people will react under certain rules of the game , &quot; explained Hayne Leland , a professor of finance at Berkeley . Times staff writer Marjorie Miller in Bonn contributed to this story . * PEACE PRIZE LEAK : Newspaper says Yasser Arafat , Yitzhak Rabin will win . A16 Winning Team John C . Harsanyi , John F . Nash and Reinhard Selten were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics today by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . The three professors were singled_out for their unique contributions to game_theory . WHAT IS GAME_THEORY ? Game_theory is derived from studies of games such_as poker or chess . Players have to think ahead and devise a strategy based on expected countermoves from opponents . This type of strategic interaction characterizes many situations , and therefore game_theory has become a very useful tool for analyzing economic and other issues . Banks have used the theory to set monetary policies ; politicians use it to help choose platforms to garner votes , and biologists have used it to help understand animal behavior . John C . Harsanyi * Born May 29 , 1920 , in Budapest , Hungary * PhD . from Stanford_University in 1959 * Professor at UC Berkeley : worked for 18 years with Selten on &quot; A General Theory of Equilibrium Selection in Games , &quot; a book published in 1988 . John F . Nash * Born in 1928 in Bluefield , W.Va. * PhD . from Princeton_University in 1950 * Visiting research collaborator , Princeton_University ; developed &quot; Nash Equilibrium , &quot; a formula for determining when it is pointless for a game player to change strategy . Reinhard Selten * Born Oct . 5 , 1930 , in Breslau , Germany * Ph . D from Frankfurt University in 1961 * Professor at the University of Bonn ; credited with being the first to refine the Nash Equilibrium concept and apply it to particular events .
