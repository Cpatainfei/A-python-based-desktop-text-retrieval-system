   <HEADLINE> WILL BOSNIA PRY THE U.S. FROM NATO ? ; CONGRESS MAY DRAW ITS OWN LESSONS FROM EUROPEAN POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Haiti is_on the foreign-policy front burner now , of course . On the back burner , Bosnia simmers on and may come_to a brief boil in mid-October . But the unwatched pot that may yet boil_over is NATO . The Clinton_Administration is now caught between the Bosnian preferences of Congress and those of our major European allies . Britain and France , in_effect , see the creation of a new &quot; Serboslavia &quot; as the path to stability in the region . They furiously oppose the majority in Congress that wants the United States unilaterally to lift its arms embargo on official Bosnia-Herzegovina . The German foreign_minister , Klaus Kinkel , has lately joined his British and French colleagues . Bosnian Serb leaders have rejected the peace proposal that was put forth by the United Nations and ferociously escalated their &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; of northeast Bosnia . The astonishing European response to this new aggression has been a campaign to begin easing sanctions against Serbia . The U.N. Security_Council did exactly that last week , lifting embargoes on air_travel , cultural and sports exchanges with the rump Yugoslav government , though it did vote economic sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs and forbade their leaders to visit other nations . Bosnian Serbs in turn halted U.N. convoys and threatened retaliation for a NATO air_raid . Though Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic publicly opposes the Bosnian Serb rejection of the United Nations ' peace plan , his country continues privately to supply and otherwise assist the Bosnian Serbs . Rather than expose Milosevic , however , the &quot; contact group &quot; of four European powers ( Russia is the fourth ) plus the United States recently chose to provide him the cover of token international monitoring of the Serbian-Bosnian border : 135 monitors , far too few to cover the long border , and all under tight Serbian supervision . As the U.N. Security_Council rewards Milosevic ' s &quot; cooperation , &quot; Bosnian Serb aggression will only continue to escalate . Congress ' view that Serb aggression must be halted by the stick rather than the carrot , by strengthening the Bosnian military deterrent rather than by enriching the Serbian economy , is far more realistic . However , realism also dictates that the United States not pursue a European policy in defiance of our three most powerful European allies . The Administration has set Oct . 15 as a deadline for the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan . When that date comes the Administration will most probably ask the 15-nation U.N. Security_Council to lift the arms embargo on the Muslim-led Bosnians . France , Britain , China , New Zealand , Spain , Argentina and the Czech Republic will abstain . Veto-wielding Russia will oppose . The United States ' request will be denied . Thus will Europe have won in its struggle with the U.S. Congress . But Congress may be prepared to make virtue of this necessity . The moral that Congress may draw is that a U.S. withdrawal from formal European collective_security may be an idea whose time has come . A growing number in Congress may say : Yes , let France , Germany and Britain handle post-Cold War Yugoslavia on_their_own . But let them also handle post-Cold War Russia on_their_own . They have all_the money , troops and weapons they need for the job . Europe will not , in a major way , assist the United States in handling North_Korea or Cuba or Haiti or other security problems defined as Washington ' s alone . Congress may wish to introduce a kind of parity . European , particularly British , comment on U.S. solicitude for the Bosnian Muslims has typically faulted it as moralism from afar and on the cheap . But the U.S. appetite for the role of world moralist , much less world policeman , is smaller than such commentators think . The risk is that Europe ' s attitude toward Bosnia may yet become America ' s attitude -- toward Europe .</TEXT>
