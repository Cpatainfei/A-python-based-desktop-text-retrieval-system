   <TEXT> Part of the problem was the buildings . No , not problem . Elizabeth Monk Daley hates the word problem . &quot; Let ' s say , a real challenge , which is by far the better word , &quot; says the dean of the USC School of Cinema-Television . OK . So the school had this real challenge -- overcoming the impact of a cluster of campus buildings named after such industry mucky-mucks and USC supporters as George Lucas and Johnny Carson . &quot; You look_at the names on the buildings and you say , ' USC Cinema ' s a real rich school. ' Well , hello . It ' s not. &quot; Indeed , when Daley became the nation ' s first female film school dean in May , 1991 , USC Cinema was lugging an $ 800 # 000 deficit . Endowment ? Ha . And now , a mere 3 1 / 2 years later , it has not only paid_off the deficit , but it ' s more_than $ 8 million closer to its $ 60-million endowment goal . How ? &quot; A lot of help from our friends , &quot; she says somewhat demurely . In other words , by doing what the industry does best -- networking . And Daley is a networker par excellence . In her relatively short stint as dean , she has parlayed her talent for it into a bouquet of forward-looking changes for USC . For her trouble , USC recently gave her a second top job -- as executive_director of the new Annenberg Center for Communication . The center was spawned last year with a $ 120-million grant from media mogul and former Ambassador Walter Annenberg to nurture research and teaching about new and interactive media . Daley , selected from more_than 30 candidates , was prized for her film and television experience and contacts , USC President Steven Sample says . &quot; The other thing Dean Daley has in my judgment is her great vision , &quot; he says . &quot; I think more_than any other person I ' ve ever met , she can articulate and understands what ' s happening in this communications revolution . She has a great ability to inspire and motivate other people. &quot; Under Daley ' s tenure , the film school , which she continues to head , has done more with its money than sock it away . It has wooed advice and financial_support from a wide swath of industry professionals ; made the first university-produced feature-length motion_picture ; hired a former William Morris agent to help ease students ' transition into the real_world , and attracted a $ 2-million donation from Time Warner Inc. to endow the dean ' s chair and get her salary off the annual operating tab of $ 21 million . Chunks of the curriculum also have been turned_on their heads : USC has cross-fertilized new programs and degrees with the engineering and business_schools ; founded a master ' s degree_program for computer animators , and established a seminar series for minority screenwriters . Even industry grown-ups are being invited to share USC Cinema ' s glimpse into the next century : The school recently formed the Entertainment Technology Center , a think_tank of pros in entertainment , computers and technology that ' s looking_at new ways to join forces . One embryonic ETC blueprint targeted at the film_industry , Holly Net , would consolidate a wide range of motion_picture services in a computer_database . The plan is for USC to help provide long-term R &amp; D for Hollywood , which tends to be focused_on short-term goals and profits . &quot; It ' s extremely important to me that we constantly have our finger on the pulse of what ' s going_on out there , &quot; Daley says , &quot; and that we ' re taking a long-term look_at where this industry ' s headed and that we ' re making sure that everybody who leaves here is ready for the next 10 , 15 , 20 years. &quot; Her approach appears to be paying_off . Last spring , USC and New York University tied as the nation ' s top film schools , according to the U.S. News &amp; World Report Annual Guide to America ' s Best Graduate_Schools , which weighs scholarship , curriculum and quality of faculty . USC Cinema , shepherding more_than 900 students a year , has graduated such industry luminaries as Ron Howard , James Ivory , Robert Zemeckis and David Wolper . One industry executive recruited by Daley to help steer the ETC lays much of the credit for USC Cinema ' s latest advances at the dean ' s feet . &quot; I always say that figuring_out what to do is 5 % of the assignment and figuring_out how to do_it and getting_it done is 95 % , and she ' s really great at both but particularly at getting_it done , &quot; says Steven Koltai , Warner Bros . senior_vice_president for corporate strategic planning and development . &quot; She has a way of dealing with people and motivating people that is quite extraordinary. &quot; Even Daley ' s office bears evidence of someone who focuses_on other people . Emmy nomination plaques lining a wall honor &quot; Tell Them I ' m a Mermaid &quot; and &quot; Who Parks in Those Spaces , &quot; TV documentaries about the disabled that she produced for Taper Media Enterprises in the mid- ' 80s . Daley , 51 , is equally unassuming , given to easy smiles and conservative suits in muted colors . A faint lilt in her voice betrays her Dallas beginnings . Perhaps not surprisingly , Daley ' s mother was a teacher , now retired . What is surprising , though , is that her mother ' s experience initially turned Daley off to a career in education . She had a ringside view of the difficulties of living on a paltry teacher ' s salary after her father , a housing contractor , died when she was 12 . &quot; This woman did not have an easy life , &quot; Daley says of her mother . &quot; And I can remember saying as a little_girl that I would never teach . But obviously a university ' s a little different situation . They take much better care of us. &quot; Still , Dean Daley is very much her mother ' s child . &quot; It wasn ' t teaching as much as she was very interested in theater and she did a lot of storytelling . My earliest memories with her are of being taken_places to tell stories . She would go tell stories in hospitals and drag me along and let me tell part of the story. &quot; Daley studied theater at Tulane University , and then took_off for Paris for a year during which she studied mime and commedia dell ' arte with Jacques LeCoq and acting at the Comedie Francaise . When she returned to the tumultuous United States in 1965 , Daley pursued a doctorate in theater , with a minor in film , at the University of Wisconsin at Madison . There , she hid from the furor surrounding the Vietnam_War , a climate that helped breed her concern for social problems . She followed her first husband to Washington , D.C. , where she helped set_up an experimental theater program for the Wolftrap Foundation . From there , Daley segued into experimentation with video , forming Videocraft , an independent producer of documentaries for public television , the federal_government and the private sector . By the mid- ' 70s , Daley was divorced and raising her daughter , Shannon , now a 24-year-old clinical_psychology student working toward a doctorate at UCLA . She met her current husband , American Film Institute Deputy Director James Hindman , while they were teaching at American University , Daley ' s professional home from 1978-82 . Daley and Hindman recognized , however , that their TV and film production opportunities would be limited in Washington . When AFI offered Hindman a job in Los Angeles in 1982 , they shipped their careers west -- they now live_in Santa Monica -- and Daley spent five years producing TV movies and specials for Taper Media Enterprises . That company was swallowed by MGM / UA Television , and Daley developed a_couple_of HBO movies for it before launching her own production company in 1988 . Daley / Hodges Productions has developed cable-TV movies . * It was while Daley was finishing a project for MGM that people started calling her with the same proposition . &quot; A friend called and said , ' You know you ' re always talking_about how important you think it is for women and minorities to be more involved in the industry and about new kinds of creative work getting done. &quot; Rather than take another studio deal , would she consider USC ' s opening for a production program chair ? Daley initially balked at the idea , then remembered that she ' d been impressed by the USC interns she had worked with . &quot; They knew that they weren ' t supposed to direct the picture , but they would put_on their gloves before they touched a hot light , &quot; she says . &quot; And there was a professionalism about them that I really liked. &quot; So after a USC recruiter called , Daley agreed to join the school in 1989 as chair of the Film and Television Production Program . &quot; I like the ethics of the place . I liked the sense of the ethical responsibility of media . I also liked their sense_of_responsibility to another generation . &quot; And it ' s a pretty phenomenal legacy . You know , this place is 65 years old . And when you look_at the filmmakers they ' ve turned_out , you thought , ' Well , if there ' s a chance to kind of shepherd that and keep that going , that ' s really a very worthwhile thing to spend some time doing. ' &quot; At the end of her first year , then-Dean Frank Daniel resigned to return to screenwriting . &quot; The next thing I was in the provost office with him saying , ' Your colleagues think you ought to be dean of this school , ' &quot; she says . &quot; It was just such an overwhelming mandate from the faculty to do it. &quot; Daley became dean and quickly went_to work . Her top priority was to recruit a board of councilors , a band of the industry ' s heaviest_hitters who could help with fund-raising , networking and carving out school policy to keep USC in tune with the needs of the business . She picked_up the phone and asked_for a meeting with producer Ray Stark because he ' d endowed USC ' s Peter Stark Motion_Picture Producing Program , named after his son who died in 1970 . Stark picked_up the phone and called producer and former Columbia Pictures chief Frank Price , who agreed to see Daley . Price picked_up the phone and lined_up a board , which includes among its 16 members David Geffen , George Lucas , Steven Spielberg , Brandon Tartikoff , Marvin Davis and David Wolper . Voila . * Price , who chairs the board , applauds Daley ' s ability to recruit people to the cause . &quot; I liked what she had to say about her approach to the school , &quot; Price says . &quot; I was particularly interested in her attitudes about making_sure that there would be a great emphasis on recruiting women and minorities for the student body. &quot; Indeed , the board ' s makeup illustrates the problem . Much like the industry itself , the panel is made_up , except for Sidney Poitier and Marcy Carsey , of white_men . The board is &quot; mostly guys and it ' s mostly white , &quot; Daley says . &quot; And one of the goals of the board when they begin to set_out their mission , and one of the reasons they ' re anxious to raise endowment , is they firmly believe as I do that this school is one of the major gateways into this industry . &quot; About 75 % of our grads walk straight out of here into Hollywood . Now if we can diversify the school , then we have somehow begun to diversify this industry . And yes , it ' s ethically right to diversify it . It ' s also just darn good business. &quot; Key to that strategy is raising endowment , so the school can depend less on its steep tuition and offer more financial_aid . Tuition is $ 16 # 000 a year , and students are told to expect to spend $ 25 # 000 figuring in living expenses . Even with USC Cinema far short of its endowment goal -- which yields interest that ultimately frees up funds for the operating budget -- 70 % of the students receive financial_aid toward tuition . &quot; At this point , we ' re very heavily tuition-dependent , &quot; Daley says , &quot; which means that if I get a terrific minority student walking in the door or a terrific -- doesn ' t have to be a minority -- a terrific student walking in the door who I ' d really like to fund , I often don ' t have the flexibility to do that . And what endowment provides you is stability . Otherwise , it ' s much too volatile a situation. &quot; So last June , USC Cinema saw_to_it that a chunk of the industry suited up for a 65th anniversary benefit , the first fund-raising bash in recent memory . Art Buchwald spoke . Eight hundred supporters ate chicken . Benefit co-chair Steven Spielberg regaled the audience even though USC Cinema had rejected him because of crummy grades : &quot; Standards were so high that many of today ' s finest filmmakers were unable to attend. &quot; One who slipped_in was George Lucas , among the school ' s most prominent supporters , who was given the first USC Award for Leadership in the Entertainment_Industry that evening . Lucas had spearheaded a $ 12-million fund-raising_drive a decade earlier to build five of the seven buildings in the Cinema complex , and Daley ' s award presentation patted the school ' s back as well as that of its illustrious alum . &quot; In nearly every year since 1950 at least one USC graduate has been nominated for an Academy Award , &quot; she told the black-tied crowd at the Beverly Hilton , trotting_out the school ' s favorite stats . &quot; Ten of the 12 highest-grossing films have had USC alumni in key creative and / or production positions . . . . George Lucas is one of the best measures of the efficacy of ( USC ' s ) educational philosophy . He once said of USC that , ' almost everything I learned , I learned there. ' &quot; Daley said something else that night revealing about her deanship : &quot; In celebrating the school , we celebrate cinema -- USC and the film_industry are inextricably intertwined . We intend , and have every reason to believe , that it will remain so. &quot; * That wasn ' t always the case . Marcia Rodrigues , a film editor and former wife of Lucas who had also been_active in the capital construction drive , was given no voice in the school ' s direction until Daley called her six months into her tenure as dean . &quot; Wow , &quot; Rodrigues thought . &quot; It ' s about time. &quot; They met at a San Francisco restaurant and Rodrigues jumped at the chance to rewrite her educational script for new generations . &quot; After the students leave with their degrees in_hand , they ' re just cut loose in a big cold world that couldn ' t care less , &quot; Rodrigues says . &quot; So we had lots of discussions about what could be done to help bridge that gap . &quot; My second concern was that many , many , many of the film students want to work_on motion_pictures , and it ' s really unfortunate that the school can ' t provide them with that experience because of limited funding and a_zillion reasons. &quot; Then Rodrigues put donations where her mouth was . She gives USC more_than $ 100 # 000 a year to fund the office of Larry Auerbach , a veteran of the William Morris Agency who advises students on making the leap to the real_world . She also donated $ 1 million toward the first full-length feature_film ever financed by a university and intended for public distribution . That project is still in post-production and title-testing , but Rodrigues has already kicked_in another million for a second feature . Auerbach , who has observed Daley ' s leadership style since he joined the school two years ago , says one of her strengths is her ability to work a room . &quot; She fights hard to get the money out of the university to run the school properly , &quot; he says . &quot; She ' s tough but good . I see the company she keeps_in the university , and I think that ' s important . You ' ve got_to move_around , and when you need help you know where to go , and she reaches_out and gets it. &quot; * But Daley doesn ' t just court bigwigs . Says Bob Laws , a graduate_student in production who works as an assistant in the dean ' s office : &quot; She ' s very busy and she deals with very high-powered people , but she always has time to listen to me and to my comments about the curriculum. &quot; For Daley , running a film school is like making a movie -- it ' s a collaborative venture . Some observers have wondered whether it ' s too collaborative , whether it stifles creativity to bring the full commercial weight of Hollywood to bear_on budding careers . &quot; You know , I get asked questions ( by other academics ) like , am I embarrassed by our close relationship to Hollywood ? The answer is , ' No , not at all. ' &quot; I think people ought to experiment . And we try to encourage people to take chances . The message you really want to get_across is that trying to duplicate what Hollywood is doing this year probably is not even the best way to be successful in a commercial career . You know , Frank Price has pointed_out that he didn ' t make ' Boyz N the Hood ' because it was like what was made last year . He made_it because he saw a unique and original voice in ( USC grad John ) Singleton . &quot; And the message I really want to get_across is not to be experimental or commercial . It ' s to find your own voice. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Elizabeth Monk Daley Age : 51 . Native ? : No ; born in Dallas , lives in Santa Monica . Family : Married to James Hindman , deputy director of the American Film Institute . One daughter , Shannon Daley , 24 , a clinical_psychology graduate_student at UCLA . Passions : Movies , natch ; her new getaway in Taos , N.M. , and exotic travel . &quot; My husband and I spent last summer in Burma , Thailand , Laos and Cambodia . We did some lectures in Burma and visited with filmmakers , but the rest of it was truly because we love to get_to know other cultures. &quot; On courting Hollywood for cash : &quot; People understand that when you fund something like USC , it ' s not really charity . You ' re investing in the future of your industry . And this is something we need to do . If you want a next generation , you ' ve got_to pay_for it. &quot; On &quot; enlightened self-interest &quot; : &quot; Enlightened self-interest is a real good thing . And I mean enlightened is the operative word . If you ' ve got a great script and somebody ' s looking_for a project , you serve each other very well . It ' s a win-win situation . When we get companies in here and they give us equipment and money and they help us , it ' s a win-win situation . We win ; we educate our students better . They win big-time because they get product loyalty . They get good feedback on their equipment . And they ' ve usually met the future filmmakers. &quot; On running the show : &quot; One of the secrets of good stewardship is to be sure , when you have people who want to help you , that you find ways that are meaningful to them to let them help you , instead of trying to tell them what they should be doing. &quot;</TEXT>
