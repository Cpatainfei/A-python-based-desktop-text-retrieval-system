   <HEADLINE> BID TO PROBE TOBACCO PETITIONS DENIED ; COURTS : JUDGE RULES THAT CHECKING FOR DECEPTION , AS CHARGED BY ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE TONY MILLER , WOULD BE AN UNWARRANTED INTRUSION INTO THE INITIATIVE PROCESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Superior_Court judge refused Friday to allow acting Secretary_of_State Tony Miller to question signers of a tobacco company-sponsored smoking initiative to see if they were duped , as Miller contends . Judge John R . Lewis concluded that Miller ' s request to check for deliberate deception by petition circulators is &quot; an unwarranted intrusion into the initiative process. &quot; If , as Miller charges , there is evidence of fraud , the complaints can be turned_over to local prosecutors or the attorney_general , said Lewis , who found no legal authority to grant Miller ' s request . Miller alleged that a Philip Morris-financed committee , Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions , intentionally deceived petition signers by telling them the measure would strengthen smoking restrictions . Actually , Miller said , its chief purpose is to abolish existing local smoking bans . Following the judge ' s ruling , Miller said he would not file an appeal because he must decide by June 30 whether the petition has received the 423 # 473 valid signatures needed for it to qualify for the November ballot . Millers said he will , however , call_for &quot; truth in sponsorship &quot; legislation to ensure that citizens know who is behind any petition they are asked to sign . Currently , state law requires identification of the chief sponsors of initiatives to be identified on mass mailings and in official reports , but not on the petitions . Miller also said he would refer numerous complaints of deception he has received to local district_attorneys in the various counties , but Miller said he did not expect prosecutions . &quot; The D.A.s have other priorities , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' re busy prosecuting violent crime. &quot; Supporters of the initiative have said Miller raised the issue to promote his candidacy for secretary_of_state . On Tuesday , Miller won the Democratic nomination for the post and will face Republican Assemblyman Bill Jones of Fresno in November . The chief legal issue before the court was whether Miller should be given access to names randomly chosen from the 607 # 000 signatures gathered by the initiative committee . Since 1972 , when signers of an initiative to legalize marijuana charged that they were harassed by police , state law has protected the confidentiality of names on petitions . County election officials have access to the names to check the validity of the signatures , but other officials must apply to the court to see them . John Mueller , an attorney representing the initiative committee , told the judge that &quot; the express purpose of this statute was to protect people ' s right to privacy. &quot; To grant access to the names in this case &quot; would set an extremely dangerous precedent &quot; he said , and would have a chilling effect on the rights of those wishing to circulate or sign initiative petitions . But Pamela S . Giarrizzo , staff attorney for the secretary_of_state ' s office , argued : &quot; We don ' t believe there would be a chilling effect on signers of petitions . We do think it will have a chilling effect on crooked circulators. &quot;</TEXT>
