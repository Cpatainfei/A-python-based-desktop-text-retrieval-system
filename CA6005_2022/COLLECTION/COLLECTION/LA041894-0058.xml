   <HEADLINE> SINGLE CURRENCY IS POSSIBLE BY 1999 , EU COMMISSIONER SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The European Union could introduce a single currency before 1999 even though member countries are currently experiencing economic problems like bulging public deficits , said European Commission Vice-President Henning Christophersen . &quot; Our models show that with reasonable economic_growth and some efforts by member states , a majority of member states will comply with the criteria concerning public finances in 1998 , &quot; Christophersen said . The EU ' s 12 member countries can decide to create a single currency between 1997 and 1999 , according to the timetable set by the Maastricht Treaty on political and monetary union . They must first meet a number of criteria , including low inflation and low budget_deficits , which are currently satisfied only by the tiny grand-duchy of Luxembourg . &quot; It ' s too soon to conclude from the present state of member states ' public finances &quot; that the EU won ' t establish a single currency before 1999 , he said at a meeting on European monetary union . &quot; We ' ve seen too many examples of rapid improvement for that , &quot; he said , citing Ireland and Denmark . The Maastricht Treaty says a country ' s budget_deficit mustn ' t exceed 3 % of its gross_domestic_product . The economic slowdown affecting most of the EU has curtailed state revenue and increased deficits . Speaking at the same conference , French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said the treaty was &quot; very flexible &quot; about a core_group of countries moving separately toward a single currency . &quot; that ' s not an institutional problem , &quot; said Alphandery . &quot; The Treaty in that respect is very flexible. &quot;</TEXT>
