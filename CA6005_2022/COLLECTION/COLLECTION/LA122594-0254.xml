   <HEADLINE> GUNMEN SEIZE PARIS-BOUND JET IN ALGERIA ; NORTH AFRICA : HIJACKERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE MUSLIM EXTREMISTS . SOME OF 283 ABOARD FLIGHT ARE RELEASED . TWO ARE REPORTED KILLED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four gunmen be lieved to be Muslim extremists seized a Paris-bound French jet filled with holiday travelers Saturday and killed two of them , Algeria ' s Interior minister said . The leader of the hijackers was identified as Abdul Abdallah Yahia of the Armed Islamic Group , Algeria ' s most violent and radical fundamentalist group . France Info Radio said the hijackers demanded the release of Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj , the two top leaders of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front , a more moderate fundamentalist group . Madani and Belhadj are being held by Algerian authorities under house_arrest after being released earlier this year from Blida prison where they were serving 12-year sentences for activities against the state . The hijacking of the plane and its 283 occupants came nearly three years after Muslim fundamentalists began their revolt against the nation ' s military-backed government . The hijackers had freed at least 57 hostages by Saturday evening , officials said . One freed hostage said the gunmen had handed_out veils for women to cover their heads . The gunmen demanded that the plane take_off for an undisclosed destination , said Interior Minister Abderrahmane Meziane-Cherif . He declined to elaborate . * Those killed were an Algerian policeman who was a passenger on the plane and another person , Cherif said . Their bodies were dumped out of the plane . Six gunshots were heard late Saturday night , but it was not clear who did the firing . Airport sources said negotiations were under way . In two hijackings that ended peacefully in Spain earlier this year , the release of jailed fundamentalist leaders was demanded but rejected . Passengers were being released in small groups . Most of them were women and children . &quot; I crossed two bodies while leaving the plane , &quot; said a young_woman who had been freed . She said the men &quot; are armed , they are holding Muslim prayers and handed_out veils for the women to cover their heads. &quot; There were conflicting reports about how the men commandeered the plane . An Air France spokesman in Paris said the group , dressed as ground personnel , first blocked the Airbus jetliner at Algiers ' Houari Boumedienne Airport shortly before it was to leave , then boarded it . Airport sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the men got_on the plane while passengers were boarding . The flight had 271 passengers and 12 crew_members aboard as it prepared to depart at 11:15 a.m. , Air France said . * Security_forces and firefighters took_up positions around the airliner , and the airport was shut_down and evacuated , officials said . The plane was parked about 300 yards from the terminal . Most of the passengers were Algerian . About 20 were French nationals , one was Tunisian , one Chinese and one Vietnamese , Cherif said . Two French diplomats also were said to be aboard , but a French Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to confirm the report . In Paris , worried friends and family members of the passengers gathered at Orly Airport late Saturday . The Muslim insurgency against the government in the former French colony has claimed more_than 11 # 000 lives . It began in January , 1992 , when the army canceled elections that a Muslim party was expected to win . More_than 70 foreigners have been killed since insurgents began targeting them in September , 1993 , in an attempt to drive_out the foreign capital and expertise that support Algeria ' s oil_industry . Deadly clashes between militants and security_forces have increased in recent months , and blackouts have hit the capital in the past week . Security_forces said they killed 40 more militants between Tuesday and Friday . The U.S. State_Department issued an advisory Friday urging Americans to stay out of the North African_nation . Air France has stepped_up its security in recent months , leaving only two foreign employees and no planes in Algeria overnight . Air France canceled its flights to Algeria scheduled for today .</TEXT>
