   <HEADLINE> MAN DIES , 415 MYSTERIOUSLY STRICKEN ILL ON CRUISE_SHIP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One elderly man died and 415 other passengers and crew_members of a San Pedro-based cruise_ship were reported ill Thursday with a mysterious gastrointestinal ailment that forced the Viking Serenade back to port a day early from a trip to Baja California , officials said . Investigators from the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control boarded the ship to determine the source of the illness . But an agency spokesman said it was too early to confirm suspicions of widespread food_poisoning or an infectious_disease . &quot; I got sick , really sick -- fever , terrible diarrhea , chills . People were dropping like flies . I was so weak , I couldn ' t lift my head from the bed , &quot; said Caren Blumfield , a West Hills resident who took her children on what was supposed to be a relaxing vacation before the start of school . None of her three children were stricken , she said . While at least six people remained hospitalized Thursday night , most of the others who were stricken appeared to be recovering without intensive medical assistance . Officials said the affliction seems to have largely run its course . After returning to San Pedro at 8 a.m. Thursday , nearly all 1 # 734 passengers and 612 crew_members remained on board the Bahamas-registered ship through the afternoon , awaiting clearance from health and customs officials . About 500 of the passengers , including the Blumfield family , finally left in the late afternoon and the others remained for the night , many awaiting airplane connections . Six passengers had been taken_off the white-and-blue vessel and hospitalized in Ensenada , one of the stops on what was to be a four-night journey of sightseeing , dining and shipboard gambling . One of those six , a 78-year-old man , died in the Ensenada hospital , said a spokesman for the ship ' s owner , Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd . Dr. David Luna Gonzalez , medical director of the Hospital de las Americas , identified the dead man as Clarence Bazar of Long_Beach . Even before the cruise , Bazar was very ill , suffering from heart_disease , diabetes and cancer in one of his kidneys , Gonzalez said . Bazar had seemed to be recovering from the vomiting and diarrhea when he died of a heart_attack Thursday morning , officials said . The other five passengers hospitalized in Ensenada -- three men and two women from 65 to 80 years old -- were expected to be released in a day or two , Gonzalez said . Another man , 81-year-old Robert Hoge of Riverside , was taken by ambulance from the ship to San Pedro Peninsula Hospital Thursday morning . He was listed in fair condition . . Centers_for_Disease_Control officials said they planned to obtain body tissue and samples from the deceased man to aid in the investigation . Blood , urine and stool samples were taken from many other passengers , and the agency ' s epidemiologists conducted surveys on the dining and other activities of the passengers and crew . &quot; We are trying to find_out what some people did differently from others that may have resulted in their becoming ill , &quot; said agency spokesman Tom Skinner in Atlanta . The ship ' s water_supply , refrigeration_system and food-handling equipment were inspected Thursday , but no immediate clues were discovered , officials said . The Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruises firm promised full refunds to the passengers . Depending_on cabin size and location , fares ranged from $ 599 to $ 1 # 899 a person including air fare , travel officials said . Passengers who did not require an air connection paid $ 150 less . Richard D . Fain , Royal Caribbean ' s chairman , promised cooperation in the health inquiry . Passengers ' &quot; safety and well-being has always been our first concern , and we will be working very closely with authorities to determine the cause of this outbreak , &quot; Fain said in a prepared statement . The Viking Serenade passed its most recent government sanitation inspection in February . On a scale of 100 points , it rated 89 , with a score of 86 considered passing , Skinner said . Skinner said he was aware of no past inspection failures for the ship . However , Susan Mackey , of Rancho Santa Margarita , said an identical illness struck passengers on the Viking Serenade on a March 7 cruise to Mexico , with symptoms including diarrhea , vomiting and dizziness . &quot; This cruise line knew that something was wrong , because we complained about it , &quot; she said . Such outbreaks of shipboard illness are rare , occurring one to four times a year on ships that enter American waters or ports , officials said . One veteran customs worker at the Los Angeles port said he could not recall any such dramatic incident in the past 20 years . In July , the cruise_ship Horizon out of New York was contaminated with Legionnaires ' disease bacteria , leading to the death of one man and frightening symptoms for about 30 other passengers . Investigators said sand used in water_filters was &quot; strongly implicated. &quot; bacteria . Monday morning , the Viking Serenade left San Pedro ; the first reports of illness occurred Tuesday while it was docked off Santa Catalina Island . The number of ill mounted steadily as the ship headed toward Baja California &quot; We heard 10 people were_sick . Then 20 . Then 100 . Then 400 , &quot; Caren Blumfield said . &quot; There were rumors everywhere -- that it was cholera , that we ' d all be quarantined forever. &quot; &quot; It was scary because they would n ' t let us know anything , &quot; said Melina Keith , 17 , of Irvine , who was traveling with her family . &quot; I saw a man collapse in the hallway right in front of me. &quot; &quot; All around us , people were_sick , &quot; said Melina ' s mother , Ann . &quot; We saw lots of pale people , people in wheelchairs. &quot; In all , 408 of the 1 # 734 passengers and eight of the 612 crew_members reported symptoms . That so few crew_members were ill may prove to be a vital clue . &quot; Why didn ' t more of the crew get sick ? &quot; Blumfield said . &quot; I just don ' t understand it. &quot; Many of the other passengers praised the captain and crew for keeping people calm and aiding the sick . &quot; The crew was very helpful , very nice . There was not any panic , &quot; recalled Brick Price , a Calabasas resident , who took his family on the cruise . He was mildly ill and his 8-year-old daughter recovered after she was given medication , he said . Built_in 1982 , the Viking Serenade previously was a car-and-passenger ferry called the Stardancer , company officials said . It was rebuilt and re-christened three years ago for cruises along the California coast . The 40 # 000-ton ship is 607 feet long and has 757 cabins . Among its amenities are 173 slot_machines and roulette_wheels , a swimming_pool and a library . For some passengers unaffected by the illness , the cruise was a happy experience , said Lisa Gasho of Newport Beach , who was a passenger with her boyfriend , Steve Schroder . &quot; The food was great , the beer was great , &quot; she said . &quot; We didn ' t get sick , and we had a fantastic time ! &quot;</TEXT>
