   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; TOBACCO LAB : SCIENCE AND SILENCE ; WHEN THE SMOKING WARS HEATED_UP , PHILIP MORRIS PUT VICTOR DENOBLE ' S NICOTINE EXPERIMENTS ON ICE . HIS STORY IS PART OF THE WIDER DRAMA INVOLVING THE INDUSTRY AND ITS RESEARCHERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It wasn ' t like entering the Peace Corps , but Victor DeNoble hoped to do some good when he joined the tobacco_industry . The year was 1980 and DeNoble , then a 30-year-old Ph.D. in experimental_psychology , accepted an offer to run a secret pharmacology lab for Philip Morris Inc. , maker of Marlboro and the world ' s largest cigarette manufacturer . DeNoble was to do research on nicotine ' s effects on the behavior of rats . But the ultimate goal , he said , was the development of synthetic forms of nicotine that would give smokers a buzz while avoiding the chemical ' s injurious effects on the heart . Neither a smoker nor particular fan of the tobacco_industry , DeNoble nonetheless said he was intrigued by the chance &quot; to study a very mysterious drug &quot; and make a contribution to society . There would always be millions of smokers , he believed , so it made_sense to reduce their risk of cardiovascular_disease -- which kills more smokers than lung_cancer . But , within a_few years , the tobacco wars invaded DeNoble ' s cloister at the Philip Morris research_center in Richmond , Va . Like the other U.S. tobacco giants , Philip Morris suddenly found itself facing a wave of smoker-death claims . And as it girded for legal battle , DeNoble ' s research loomed as a serious liability . DeNoble had joined an industry deeply ambivalent about such research -- and fearful of what might happen should word of it get_out . Plaintiffs ' lawyers might seize upon the work as a tacit admission that smoking was addictive and dangerous . Having disputed these contentions for decades , the industry could not afford to be caught acting as if it believed them . Philip Morris -- which declined to respond to questions about DeNoble ' s research or otherwise discuss this story -- abruptly shut the lab in April , 1984 . DeNoble was called_in , congratulated on his fine work and told to turn_in his badge . Returning to retrieve something a_few days later , DeNoble was amazed to find no sign the lab had ever existed . &quot; Everything was gone , &quot; he recalled . &quot; The cages were gone , the animals were gone , all_the data was gone . It was empty rooms. &quot; During several months of job-hunting , Philip Morris graciously carried DeNoble and fellow scientist Paul C . Mele on its payroll . But the company also muzzled them , threatening legal_action should they publish their research . A decade passed , and the episode might have been buried forever , had word not reached the House of Representatives ' health and environment subcommittee , chaired by tobacco foe Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) . When DeNoble and Mele appeared before the panel April 28 , Rep . Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) said : &quot; Americans ought to be troubled by what we are going_to learn today , which is that when the tobacco_industry does research and the results hurt them , the investigators and their data are buttoned_up tight. &quot; Then DeNoble and Mele told their story -- opening a window on an industry that painted itself into a corner and did not know how to get_out . * Despite their unstinting attacks on the evidence against smoking , cigarette makers have behaved in private as if they knew better . Internal documents produced in lawsuits and leaked from tobacco company files reveal a preoccupation with developing &quot; safe &quot; -- or at least much safer -- cigarettes . It was this quest that brought DeNoble and Mele to Philip Morris . Besides the obvious health advantages , a safer cigarette made_good business sense . After all , smokers who quit or die cease to be good customers . But what the industry would do if it found what it sought was a bit problematic . Here , tobacco company scientists and lawyers were not always on the same wavelength . Industry lawyers knew that the &quot; safe &quot; cigarette , if one could be developed , was a legal and financial minefield . What if they found one but it bombed in the marketplace ? Would health agencies or Congress , seeing safer smokes were possible , nevertheless require the companies to modify their top-selling brands ? And what of the lawsuits that threatened to engulf the industry ? As part of their successful defense , the cigarette makers had contended there was no scientific proof that smoking was dangerous and that any risks that might exist were inherent in the product and beyond their control . A &quot; safe &quot; cigarette would appear to contradict such claims . Still , internal documents show the companies busily sought the magic_bullet . During the 1960s , ' 70s , and ' 80s , they investigated various additives , catalysts and tobacco substitutes . Some of these proved superior to regular cigarettes in the standard cancer test , which involved painting the skin of mice with tars from tobacco smoke . The experimental cigarettes were euphemistically described as having reduced &quot; biological activity &quot; -- meaning they produced fewer tumors on the skin of the mice than commercial brands . Some advances were not meant to be offered to consumers , unless political or competitive pressures required them . In a 1985 memo , a Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp . vice_president said a prototype cigarette that delivered less carbon_monoxide had been kept &quot; ready . . . in the event of a marketing need for such product. &quot; But , he wrote , &quot; right now , we do not see any pressures coming from either government_agencies or consumer groups. &quot; Brown &amp; Williamson officials declined comment . Hardly any of these projects made_it to market . The rejects included &quot; Chemosol , &quot; an additive meant to reduce cancer-causing benzopyrene in cigarette smoke . Dr. Perry B . Hudson , who tried unsuccessfully to sell the industry on the product in the 1960s , said in an interview that he was beaten from the start . &quot; They couldn ' t say to the public , in_effect , ' These diseases we ' ve been lying to you about we now can help you with. ' &quot; Scientists and consultants for Liggett Group Inc. , maker of Chesterfield and other brands , poured more_than 20 years into developing a catalyst -- made of palladium and magnesium nitrate -- that purportedly destroyed cancer-causing compounds in cigarette smoke , according to testimony in a New Jersey wrongful-death case . But project TAME , as it was known inside the company , was abandoned about 1979 because of litigation fears , according to testimony by Liggett ' s former assistant research_director , James D . Mold . &quot; They felt that such a cigarette if put_on the market would seriously indict them for having sold other types of cigarettes , &quot; according to Mold , who said in a deposition that he , too , was forbidden to publish his research on the subject . A lawyer for a top industry law_firm elaborated on this theme in 1987 in a memo bemoaning the launching of &quot; Premier &quot; -- a virtually smokeless cigarette described by its manufacturer , R . J . Reynolds Tobacco Co. , as the world ' s &quot; cleanest &quot; brand . Premier -- which delivered nicotine and cigarette flavor by heating rather than burning tobacco -- could &quot; have significant effects on the tobacco_industry ' s joint defense efforts , &quot; warned the memo by William S . Ohlmeyer of Shook , Hardy &amp; Bacon , lawyers for Philip Morris and other firms . &quot; The industry position has always been that there is no alternative design for a cigarette as we know them , &quot; Ohlmeyer wrote in the leaked memo . &quot; Unfortunately , the Reynolds announcement . . . seriously undercuts this component of industry ' s defense. &quot; If Premier struck Ohlmeyer as a foolish gamble , its fate seemed to underscore the point . Smokers hated Premier , and it quickly disappeared . All that legal exposure , and the thing didn ' t even make money . * By the time Victor DeNoble arrived in Richmond , tobacco companies understood the importance of nicotine to their business . &quot; They ( Philip Morris ) clearly believed that nicotine was a psychopharmacological agent , and it was the main reason that people smoked , &quot; DeNoble said in an interview . In fact , many in the industry had known this for a very long_time . Sir Charles Ellis , scientific adviser to the board of directors of British-American Tobacco , declared : &quot; We are in a nicotine rather than a tobacco_industry , &quot; according to a 1967 document leaked from Brown &amp; Williamson and recently cited before Congress . In a colorful memo in 1972 , Philip Morris psychologist William J . Dunn Jr . -- who eight years later would be DeNoble ' s supervisor -- was equally blunt . &quot; Think_of the cigarette pack as a storage container for a day ' s supply of nicotine , &quot; Dunn wrote . &quot; Think_of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine. &quot; Apart from its habit-forming properties , however , nicotine also was a health hazard . &quot; The Cardiovascular Effects in smoke are believed to be mainly due_to nicotine and have been thoroughly explored in literature , &quot; said a 1963 memo by Philip Morris research_director Helmut Wakeham -- which , like the Dunn memo , later was introduced in court . So Philip Morris set_about developing nicotine analogues -- compounds that would have the effects on the brain of nicotine without the cardiovascular effects . DeNoble ' s role was to study nicotine ' s effects on the behavior of rats . These results would guide the testing of the analogue compounds . He recruited Mele , a behavioral pharmacologist . They found that nicotine met two hallmarks of potential addiction -- &quot; self-administration , &quot; in that rats would press levers to inject themselves with a nicotine solution , and &quot; tolerance , &quot; in that a given dose of nicotine over time had a reduced effect . The work was to remain secret even from fellow Philip Morris scientists , DeNoble said ; test animals were delivered at dawn and brought from the loading dock to the lab under cover . Still , it seemed as though &quot; the company was truly interested in investigating their product ( and ) improving it , &quot; Mele recalled in an interview . &quot; They seemed to want to know about it with a kind of no-holds-barred attitude. &quot; That changed by 1983 . Several wrongful death claims had been filed against tobacco companies , and dozens more were_on the way . Nicotine dependence was a crucial issue in these cases . Although tobacco lawyers argued that smokers had ignored warning labels and accepted the risk , plaintiffs claimed they were hooked . The U.S. surgeon_general would pronounce nicotine addictive , but that was five years away . With the litigation heating_up , DeNoble was called to Philip Morris ' New York headquarters in June , 1983 , to brief top_executives on his work . He recalled one asking , &quot; ' Why should I risk a billion-dollar industry on rats pressing levers for nicotine ? ' My comment was , ' I have no idea , ' &quot; DeNoble said . Still , one of DeNoble ' s associates told him he thought the meeting went well . On the return flight to Richmond on the corporate jet , DeNoble remembered thinking , &quot; ' Boy , these guys can really play poker , ' because I couldn ' t read the emotions of the day. &quot; Soon , however , company lawyers were prowling the lab and reviewing research notebooks . &quot; We were told the data we were generating . . . could be dangerous to the company , &quot; DeNoble said . There was talk_of killing the research or moving it outside so the company would be freer to disavow the results . One scenario had DeNoble and Mele leaving the payroll and continuing as contractors , DeNoble testified to Congress . Another involved shifting the work to a lab in Switzerland . Earlier that year , the company had approved DeNoble ' s and Mele ' s request to publish some of their data ; their paper had been accepted by the journal Psychopharmacology . But DeNoble was told in August to withdraw the article , which he did with a letter to journal Editor Herbert Barry III . &quot; The company didn ' t want their own scientists to be publishing information that would indicate that nicotine was an addictive drug ( or ) that it was harmful in any way , &quot; Barry recalled . Withdrawal of the paper coincided with the filing of the landmark Cipollone lawsuit in New Jersey on Aug . 1 , 1983 . A longtime smoker , Rose Cipollone had contracted lung_cancer . Before her death at 58 , she sued Philip Morris and two other firms whose brands she smoked . The case ultimately produced the first verdict against a tobacco company -- a $ 400 # 000 judgment against Liggett in 1988 that was overturned on appeal . Philip Morris and Lorillard Inc. were found not liable -- in part because jurors did not believe allegations that Cipollone was hooked or that the cigarette makers had deliberately concealed information about nicotine_addiction . Whether or not it might have affected the outcome , the DeNoble-Mele paper could have helped the Cipollone family ' s case . &quot; I can certainly see why they ( Philip Morris ) would be worried about having this published , &quot; Cynthia Walters , one of the Cipollone lawyers , said in a recent interview . &quot; The jury didn ' t buy addiction as_to Rose Cipollone . . . . They didn ' t believe that she couldn ' t stop smoking , so any additional information that it ( smoking ) is addictive would have been helpful. &quot; Despite withdrawal of the paper , DeNoble ' s and Mele ' s work continued , and for a while it seemed that the storm had passed . Then in early April , 1984 , DeNoble said , he was called into the office of his boss , Jim Charles , manager of biochemical research . DeNoble previously had been promoted to associate senior scientist , and when Charles began by extolling his work , DeNoble thought he was about to be promoted again . Then the bombshell : It was strictly a business decision , but the lab would be closed . In the world of scientific_research , good jobs are hard to come_by , and the first concern of DeNoble and Mele was how to make a living . Fortunately , Philip Morris paid their salaries for months until they found new jobs . Over time , however , the men grew frustrated and angry about suppression of their data . On arriving_at Philip Morris , each had signed an agreement to seek permission before disclosing their research . They knew that Philip Morris , or any company , might have a legitimate need to hold_back information about new products . But in the realm of science , publication is the key to advancement -- of knowledge and careers . And they believed Philip Morris ' veto had nothing to do with competitive needs . So DeNoble and Mele began planning ways to get their data out . In April , 1986 , they made a presentation at a meeting in St . Louis of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology . Philip Morris found_out , and a company lawyer sent a scolding letter . &quot; In the future , &quot; it said , &quot; you are expected to comply with the terms of the agreement. &quot; That August , they gave another presentation at a meeting of the American Psychological Assn . in Washington . Frank Ryan , a former colleague , was sent by Philip Morris to snap their pictures -- after which the three men went_out for supper and beers . But Philip Morris wasn ' t fooling_around . &quot; The Company cannot tolerate this type of conduct , &quot; warned a second letter from assistant general counsel Eric A . Taussig . &quot; Any further breach of your agreement will result in action being taken. &quot; Knowing they would be overwhelmed by legal bills in a fight with Philip Morris , DeNoble and Mele backed_down . They told Taussig that they had resubmitted the 1983 paper to Psychopharmacology , and that it soon would be published . Taussig told them to withdraw it , and they did . &quot; You ' ve got_to realize that I ' m looking_at a very large corporation . . . telling me that they ' re going to tie me up in court for a long_time , &quot; DeNoble said recently . &quot; I got scared , bottom line. &quot; * Years passed , and the story might never have been publicly revealed . But it came_to_light earlier this year , when the Food and Drug Administration announced it was considering regulating nicotine as a drug . Jack Henningfield , chief of clinical pharmacology for the National Institute on Drug_Abuse , belonged_to some of the same professional societies as DeNoble and had been told in 1983 about the squelching of the data . In March , when FDA Commissioner Dr. David A . Kessler mentioned a rumor that a tobacco company had done nicotine self-administration studies with rats , Henningfield recalled the incident and told Kessler about it . Kessler and Henningfield provided details to the Waxman panel in an appearance later that month . At the subcommittee ' s request , Philip Morris waived the secrecy requirement , and DeNoble and Mele agreed to appear . Their testimony helped fan the firestorm of criticism that has engulfed the industry this year . Mele , 45 , and DeNoble , 44 , have gone_on to other things . Mele is a researcher at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute in Bethesda , Md . DeNoble is a behavioral analyst in Delaware ' s Department of Mental Retardation . But for both the appearance was cathartic -- providing a sense of vindication and of closure . It proved to be &quot; a good way to let the ( scientific ) community know what was going_on at Philip Morris , without getting_on ' 60 Minutes ' or anything like that , &quot; Mele said . &quot; We weren ' t interested in being_on a soapbox and trying to make them look bad. &quot; How Smoking Kills In the 1980s , Victor DeNoble was part of a Philip Morris research project aimed at developing a nicotine substitute -- a chemical that would give smokers a jolt without subjecting them to the cardiovascular effects of nicotine . Health experts say that cardiovascular_disease not cancer -- is the No . 1 killer associated with smoking . Chart shows estimates of smoking-related deaths in the United States in 1990 . Cardiovascular Disease , including ischemic heart disease--179 # 820 ; ( 43 % ) Cancer , including lung cancer--151 # 322 ; ( 36 % ) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease , including emphysema--84 # 475 ; ( 20 % ) Other : 3 # 073 ( 1 % ) Source : Office on Smoking &amp; Health , Centers_for_Disease_Control &amp; Prevention</TEXT>
