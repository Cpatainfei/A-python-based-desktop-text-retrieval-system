   <HEADLINE> BERLUSCONI ' S GOVERNMENT MAY NOT SURVIVE THE YEAR ; ITALY : A DAY AFTER THE PRIME_MINISTER ' S INTERROGATION BY JUDGES , A COALITION PARTNER BREAKS RANKS IN PARLIAMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a heady spring of change and promise , he vaulted to power almost effortlessly , bringing new ideas , plans and promises to a country dispirited by cronyism and political corruption . Now , seven months later , Silvio Berlusconi ' s days in power seem numbered . One day after magistrates interrogated the prime_minister in a bribery case involving his Fininvest business empire -- &quot; a spectacle of injustice , &quot; he snapped -- Berlusconi ' s right-wing coalition splintered in Parliament on Wednesday as support for his leadership eroded . Today many Berlusconi allies and enemies alike arise convinced that the government that promised Italians a brighter future may_not live_out the year . &quot; The Berlusconi chapter is closed . . . . We think the government is finished , &quot; said Marco Formentini , mayor of Milan and a nominal Berlusconi ally . &quot; It ' s time to think_of a new political alliance. &quot; Formentini represents the Northern League , a populist-federalist party that had been a pillar of Berlusconi ' s coalition . On Wednesday , the League broke_with the government , voting with the opposition for formation of a special commission to oversee a reorganization of Italian broadcasting . Berlusconi ' s $ 7-billion-a-year interests include ownership of three of Italy ' s seven national television channels . League supporters exchanged shouts and abuse Wednesday on the Parliament floor with legislators of Berlusconi ' s Forza Italia and the National Alliance , its extreme-right-wing stablemate . &quot; The moment of truth is coming , &quot; said Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini . An atmosphere of political crisis hung over chilly , polluted streets around the downtown Parliament on Wednesday night as politicians maneuvered in search of a fulcrum . In the next few days , the Senate is likely to approve Berlusconi ' s austerity 1995 budget ; it must pass_by year ' s end . Once that is done , Berlusconi says he will ask_for a vote_of_confidence , a move that could bring_down his government . The 58-year-old Milan entrepreneur emerged from an eight-hour session with magistrates in Milan on Tuesday in a cold fury . The magistrates believe he may have known of about $ 205 # 000 in bribes allegedly paid by Fininvest to tax inspectors in 1990 and 1991 . &quot; There is no shred of paper or any person to affirm that I ordered any illegal acts or was aware of any in conducting my businesses , &quot; Berlusconi said . Claiming their inquiries are politically motivated , the government is dueling with judges who have led a corruption probe that has ensnared more_than 3 # 000 business_leaders , public officials and politicians . &quot; Against me and my government there is a plot whose vastness and intensity could be compared to a coup d ' etat , &quot; Berlusconi complained after meeting the judges . Conspirators , he said , &quot; want a crisis , and they are working so that things go badly with the sole purpose of getting_rid_of me. &quot;</TEXT>
