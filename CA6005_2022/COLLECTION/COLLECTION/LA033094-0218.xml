   <HEADLINE> PASSION FOR MOVIES UNITED SLAIN FRIENDS ; TRAGEDY : STUDENTS KILLED IN CARJACKING LIVED AND BREATHED FILMS . A SHRINE RISES IN THE PARKING LOT WHERE THEY DIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To Ralphs assistant manager Ric Gibbs , the two were simply &quot; the film guys. &quot; Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura constantly talked movies when they stopped at the San Pedro supermarket late at night to buy soda or toothpaste . Then the two 19-year-old Marymount College_students were gunned_down Friday night outside Ralphs and were transformed into international martyrs of violent crime in Los Angeles . Now their stunned friends are filing through the supermarket to buy candles for the impromptu memorial garden of daisy bouquets , Easter_lilies and potted chrysanthemums that has sprung_up on the pavement outside . &quot; They bought almost all_the candles we had , &quot; said Gibbs , who gave one of the friends $ 10 to buy more candles for the parking_lot shrine . Speakers remembered the two students in English and Japanese at a private memorial service Tuesday in the Marymount chapel that drew between 200 and 250 people , including the young_men ' s families , students , faculty and staff , a college official said . As the students ' photos flash on television screens around the world , those who knew Ito and Matsuura say they are struggling with the loss of two young_men that they describe -- not as international figures -- but as good-humored , talented young_men . &quot; These are two students who were unusually directed , &quot; said their faculty adviser , Pat Kelley . &quot; When the ( film ) class ended , they wanted to take the videotape home and watch it again. &quot; The two frequented a Blockbuster video store near Ralphs and combed Los Angeles in search of new films . For a recent class assignment , Ito wrote an essay explaining that he needed a girlfriend because he wanted someone to watch movies with . Their writing teacher , assistant_professor Sandra Ross , recalled how the two , who both favored baseball_caps , would stop by her office to report on films they had seen that weekend . Their favorite actresses were Jodie Foster and Geena Davis , but their biggest hero was director Steven Spielberg , and they applauded the accolades heaped on &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; at the recent Academy Awards . Friends and teachers say the two loved being in the United States . When Ito ' s grandfather died several weeks ago , Ito traveled back to Japan and recorded his impressions of the transpacific journey in an essay that Kelley read from this week . After arriving in Japan , he wrote : &quot; When I had Japanese soup , my body absorbs it like dry sands . I found that I am really Japanese at that time. &quot; Ito also described wanting to eat hamburgers &quot; like American people. &quot; He added : &quot; Though my home country is Japan , I wanted to go_back to the U.S.A. like a refugee. &quot; Now , in Japan , his death is the subject of newspaper editorials . One remarked : &quot; Among the world ' s advanced nations , there is no country except the United States in which it is so easy to obtain firearms . Viewed from the outside , America ' s gun society can be seen only as abnormal . We want Americans to more seriously face that fact. &quot; At the flower shrine outside Ralphs , someone has added a simple , handwritten sign : &quot; We must have gun_control . Who is next ? Your child ? &quot;</TEXT>
