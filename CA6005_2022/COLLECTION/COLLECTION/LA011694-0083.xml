   <HEADLINE> BEST OF BERLIN FOR YOUNG TRAVELERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the Berlin Wall fell_in early November , 1989 , Berlin ' s east and west sections were rejoined to create the third-largest city in Europe , with a population of about 3.4 million . It ' s a city whose history attracts curious travelers , but it ' s also a city struggling with tremendous changes . To make visits easier for independent budget travelers , there ' s a free 160-page booklet called &quot; Berlin for Young People. &quot; Due_to its decades of division , Berlin has two of almost everything . There are two zoos , two main opera_houses , two clusters of major museums , two commercial centers and two theater districts . There are also three international airports and five railway_stations . The unified Berlin actually has more museums than either London or Paris . The city also boasts KaDeWe , Europe ' s largest department_store ; a zoological_garden ( Zoologischer Garten ) with one of the largest zoos in the world , housing 11 # 000 animals of nearly 1 # 600 species , plus a three-story aquarium , and one of the most abundant botanic gardens ( Botanischer Garten ) in Europe . &quot; Berlin for Young People &quot; is designed to help travelers quickly find their way around the city , while getting more_than just a superficial impression . It covers transportation options , budget accommodation suggestions , do-it-yourself tours , sightseeing attractions , entertainment , dining , shopping , open-air_markets and emergency services . This publication is designed to help travelers enjoy the city without paying prime prices . For example , the guide advises that many major theaters will sell reduced-price tickets to students with identification one-half hour before show time ( assuming tickets are still available ) . The guide provides maps and route suggestions for tours by foot or by public bus , ranging from one to five hours . You ' ll even find suggestions on which buildings offer good panoramic views . For example , Television Tower , a focal_point of the former East Berlin , has a viewing platform and cafe near the 600-foot level . Some suggested sights include Checkpoint Charlie , where there ' s a permanent exhibit on the Berlin Wall ; Charlottenburg Palace , the former residence of the Prussian royalty , which now houses a number of museums ; Kurfurstendamm , the city ' s main boulevard that is lined with cafes , boutiques and prestigious stores , and the Brandenburg Gate , which today is a symbol of German unity . The booklet does carry this warning : &quot; Colorful and exciting though Berlin night life may be , it does no harm to be a little watchful in the nocturnal jungle of the big city . Along with the many creative aspects , there are also the darker sides of a metropolis : the drug scene and violence . It ' s better simply to avoid areas , pubs , clubs and other places where you don ' t feel quite at ease. &quot; When you ' re ready to leave Berlin , the guide lists Mitfahrzentralen , or ride centers , that can help arrange transportation to other cities in cars driven by private citizens . It ' s a form of car-pooling that links passengers with drivers . You share fuel costs with the driver and pay a fee . It ' s cheaper than traveling_by bus , and gives visitors a chance to get_to know residents . For copies of &quot; Berlin for Young People &quot; ( available in English or French ) , inquire at Berlin Tourist Information offices . You can find them at the Europa Center ( ground_floor , entrance on Budapester Strasse ) ; at the Alexanderplatz TV Tower and at the Bahnhof Zoo Railway_Station . All offices are open daily . For other helpful publications and general information on travel_to Germany , contact the German National Tourist Office , 11766 Wilshire Blvd. , Suite 750 , Los Angeles 90025 ; telephone ( 310 ) 575-9799 .</TEXT>
