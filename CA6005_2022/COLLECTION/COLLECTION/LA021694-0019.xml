   <HEADLINE> VIETNAM TRADE_EMBARGO ENDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * In response to &quot; Wrong Time , Wrong Man to Lift the Embargo , &quot; by Susan Carpenter McMillan , Column Right , Feb . 8 , about POW / MIAs : McMillan included a quote by me about my father , Maj . Albro L . Lundy Jr. , POW / MIA , Laos , Dec . 24 , 1970 . Unfortunately a typographical_error made the last paragraph , which was clearly the author ' s opinion , appear to be my words . I wish to correct the record and state my personal opinion . Whatever other motives President Clinton had in lifting the trade_embargo against Vietnam , his actions prove that he held commercial and political interests above those of the servicemen and their families , contrary to his publicly stated position . His hollow reasoning that trading with Vietnam would further the POW / MIA cause is belied by the fact that at least 80 men were left as last known alive in Vietnam , according to Henry Kissinger , as well as another 350 in Laos , according to Lawrence Eagleburger . The Vietnamese now , and in the past , refuse to return or even account_for these men . At the very least , these men last known alive should have been returned , or had their cases credibly resolved prior to lifting the embargo . The POW / MIA situation is a microcosm of the war in Vietnam -- which was a lie from beginning to end . The conflict , fueled by corporate interests , was the external manifestation of the corruption that evolves in and revolves_around Washington to this day . ALBRO L . LUNDY III Beverly Hills * How many American soldiers turned_up missing out of how many who served combat duty in the American_Revolution , the War of 1812 , the Civil War ? How many actually served abroad in Cuba , the Philippines and France ( two wars ) and how many are still missing ? Of our younger family members , two went_to Vietnam . One ( his father was shot down and killed over Korea after flying in World_War_II ) came_back unwounded ; we went_to a West_Point funeral for the other . Clinton was ( is ) correct that we never should have gotten suckered into fighting for French interests , even after France had given_up . McMillan has so bludgeoned and belabored the point that I am now about to declare peace . JOHN D . ANDREWS Palos Verdes Peninsula * Hurrah for McMillan ' s column . First with NATO and now with lifting the embargo on Vietnam , President Clinton is clearly showing us what kind of a New Democrat he is . One that big business has securely in its back pockets . LARRY McDONOHUE Chino * McMillan ' s column criticizing President Clinton ' s lifting the embargo against Vietnam uses two very tired and fallacious arguments . One , Clinton is a draft_dodger . Excuse me , but didn ' t he use the rules made by the White_House and Congress at the time ? Those rules were available to everyone , and he didn ' t make them . Two , Clinton demonstrated on foreign soil against his country . Does McMillan mean that our constitutional rights end at our borders ? Whether you agree with Clinton ' s anti-Vietnam War position or not , we all have a constitutional right to address our government . CHARLES FERGUSON Mission Viejo * I applaud President Clinton ' s normalization of trade with Vietnam . Certainly as an American presence in that country develops we should have a far better chance of ascertaining the status of the remaining POW / MIAs . And certainly if they develop a trade dependency on us , we can monitor and mitigate civil_rights violations in Vietnam . I do wonder if it means it is necessary for a country to have to fight us to get normal trade relations -- what about Burma and Cambodia ? ROBERT M . CROWDER Laguna Beach * As the daughter of a man who died in Vietnam in 1971 , and as a member of the national organization , Sons and Daughters in Touch , I was surprised to hear of the return of 12 sets of remains four days after the U.S.-Vietnam trade_embargo was lifted ( Feb . 8 ) . I applaud the healing motion of lifting the embargo . I feel that because the media made so little of the return of the remains , another opportunity for the healing of this nation ' s sorrow over Vietnam was lost . Let ' s please give any subsequent homecomings the respect and media attention those heroes deserve . After all , even Achilles showed respect for Hector by eating a ceremonial burial feast with Priam , Hector ' s mourning father . STACY TUMLIN Temecula</TEXT>
