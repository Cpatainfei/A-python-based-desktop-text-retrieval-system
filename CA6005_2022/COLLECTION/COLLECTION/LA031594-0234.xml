   <HEADLINE> HUBBELL QUITS ; TOP JUSTICE AIDE , CLINTON FRIEND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Webster Hubbell , the third-ranking Justice_Department official and a close friend of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton , resigned Monday amid allegations that he cost his former Little_Rock law_firm as much as $ 1 million in unbilled time and questionable expenses . Hubbell said in a statement that an investigation into his billing practices by his former partners at Little_Rock ' s Rose Law_Firm had become a burdensome distraction and that he did not want to do further damage to the Administration by remaining in office . The departure of Hubbell leaves a gaping hole at Justice , which has not yet filled the spot vacated by the departure last month of the department ' s second-ranking official , Deputy Atty . Gen . Philip B . Heymann , who quit in a personality clash with Atty . Gen . Janet Reno . The Hubbell resignation also intensifies the growing cost to the Clintons of the Whitewater controversy , and it leaves an impression of an Administration in disarray . &quot; It could not have come at a worse time for him and for the Administration , &quot; said a senior White_House adviser . Hubbell described the_matters under dispute with his former firm as &quot; private issues &quot; relating to &quot; compensation and reimbursement &quot; that have nothing to do with Whitewater or the President and First_Lady . &quot; I am confident that at the conclusion of these discussions all outstanding matters will be resolved satisfactorily , &quot; Hubbell said . The Rose firm internal investigation &quot; came_to a very acute head &quot; over the last several days , according to knowledgeable sources . Hubbell ' s former partners confronted him with how much money they believed he owed them and said that they could not settle the_matter amicably , the sources said . Hubbell decided Sunday to resign , knowing that the dispute with Rose would spill_over into the public arena , embarrass the Clintons and limit his effectiveness at Justice , a senior White_House official said . &quot; He did the honorable thing , &quot; the aide said . &quot; He didn ' t want to ensnare the President and the First Lady. &quot; Numerous calls to attorneys at the Rose firm went unanswered Monday . The firm ' s outside counsel , Walter B . Stuart of the Houston firm , Vinson &amp; Elkins , did not return calls seeking comment . Hubbell , Mrs . Clinton and the late Deputy White_House Counsel Vincent Foster , who apparently committed suicide last July , all were senior partners and close friends at Rose before coming_to Washington with Clinton ' s inauguration . Hubbell ' s resignation followed the forced resignation of White_House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum on March 5 . Nussbaum quit after disclosures that he had met with federal regulators looking_into the Clintons ' role in the Whitewater case . Nussbaum , too , was a close friend of the First_Lady ' s , having worked with her 20 years ago on the House Judiciary Committee considering the impeachment of former President Richard Nixon . Special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . is looking_into allegations that the President may have benefited improperly from his association with James B . McDougal , owner of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan and partner with the Clintons in an Ozark real_estate development firm known as Whitewater Development Corp . The inquiry also encompasses the role played by Mrs . Clinton and her firm in representing Whitewater and Madison Guaranty . In his letter of resignation to the President , Hubbell wrote that dealing with &quot; public speculation about me and my former law_firm &quot; would consume increasing amounts of his time and would limit his effectiveness in office . Arriving in Boston for a political appearance , Clinton told reporters that Hubbell made &quot; the right decision. &quot; And while he praised Hubbell as a &quot; good personal friend &quot; and a lawyer who is &quot; widely esteemed &quot; by those who know him , Clinton appeared to leave himself considerable maneuvering room in case the facts prove otherwise . &quot; I haven ' t talked to him since this whole issue came_up , &quot; Clinton said . He repeated several times that he had &quot; no knowledge of the facts. &quot; Hubbell &quot; strongly feels that he will be vindicated but it will take some time for him to do_it and that he shouldn ' t be working_at a public job while he ' s doing that , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; I think he ' s right. &quot; The Rose firm has been investigating Hubbell ' s billing practices since last year , when it discovered what it considered discrepancies in the hourly billings and expense_accounts of the former senior partner . The internal review heated_up last month when the monetary scale of the dispute became clear and when Fiske announced that he would investigate a broad range of activities at the Rose firm when Hubbell , Foster and Mrs . Clinton were essentially in_charge . The matters under scrutiny internally at Rose involved the business interests of Hubbell ' s father-in-law and brother-in-law , Seth Ward Sr . and Seth Ward Jr. , as well as Hubbell ' s work for federal bank regulatory_agencies , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and the Resolution Trust Corp . The firm is trying to determine whether Hubbell properly accounted_for personal_expenses paid_out of firm funds and whether there was any impropriety involved in litigation costs borne by the firm in matters Hubbell handled . Hubbell took_on an unsuccessful copyright infringement suit that a parking meter manufacturing company owned by the Wards filed against a competitor , according to White_House and Justice_Department sources . Hubbell assumed the case on a contingency basis , an unusual arrangement for a large corporate law_firm , meaning that if he lost the case his firm would bear the expenses of the litigation . Hubbell lost the case but did not reveal the contingency fee deal to his partners until after he joined the Administration , the sources said . As a result , Rose will get none of the $ 500 # 000 it would have received from the Wards if it had been able to bill on an hourly basis . What ' s more , the firm was stuck_with as much as $ 500 # 000 in additional costs related to the case , including fees paid to expert witnesses , outside copyright specialists , travel , copying and various other expenses generated during what was a major lawsuit , the sources said . Also , the RTC is conducting a full-scale audit of more_than $ 1.2 million billed to the agency by the Rose firm since 1989 to see whether the charges were justified . Hubbell solicited the regulatory business and supervised many of the 22 bank cases handled by the firm , including one against the former auditors of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan . &quot; After a thoughtful weekend , I believe that my continued service will not be as effective as it has been ; that the distractions on me at this time will interfere with my service to the country and the President ' s agenda ; and that my family , although totally supportive , is being harmed , &quot; Hubbell said in a statement released by the Justice_Department . Hubbell and his wife , Suzanna , have four children ranging_in age from 12 to 21 . &quot; It is also unfortunate that private issues between me and my firm have been cast , by some , as being part of a broad political net called Whitewater , &quot; he added . &quot; These private issues have nothing to do with Whitewater , Madison Guaranty , the McDougals or the President and First Lady. &quot; Hubbell ' s dispute with Rose is only tangentially related to Whitewater , a Justice_Department official contended , though it was Whitewater and the presence of reporters looking_into it in Little_Rock that prompted dissidents at the law_firm to make their move against their former colleague , according to a source close to Hubbell . &quot; In the current climate , some members of the firm reached back to prior cases and in the course of that there were some isolated matters involving the Resolution Trust Corp . that they queried Webb about , &quot; the source said . &quot; Even though the dispute has nothing to do with Whitewater , it ' s Whitewater that created the climate , that gave the dissidents in the firm the opportunity to go_after Hubbell , and preoccupation with Whitewater increases the pressure on Hubbell to get this dispute off the government ' s back , &quot; a source close to Hubbell said . Another source said that Hubbell had asked the firm to conciliate the_matter , but the firm refused . Hubbell was the first Clinton_Administration official to join the Justice_Department at the very beginning of Clinton ' s term and ran the department for weeks while the White_House stumbled through the process of naming an attorney_general . Hubbell had broad responsibilities as the No . 3 official . He oversaw the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Civil Rights , Environment and Natural_Resources , Civil , Antitrust and Tax divisions . He also was responsible_for the Office of Legislative Affairs , the Bureau of Prisons , the Community Relations Service and the Office of Legal Counsel , which serves as the attorney_general ' s legal adviser . The official said that Hubbell met Sunday with friends , including Mickey Kantor , who is U.S. trade representative , to review the dispute and what to do about it . Hubbell apparently decided after Sunday ' s session to quit but wanted to keep at arm ' s length from the President and First_Lady . Kantor on Sunday informed White_House Chief_of_Staff Thomas ( Mack ) McLarty , who told the President of Hubbell ' s impending action . Hubbell called Mrs . Clinton on Monday to tell her of his decision , aides said . In Denver , Mrs . Clinton said of Hubbell : &quot; Personally , as a friend , I am thinking a lot about him and his family and wishing him well. &quot; In a brief press appearance in mid-afternoon to announce Hubbell ' s resignation , Reno said : &quot; There are no words capable of fully conveying to you my deep respect and admiration for Webb Hubbell or how sad this event makes me . He has been a tireless crusader for doing_justice , for doing the right thing. &quot; There is no list of potential replacements for Hubbell , a Justice_Department official said , noting that Hubbell could remain on_the_job for as long as 30 days . Times staff writers Robert L . Jackson and David Lauter in Washington and special correspondent Kristina Lindgren in Denver contributed to this story .</TEXT>
