   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; ANTELOPE VALLEY FAIR MAKING CHANGES AFTER CRITICAL AUDIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Antelope Valley Fair is making dozens of changes in its operations in the wake of a scathing state audit that made nearly 200 recommendations necessary to bring the fair into compliance with state regulations . Fair officials on Thursday released an 18-page audit response , which details the changes that will be made as a result of the audit released in November . Fair Manager Bruce Latta said the fair is required &quot; to show this plan has been implemented &quot; in six months . Many of the changes , according to the response , were implemented even before the audit was released . More have been made since and some are left to be done_in coming months . &quot; We have a little more work to do , &quot; said Latta , who was hired as fair manager less than a year ago . &quot; Six months from now I ' ll feel a little better. &quot; While no criminal violations were found , auditors with the state_Department of Food and Agriculture made nearly four times the usual number of recommendations compared to audits of other state fairs . In addition , auditors said many of their findings were &quot; significant. &quot; The audit covered a two-year period beginning Jan . 1 , 1991 , and found violations ranging from the use of state funds to buy alcohol to the employment of temporary_workers for more days than state law permits in a year . Numerous problems found during the audit had been identified in previous audits but never corrected , Agriculture_Department officials said . This time , however , they said they are confident the violations will cease . Fair Board President Charla Abbott said the audit has been a learning experience . The nine board_members , some who have served for more_than two decades , are more familiar than ever with state fair regulations as a result of the audit , she said .</TEXT>
