   <HEADLINE> EDUCATION : ETHNIC IMMERSION PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although Farragut Elementary School ' s Japanese immersion program is laudable for its goals and its unique enriching experience ( &quot; The Global Classroom , &quot; Feb . 27 ) , there are some education issues which should be examined . Firstly , with California ' s disgraceful school funding record , the disparity between resources allocated to non-immersion and immersion classrooms is obvious ( e.g. , lower student-teacher ratios and use of classroom aides ) .Secondly , and with perhaps more serious consequences for the future , immersion classrooms may encourage a trend toward segregating schoolchildren by ethnic_group . ( Families of Japanese descent naturally find the Japanese immersion program attractive. ) The Culver City Board_of_Education ' s recent decision to relocate both the Spanish and Japanese immersion programs to a separate facility will effectively isolate these kids . Why not Ukrainian , Hebrew and Korean immersion programs ? Because , in the end , we will have negated one of public education ' s strongest assets -- the sharing of common experience by our richly diverse community of children .
