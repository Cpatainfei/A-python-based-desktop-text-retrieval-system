   <HEADLINE> KANTOR , CITING UNSETTLED JAPAN POLITICS , PUTS OFF TRADE RULING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor postponed a ruling Thursday on a critical U.S.-Japanese trade dispute , citing the unsettled Japanese political situation following the selection Wednesday of a new government . Kantor announced he would put_off for up_to 30 days a decision on allegedly discriminatory Japanese government procurement practices for medical products and telecommunications_equipment . Such a decision could begin a process that might end with the United States imposing trade sanctions . Kantor also said a delay was acceptable because trade negotiators have made steady progress toward resolving the dispute . The delay marked the first tangible fallout from a government shuffle that is expected to sharply slow the progress of U.S.-Japanese trade talks and greatly reduce the chances that any important bilateral decisions are reached at next week ' s meeting of top industrial nations in Naples , Italy . The Clinton_Administration has heavily stressed those trade efforts , and officials had hoped to produce visible results before the summit began . Separately , Kantor said the United States would immediately begin an investigation of allegations that the Chinese have not properly protected U.S. patents and copyrights in their country . The announcement means China could face sanctions if the two countries do not resolve the disagreement in the next few months . Kantor has said that he would not allow instability in Japan -- now on its fourth government in a year -- to put_off trade actions . But , he said , &quot; I am a realist . I understand what the situation is , and the possibilities of whether or not we are going_to reach a conclusion that is satisfactory to the United States. &quot; The new coalition government , led by Tomiichi Murayama , is considered highly unstable . Many analysts in Japan and elsewhere predict it may dissolve quickly . Even so , U.S. officials publicly asserted that they intend to try to forge ahead on the outstanding U.S.-Japanese issues at the Naples summit with a meeting between Clinton and Murayama . Anthony Lake , Clinton ' s national security adviser , said the meeting &quot; obviously will be a get-acquainted session . But I would expect . . . that there will be discussion of important bilateral issues. &quot; The topics will include the broad framework of U.S.-Japanese trade and &quot; a very serious discussion of North Korea. &quot;</TEXT>
