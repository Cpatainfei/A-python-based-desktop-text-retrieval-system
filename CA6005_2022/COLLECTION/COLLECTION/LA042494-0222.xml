   <HEADLINE> CLINTONOMICS UNDONE ; THE ' INVESTMENT ' CANDIDATE PROVES A DEFICIT HAWK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was chilled and overcast as the borrowed corporate jet , inbound from Washington , sliced_through the cloud_cover into the Little_Rock , Ark. , airport early on the morning of Jan . 7 , 1993 . Robert Rubin , a wealthy Wall_Street financier and one of President-elect Bill_Clinton ' s closest confidants , had arranged for the plane so they could all fly down together : Rubin , Lloyd Bentsen , Leon Panetta , Ira Magaziner , Roger Altman , Alice Rivlin and perhaps half_a_dozen others . Tumbling onto the Tarmac came most of the Clinton brain trust , an eclectic group of millionaires , academics , consultants and career politicians , men and women with almost nothing in common save their ambition to serve in the first Democratic Administration in 12 years . Rubin saw his main task as the &quot; honest broker , &quot; the coach who would make_sure everyone felt part of a team . And it was arguably the most important team in the country -- the economic_policy players of a new President who had just won the White_House at the end of the longest economic slowdown since World_War_II , a President elected on a promise of jobs , growth and fundamental economic change . Yet already , petty feuds and policy differences had turned erstwhile allies into rivals . Magaziner and Bob Reich , for example , had co-authored a book and worked side_by_side through the long ordeal of 1992 . Now , before Clinton could even take the oath of office , they had engaged in a bloody battle for position in the new Administration . Their camaraderie had soured into mutual contempt . Others -- Bentsen and Panetta among them -- were newcomers brought_in during the presidential transition to add credibility or diversity to the new government . Yet they cared little what Clinton might have said on the stump in Atlanta or Los Angeles the previous autumn . Indeed , Panetta , one of the leading deficit hawks in Congress , publicly criticized Clinton ' s economic program in the midst of the campaign while privately warning Clinton that the numbers behind his campaign ' s economic plan didn ' t square . Rivlin , regarded_as the most knowledgeable budget analyst on the team , was already irritating campaign veterans with her single-minded focus_on the deficit . Still , Clinton needed -- and wanted -- these newcomers . They gave him gravitas and spelled stability to Wall_Street , which was still skittish over the recent transfer of power in Washington . The bond market in particular was worried that Clinton would inflate the deficit with his promised new spending programs . So , in his key appointments on economic_policy -- the heart and soul of the new Administration -- Clinton was turning_to America ' s financial and political elites , just as John F . Kennedy , his role_model , had done more_than 30 years before . In Rubin , for example , Clinton would have his own Douglas Dillon , the Republican Treasury_secretary whom Kennedy recruited from Wall_Street . By early January , a quiet coup was in_progress . With Clinton ' s approval , the newcomers were taking_charge , gradually distancing the President-elect from the rhetoric and ideas of his campaign . And by the time Clinton settled into the White_House , a stunning transformation would occur . A buoyant campaign agenda emphasizing expanded federal &quot; investment &quot; in infrastructure , technology and people would become a dour prescription stressing deficit reduction above all else . A promised tax cut for middle Americans would be jettisoned in favor of tax_hikes hitting squarely at the suburban classes . To a considerable degree , the first liberal Democratic President in 12 years would be leaving the fate of his presidency in the hands of Wall_Street ' s most conservative and skittish creatures : bond traders . That was fine for the White_House in 1993 , when rates were steadily declining . But by February , 1994 , when the Federal_Reserve_Board began raising rates and the stock_market fell_off the cliff , Clinton would find himself strapped into a deficit-reduction straitjacket . And , like George_Bush before him , he could do little but watch from the sidelines as economic_policy moved against him . Still , in early 1993 , all that was in the future . That January , almost as if by some mysterious alchemy , Bill_Clinton was changing into a completely different -- and far more conservative , tradition-bound -- politician than the one who had been elected the previous November . Over time , the new President and his defenders would acknowledge the sea change in his economic plan . But they would publicly blame it on circumstances beyond their control . They would insist that the federal_deficit turned_out to be even bigger and more frightening than anyone had imagined ; they argued that officials in the Bush White_House had hidden the extent of the problem until the last_days before Clinton ' s inauguration . And when Clinton and his team realized just how bad the deficit really was , they were forced to rethink their priorities . But extensive interviews with top Administration officials , including virtually all_of the President ' s key economic advisers , reveal that this rationalization was largely disingenuous . For months before the election , Clinton and his closest aides knew that the budget numbers in his campaign agenda didn ' t add_up and that candidate Clinton had promised far more_than he would be able to deliver . They also knew by the summer of 1992 that the deficit was much worse than was assumed in their campaign documents . But they refused to change the obsolete arithmetic on which Clinton ' s campaign economic plan was based , for fear of attracting negative press coverage and attacks from the Bush campaign . What ' s more , Clinton ' s closest confidants also recognized that in his heart of hearts , Clinton was much more of a deficit hawk than the media or the American electorate ever would have guessed . So a sharp reversal from Clinton ' s campaign agenda was inevitable all along . Indeed , senior Administration officials , including Bentsen and Panetta , concede that the professed shock at higher deficit estimates issued after the election was largely feigned . Moreover , the new Clinton team issued initial budget projections soon after taking_office that put absolutely the worst face possible on the deficit outlook , manipulating data to reinforce the impression that Bush had left Clinton with a fiscal nightmare . The expressions of outrage were designed in part to provide political cover_for the policy coup that was already well under way . At 10 a.m. on Jan . 7 , as movers down the hall packed up the President-elect ' s belongings , Rubin and his entourage filed into the dining_room of the Arkansas governor ' s mansion . They sat_down around the long dining_table for a meeting with Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore . The session continued until 5 p.m. It was the first meeting of Rubin ' s National Economic Council , a new Cabinet-level organization that would come_to hold_sway over most domestic and international issues requiring presidential attention . In hindsight , many of the participants now concur , that marathon meeting and a lengthy follow-up session a week later were two of the most critical events of the first year of the Clinton presidency . During those sessions , Clinton took the final step away from his campaign ' s economic agenda . Out of five deficit-reduction paths presented as options during the Jan . 7 meeting , Clinton chose the most aggressive . It called_for cutting the deficit to roughly $ 205 billion by fiscal 1997 , the final year of his first term . That meant slicing $ 140 billion from that year ' s projected shortfall as part of a multiyear deficit reduction package that would lock Clinton into set levels of spending throughout that term . As every budget analyst knew -- and as_many told Clinton the previous year -- the only way to make a dent in the deficit would be to take money from the middle_class , something he had sworn not to do during the campaign . So Clinton ' s $ 60-billion tax cut for the middle_class would finally have to be killed . In its place , the Clinton team would propose a startling substitute : a $ 71.5-billion energy tax that would land squarely on middle-class Americans . There would be other unpopular revenue items : a $ 29-billion proposal to tax Social_Security benefits received by more affluent retirees and a Reaganesque plan to freeze cost-of-living adjustments for Social_Security benefits and other entitlement programs . Meanwhile , Clinton ' s investment agenda would be scaled back , leaving some aides bitterly disappointed . During the campaign , Magaziner pushed for $ 50 billion a year in new &quot; investment spending. &quot; Instead of these more ambitious plans , Clinton would propose a $ 16-billion short-term stimulus plan , along with a five-year investment program starting at roughly $ 20 billion a year . Most analysts agreed that the economic effects would be so small that they would be drowned_out by the new_wave of deficit reduction . With its reliance on higher taxes to cut the deficit , Clintonomics was beginning to look a lot like Bushonomics . Alan Blinder was surprised just to be in the dining_room with the rest of the Rubin group . A shy yet highly regarded Princeton economist who often commuted across campus by bicycle , he had been an occasional adviser to the Clinton campaign . But as the calls from Little_Rock became less frequent in the fall of 1992 , he felt certain he would be passed_over for a top-level Administration job . He was right . Clinton turned_to Blinder ' s old friend and former classmate , Berkeley economist Laura D ' Andrea Tyson , to become the first woman to chair the White_House Council of Economic Advisers . But Tyson , aware of her lack of experience in macroeconomic forecasting and analysis , asked Blinder to come and work with her . Blinder buried what few feelings of resentment he felt and became Tyson ' s No . 2 on the council . So it fell to Blinder , perhaps the least political person present during the January sessions , to underscore for Clinton the potential impact -- and political risks -- of his new focus_on deficit reduction . While campaign consultants Paul Begala and James Carville worried openly about the immediate political effect of broken promises , Blinder and Tyson feared the new strategy could threaten the fragile recovery , making_it more difficult for Clinton to generate new jobs . &quot; The worst-case scenario of the policies we ' re now considering , &quot; Blinder told the President-elect , &quot; is a George Bush-style recession. &quot; It was a clear enough warning for a politician who had just beaten Bush with a campaign rallying cry of &quot; It ' s the economy , stupid. &quot; Recalls Blinder matter-of-factly : &quot; I think my statement caught his attention. &quot; With his new agenda , Blinder warned Clinton , the only hope for economic_growth would come from a potential beneficial impact on long-term interest_rates . As the deficit fell_under Clinton ' s plan , the government ' s borrowing demands should fall as well . So should long-term interest_rates . Indeed , &quot; long rates &quot; had remained stubbornly high despite record-low short-term interest_rates ; economists called the phenomenon a &quot; steep yield curve , &quot; reflecting the fact that many financiers weren ' t convinced that inflation was really whipped . If the financial markets became convinced that federal borrowing demands would be permanently reduced , the yield curve could flatten . Interest_rates on many loans and mortgages would subside , motivating consumers to buy more houses and cars . Rates on bonds would drop , prompting companies to borrow funds to invest in new plants and hire more workers . Under this scenario , a reduction in federal spending could , ironically , cause an expansion in the overall economy . Rubin and Altman , both fresh from Wall_Street , were convinced that the markets were ripe for just such a chain of events . They persuaded Clinton to embrace their argument that aggressive deficit reduction would lead to faster economic_growth . But academics Tyson and Blinder cautioned that this was all untested theory . Clinton would be counting_on lower interest_rates to accelerate the economy before the reduction in federal spending could slow things down . No administration had ever accomplished anything quite like it . Blinder and Tyson agreed with Rubin and Altman that deficit reduction would be the proper long-term policy . But they didn ' t want Clinton to be sold on the idea that it could guarantee quick economic_growth . The evidence was spotty on whether the Rubin-Altman formula would benefit a President facing a four-year election cycle . True , the economic drag should prove temporary , while the benefits would be permanent and ultimately much larger . Over 20 years , Blinder said , the deficit reduction program could increase annual economic_growth by 1.1 % to 2.2 % per year . But the costs were likely to outweigh the benefits for at least five years . Frustrated , Clinton wanted better answers , better forecasts . Tyson said accurate economic models for measuring the effects of deficit reduction on interest_rates didn ' t exist . Blinder warned Clinton that if he embarked_on a regimen of stiff deficit reduction and budget restraint , he could be held hostage to the whims of the financial markets -- and the Federal_Reserve_Board . Clinton had already met with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , but he had received no assurances of accommodation . Altman had met privately with some Fed officials who indicated they thought the size of the deficit package Clinton was considering was appropriate . There were no promises of additional interest_rate reductions , though ; the Fed had lowered short-term rates by four percentage_points since the beginning of the Bush recession in mid-1990 , and the central_bank ' s inflation hawks feared any further cuts could prove combustible . So Clinton ' s multiyear deficit reduction plan would limit his flexibility on economic_policy , Blinder warned , potentially placing the fate of his presidency in Greenspan ' s hands . The same fate had befallen Bush after he agreed to a 1990 deficit-reduction pact in which he too had broken a key campaign promise on taxes . &quot; We really should get some kind of understanding with the Federal_Reserve , &quot; Blinder told the President-elect . When Greenspan sat next to First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton during her husband ' s State of the Union address in February , many Fed watchers suspected that he had reached just such a detente with the President . The central_bank ' s passivity for the remainder of the year also led observers to believe that Greenspan tacitly endorsed Clinton ' s deficit-reduction plan . But that perception was shattered at the start of Clinton ' s second year in office . Last Feb . 4 , the Fed raised interest_rates for the first time in five years ; it raised them again on March 22 -- and again last Monday . Now , with analysts predicting the Fed will continue to boost short-term rates steadily throughout the year , Clinton can only hope to influence it by putting some of his people on the central_bank ' s seven-member board of governors . On Friday , the President made his move . His nominees : UC Berkeley ' s Janet Yellin , regarded_as more concerned with unemployment than inflation , and Alan Blinder . If confirmed as Fed vice_chairman , Blinder will become the odds-on favorite to succeed Greenspan when the chairman ' s term expires in March , 1996 . Betting the House on Bonds In his election campaign , Bill_Clinton talked_about major investments in job creation and training , infrastructure and technology -- a platform that frightened the financial markets but won him the presidency . Once in office , Clinton set_out to win the confidence of the bond market , in particular , committing his government to lowering the federal budget_deficit . The theory : Less federal spending and borrowing would lead to lower long-term interest_rates , buoying consumer spending and business investment . It worked -- only too well , in the eyes of the Federal_Reserve_Board . Yields on 30-year Treasury_bonds and rates on 30-year mortgages fell steadily until the robust recovery began making bond investors and the Fed nervous . The question now is if Clinton ' s theory -- and the economy -- will unravel as the Fed tightens credit . Yield on 30-year Treasury_bond : July 16 , 1992 : Arkansas Gov . Bill_Clinton wins Democratic presidential nomination Nov . 3 , 1992 : Clinton defeats George_Bush and Ross Perot in presidential election Jan . 20 , 1993 : Clinton inaugurated Aug . 6 , 1993 : Congress narrowly approves sweeping Clinton program of tax increases and spending_cuts Oct . 15 , 1993 : Government reports consumer prices rising at just 2.5 % annual rate Jan . 28 , 1994 : Government reports economy grew at torrid 5.9 % rate in fourth quarter of 1993 Feb . 4 , 1994 : Federal_Reserve boosts short-term interest_rates for first time in five years , raising federal funds rate from 3 % to 3.25 % March 22 , 1994 : Fed boosts funds rate to 3.5 % April 18 , 1994 : Fed boosts funds rate to 3.75 % Mortgage Boomerang Average rates for 30-year home mortgages have tracked the swings in the market for long-term bonds . July ' 92 : 8.04 % Nov . ' 92 : 7.82 % April ' 93 : 7.29 % Oct . ' 93 : 6.76 % Last week : 8.49 % &quot; There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned_around is to tax the middle_class more . . . My plan is a departure from trickle-down economics . . . I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do_it better : invest and grow. &quot; Arkansas Gov . Bill_Clinton , third presidential debate , Oct . 19 , 1992 . &quot; But in the end , we have to get_back to the deficit . For years there ' s been a lot of talk_about it , but very few credible efforts to deal with it . And now I understand why , having dealt with the real_numbers for four weeks. &quot; President Bill_Clinton , State of the Union Address , Feb . 17 , 1993 Note : Final weekly figures , except most recent</TEXT>
