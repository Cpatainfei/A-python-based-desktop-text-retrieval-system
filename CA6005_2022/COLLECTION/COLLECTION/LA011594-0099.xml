   <HEADLINE> BOBBITT TESTIFIES ABOUT MUTILATION OF HER HUSBAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sobbing uncontrollably , Lorena Bobbitt told a hushed and tense courtroom Friday that she cut_off her husband ' s penis with a carving knife because she could no longer endure the rape , beatings and other abuse to which she said she was subjected during their four-year marriage . But on the fourth day of her trial on a charge of malicious wounding , the prosecution sought to discredit Mrs . Bobbitt ' s story during cross-examination by pointing_out several contradictions between her latest testimony and the story she told both before and during the earlier trial of her husband , John Wayne Bobbitt , on charges of sexual_assault . As the cross-examination began , Assistant Commonwealth Atty . Mary Grace O ' Brien zeroed_in on Mrs . Bobbitt ' s contention that she could not remember actually cutting_off her sleeping husband ' s penis after he allegedly raped her following a night of bar-hopping with a friend . O ' Brien noted that Mrs . Bobbitt had described the actual mutilation in previous statements and she indicated that a prosecution witness will testify that Mrs . Bobbitt once threatened to cut_off her husband ' s penis if she ever learned that he was having an affair . The prosecution also asked Mrs . Bobbitt about a history of theft -- noting she had embezzled $ 7 # 200 from the beauty_parlor where she worked as a manicurist and once shoplifted a department_store dress . The line of questioning appeared designed to portray Mrs . Bobbitt as a dishonest , disturbed and vengeful woman who became insanely jealous after learning that her husband indeed was having affairs with several women . Relying mostly on testimony from about a dozen witnesses who said that they saw Bobbitt abuse his wife on numerous occasions , the defense has tried to portray Mrs . Bobbitt as a classic example of a battered wife who should not be held responsible_for a desperate act committed in a moment of extreme emotional distress . As the sensational trial that has both fascinated and horrified the nation nears a conclusion , with a verdict expected sometime next week , it was clear that Lorena Bobbitt ' s fate would depend_on which portrait -- battered spouse or vengeful woman -- the jury of seven women and five men finds more believable . If convicted , the 24-year-old Ecuadorian-born manicurist faces_up to 20 years ' imprisonment and deportation to Venezuela , where she grew_up . John Bobbitt , a 26-year-old bar bouncer and former Marine , has steadfastly denied his wife ' s accusations of abuse . He was acquitted of marital assault charges in the same courtroom in November . Nervously clutching the small gold crucifix that she has worn around her neck throughout the trial , Mrs . Bobbitt took_the_stand Friday for the second day . She testified that near the end of their first year of marriage her husband pressured her into having an abortion , threatening to leave her if she refused and saying that &quot; the baby would be ugly and I would be a terrible mother. &quot; Testifying again about the physical abuse that she has said he visited upon her , Mrs . Bobbitt said that her husband was fascinated by &quot; karate guy movies &quot; and would sometimes practice the moves_on her , kicking her in the stomach , karate-style , whenever their arguments turned violent . &quot; He thought he was Jean Claude Van Damme , &quot; she said in a soft voice , referring to the Belgian-born martial_arts actor . But it was at the point where she began relating her version of the events that led to the mutilation on the morning of June 23 that Mrs . Bobbitt lost the composure she clearly had been struggling to maintain . Awakened by the sound of a door slamming about 3 a.m. , Mrs . Bobbitt said that she heard her husband and a house_guest return home to their small Manassas apartment 30 miles from Washington after a night of drinking . She went_back to sleep , she said , but awoke again to find her husband &quot; on top of me &quot; pinning her arms to her side and pulling_down her underclothes with his foot . &quot; His chest was_on top of me . I couldn ' t breathe . I said : ' What are you doing ? ' He would n ' t say anything . I said I don ' t want to have_sex . He would n ' t let me go . . . . I tried to keep my legs closed . I tried to keep my underwear on but I couldn ' t . . . . Hurt , he hurt me , he was hurting me , &quot; she sobbed uncontrollably . Mrs . Bobbitt said that when her husband had finished with her , she went_into the kitchen to get a glass of water from the refrigerator . Standing there in the dim light cast by the open refrigerator door , she said that she saw the carving knife lying by the sink . She picked it up , she said , and stared at it while memories of past abuse raced through her head . &quot; I remembered many things , &quot; she said in a quavering voice . &quot; I remembered the first time he raped me . I remembered the insults . . . . I remembered the first time he forced me to have anal sex ( and ) the bad things he said . I remember the abortion . I remember everything , &quot; she shuddered in her broken English . She remembered nothing after that , Mrs . Bobbitt said , until she was driving her car to the home of a friend . Looking down , she saw with horror that her husband ' s severed penis was in her left_hand . She said that she immediately threw it out of the car_window into a field , where police subsequently found it . It was later reattached in a nine-hour operation . During her cross-examination , O ' Brien questioned Mrs . Bobbitt ' s memory lapse by noting that she had previously recalled returning to the bedroom , pulling_back the sheets and looking_at her husband before using the knife . She also questioned Mrs . Bobbitt about several other conflicting statements in her most recent testimony . Referring to a rebuttal witness who has not yet been called , she asked the defendant whether she had ever threatened to mutilate her husband for having an extramarital affair . Mrs . Bobbitt denied making a threat . But she broke_into tears once more when she was asked about her history of theft . She said that she felt &quot; ashamed &quot; of her actions but was &quot; desperate &quot; because her husband was frequently out_of_work and took money from her , leaving her without enough to pay bills . The trial is scheduled to continue on Tuesday with testimony by psychiatrists who have examined Mrs . Bobbitt .</TEXT>
