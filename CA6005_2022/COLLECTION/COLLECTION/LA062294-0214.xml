   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; COMMERCENET CREATES THE CYBER MARKETPLACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> CommerceNet hit Silicon_Valley in April like an on-line QVC for technoids -- featuring the latest in workstations and hard_drives rather than electroplated jewelry or ceramic collectibles . Billed as the first large-scale trial of electronic commerce on the Internet , this on-line bazaar enables business customers to shop for computers , software and other electronic gear . It has the backing of some of the biggest names in computer_technology -- including Hewlett-Packard , Intel , Sun Microsystems and Apple Computer , which hope eventually to find a cost-effective market for their products and services . CommerceNet ' s chief partners are Enterprise Integration Technologies Corp. , a Palo Alto consulting company that helps companies do business on the global network ; BarrNet ( Bay Area Regional Research Network ) , a Northern California Internet service provider , and the Stanford_University Center for Information Technology . Cathy J . Medich , an engineer and marketing whiz , came_on board as executive_director in March . At an Internet conference in San Jose recently , she talked_about the promise of CommerceNet . * Q What is CommerceNet ? * A CommerceNet is a consortium . There are two sides of it . One is that we have an on-line Internet server that is a directory that helps people find products . The other side is that we are a working consortium looking_at tackling the business and technical issues of doing business on the Internet . There are some things that need to be done technically to make the Internet a place that ' s appropriate for business . * Q How close are business customers to being able to buy through CommerceNet ? * A Once the buyer finds the seller , you ' re not in CommerceNet anymore . You come_to CommerceNet to find the resource and then you ' re actually directly dealing with the end supplier . People are really just starting with what they ' re offering on the Internet . It turns_out that it ' s a decent-size project to figure_out what you want to offer there , how you want to present yourself , how you ' re going to maintain the data . Companies may have print material that is not organized in searchable databases . So they have to get that sorted_out . that ' s sort of a long-winded answer to say that people aren ' t quite ready yet to do a lot of on-line transactions . But they are ready to have customers come and find_out what ' s available and respond with e-mail or phone to the information . * Q How many businesses are promoting their products through CommerceNet ? * A We have 43 organizations working with us . About 30 have ( computer ) servers up and running . They include H-P , Intel , several divisions of IBM , National Semiconductor , Tandem , Digital , Amdahl , Apple . It ' s very much focused on the computer_industry , since they tend to be the people who are connected to the Internet . * Q But you expect to branch_out ? * A We ' re looking_to see how we can get smaller businesses involved . Our sponsorship membership is $ 35 # 000 a year . Those are consortium members that take_part in the working groups to define standards . It became clear right after the launch that there was a tremendous interest by small and medium-sized companies in participating not necessarily in the consortium but at least in getting the training and getting involved in the Internet . So we ' ve created a subscriber level of $ 1 # 250 a year . It provides a place in the CommerceNet directory and training on how to get_up and running . * Q Bank of America is somehow involved ? * A Yes , BofA , Citicorp , Wells Fargo and First Interstate are all participating . They do a lot of electronic payment and credit now , but not on the Internet . They ' re interested in working with CommerceNet and other members to define how you would do payments on the Internet . We ' re trying not to sit around for two years defining things . We ' re trying to define problems and try things in a very fast start mode rather than talk_about them too long . Our members are moving quickly , saying , &quot; Let ' s try this and come_back and report what worked and what didn ' t work. &quot; Make the fixes , deploy the technology , get other people to use it and through that set_up de_facto standards for doing business on the Internet . * Q Who had the idea ? * A Marty Tenenbaum , the chairman of Enterprise Integration Technologies , proposed it and collaborated with BarrNet and Stanford . They proposed it to the federal_government to get technology reinvestment project funding . We also had the backing of the state of California and Smart Valley , a Silicon Valley-based venture to look_at improving the area ' s competitiveness . CommerceNet was one of 55 projects that was approved out of almost 3 # 000 proposed . We have $ 6 million from the government over three years that we are required to match with industry contributions . * Q Security is obviously a big issue on the Internet . * A The area we ' re focusing_on is transaction security . For that , EIT has developed a secure client-server technology that runs_on the seller ' s computer and Mosaic ( an easy-to-use Internet access program ) , which runs basically on any computer , so that it will allow secure transactions between the two . Both sellers and buyers can get &quot; digital certificates &quot; that attest that they are who they are . The technology will get submitted to the Internet standards body , and we hope it will become the standard way of doing secure transactions . * Q What do you see as the biggest problem facing CommerceNet ? * A Right now it ' s the number of opportunities . There are so many ideas of what we could do and so_much pent-up demand . One of our biggest challenges is to pick the ones we want to focus_on and not get too diverted . Q &amp; A Cathy J . Medich Title : Executive_director of CommerceNet Age : 39 Education : BS and MS in electrical_engineering , MIT ; MBA , Wharton School , University of Pennsylvania Home Computers : A Macintosh II , with color printer ad CD-ROM_drive ; plans to buy a PowerBook Experience : Engineering and marketing at Hewlett-Packard , General Electric , Teradyne and other companies .</TEXT>
