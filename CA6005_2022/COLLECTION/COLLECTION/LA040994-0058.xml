   <TEXT> Should the United Nations have peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina ? Critics deride them . Snipers attack them . U.N. members lag in paying their costs . Many countries -- especially the United States -- refuse to let their troops take_part . In a recent philosophical overview of the difficulties of operating in the Bosnian quagmire , Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali concluded that since a settlement of the war may &quot; at last be within reach , &quot; it is best to soldier on . But his enthusiasm is muted . The overview -- a report to the Security_Council on more_than two years of war in the former Yugoslav federation -- has not received much notice . But it is a remarkable analysis that reflects the secretary_general ' s personal feelings about what went_wrong with the U.N. mission there . As of last month , the U.N. had more_than 30 # 000 peacekeepers in the former Yugoslav federation : 14 # 600 in Croatia , 14 # 400 in Bosnia and 1 # 050 in Macedonia . Since establishing the force known as UNPROFOR ( U.N. Protection Force ) in 1992 , the Security_Council has adopted 54 resolutions and issued 39 statements that , in one way or another , have redefined or added_to the work of the peacekeepers . A frustrating theme runs_through the report : The Security_Council has piled on missions for UNPROFOR without giving it the necessary troop strength and resources . On top of this , Boutros-Ghali believes that the Security_Council , by assigning the United Nations the task of repelling Serbian aggression in certain areas , compromised the United Nations ' impartiality -- &quot; which remains the key to its effectiveness in fulfilling its humanitarian responsibilities. &quot; In his assessment , the secretary_general reaches these conclusions : * Although they never completely secured Sarajevo ' s airport from antiaircraft_fire , the peacekeepers managed to keep it open enough of the time so that 9 # 200 flights carrying 95 # 000 tons of relief supplies could reach the area in a little more_than a year and a half . Attacks on convoys , roadblocks and warfare hampered the distribution of food throughout Bosnia , but these relief efforts -- combined with two mild winters and &quot; the resilience of the population &quot; -- prevented widespread malnutrition and &quot; mitigated the worst effects of the breakdown in essential services. &quot; * Through warnings and the shooting_down of four Bosnian Serb planes Feb . 28 , the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization almost entirely stopped the flights of combat planes over Bosnia . But noncombat planes have violated the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone with impunity , defying the United Nations more_than a_thousand times in a year . * The presence of U.N. peacekeepers deterred Bosnian Serb forces from mounting major assaults on those towns declared &quot; safe areas &quot; by the Security_Council , but the &quot; living conditions in the safe areas remain appalling. &quot; Discussing the safe area of Sarajevo , Boutros-Ghali said the Bosnian capital until recently &quot; suffered heavy shelling and sniping , some of it provoked by offensive actions undertaken by forces &quot; of the Bosnian government . Relative peace finally came_to Sarajevo only after NATO threatened to bomb the Serbian forces if they did not stop their siege . But Boutros-Ghali , clearly frustrated , said the United Nations cannot defend the other safe areas of Bosnia without more troops &quot; equipped adequately to counter the besieging forces and defend UNPROFOR positions. &quot; Nonetheless , he concluded that &quot; the tragedy that provoked UNPROFOR ' s involvement remains an affront to the world ' s conscience . Abstention is not an acceptable option for the international community at such a time. &quot; 30 # 000 on_Duty The United Nations had more_than 30 # 000 peacekeepers in the former Yugoslav federation as of mid-March . Croatia : 14 # 600 troops Bosnia-Herzegovina : 14 # 400 troops Macedonia : 1 # 050 troops The U.N. Toll Over Two years : Cost : $ 1.6 billion Deaths : 79 Wounded : 845</TEXT>
