   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; AFTER AIR STRIKES , NATO WOULD NEVER BE SAME ; BOSNIA : THE FIRST SALVO WOULD CHANGE THE NATURE , STRUCTURE AND SCOPE OF THE ALLIANCE , SENIOR OFFICERS SAY . IT WAS CONCEIVED AS A DEFENSIVE PARTNERSHIP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While diplomats wrangled and snow fell on anguished Sarajevo last week , NATO planners here wrote combat orders for a mission that would launch the 16-nation alliance into uncharted waters . A U.S.-West European partnership that stared_down the Soviet bear for over 40 years without firing a shot prepared with exquisite detail to unleash a fearsome armada of planes against any Serbian gun positions still besieging the Bosnian capital . Their first salvo would change the nature , the structure and the scope of the alliance that won the Cold_War , senior officers say . NATO forces poised this morning on three aircraft_carriers in the Adriatic and bases in Italy are meant to be intimidating . They are also deadly . The outcome is not at_issue if the jets fly against the guns once a get-out-of-town ultimatum expires at 4 p.m. Pacific_time today . &quot; I ' d rather have my job than the job of a ground commander who was trying to shoot artillery at Sarajevo , or to hide , &quot; said U.S. Adm . Jeremy Boorda , who commands NATO ' s southern forces at their headquarters here in the gritty Naples suburb of Bagnoli . To avoid NATO attack , the warring sides must have surrendered their heavy_weapons or have removed them 12 miles from the city by the deadline . For the last three days , they appear to have been making an effort to do so . Boorda ' s confidence in an interview last week was echoed by NATO officers here who were struck by the unprecedented role that the alliance had accepted : armed guarantor of the United Nations . &quot; There ' s been nothing like this for over four decades of NATO , &quot; one senior officer said on condition of anonymity . &quot; And the difference is even greater for the Americans . Having delegated authority , the White_House and the Pentagon remain vital participants , but they ' re not the principal actors once shooting begins. &quot; Air strikes by U.S. , French , British and Dutch jets representing an alliance born in the shards of World_War_II would stir immediate international echoes both novel and far-reaching . They would signal : * NATO ' s first resort_to violence . * An offensive strike by an alliance conceived and grown to maturity as a defensive partnership to guard against outside aggression . * The use of offensive violence outside the territory of one of its members , never contemplated by NATO founders . Just as groundbreaking to American officers here at a polyglot base where partners ' uniforms are as different as the cultures they represent is that Bosnia has forced the jettisoning of a hallowed military principle . &quot; There ' s no Stormin ' Norman this time ; there ' s no unity of command , &quot; said an American officer who remembers allied commander Gen . H . Norman Schwarzkopf from the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War . Rather , the Bosnia collaboration between the United Nations and the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization hinges_on a dual , parallel command structure . On the U.N. side , authority runs_down from Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to Yasushi Akashi , the U.N. special representative for the former Yugoslav republics . Akashi coordinates with French Gen . Jean Cot , commander of the peacekeeping U.N. Protection Force for the former Yugoslav federation . From his headquarters in Zagreb , Croatia , the_French officer confers_with British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia . On the NATO side , Secretary_General Manfred Woerner , a German , sits atop the North Atlantic Council , the alliance ' s highest political body . The council agreed last April to enforce a much-ignored U.N. ban on fixed-wing flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina . NATO Operation Deny Flight began April 12 , 1993 , with U.S. Air_Force and Navy jets first among alliance equals over Bosnian skies -- as they would be in any attacks . In June , NATO foreign_ministers agreed to provide close air support to U.N. troops in Bosnia if requested . Acting within the framework of U.N. resolutions , in August the NATO council ordered planning for air strikes to break the Bosnian Serb stranglehold on Sarajevo , and for possible_action against large-scale interference with humanitarian assistance . U.N. commanders have so far not asked_for that intervention , but in January , NATO heads of government , President Clinton among them , affirmed their readiness to use force under authority of the U.N. Security_Council . On Feb . 9 , the NATO council authorized Boorda as commander of Allied Forces Southern Europe to mount air strikes at U.N. request against artillery or mortar positions around Sarajevo responsible_for attacks on civilians . It also set the 1 a.m. Monday Sarajevo time deadline in coordination with the United Nations . Mostly air-to-air fighters at the start of Deny Flight , NATO aircraft are by now strongly reinforced with fighter-bombers , attack planes and gunships for close air support . The NATO air_force is commanded by U.S. Lt . Gen . Joseph W . Ashby from headquarters here , while day-by-day operational control is directed by Italian Lt . Gen . Antonio Rossetti at Vicenza , in northern Italy . Overall planning and command comes from here in Naples under Boorda , a four-star admiral who is also commander of U.S. naval forces in Europe . In the last 10 days , a net of NATO-U.N. cooperation has been woven in a Naples-Zagreb-Sarajevo triangle . Four times Boorda and aides have flown to Zagreb to confer_with Cot and Rose . &quot; What it comes_down to if the bell rings is Rose-to-Boorda-to-the-pilots , &quot; one senior officer said . It is the pilots , the sharp end of NATO ' s stick , who represent another novelty in preparations for any assault . &quot; In the Gulf , intelligence_officers told attacking units what to expect . This time , the pilots know better than anybody at headquarters what Bosnia ' s like -- they know it like the back of their hands , &quot; said a U.S. officer . Since last year ' s air embargo , NATO pilots have made more_than 11 # 000 flights over Bosnia , 7 # 000 of them in the sort of aircraft that would attack the guns . The pilots also have trained extensively with U.N. forward observers in the_hills around Sarajevo . &quot; By now many pilots and observers are_on a first-name basis -- and they both know where the guns are , &quot; one officer said . If the cards seem stacked , they are -- even without counting friendly technology . What NATO planners call &quot; the warring factions &quot; in Bosnia may scowl at one another through binoculars . NATO is wed to in-flight electronic wizardry . Thanks to it , commanders at_sea and on land can see all_of Bosnia in real time on their desktop_computers . &quot; If the order comes_to fly , we ' ll have done all we can to minimize the fog of war and the strangeness of the place , &quot; a senior American officer said .</TEXT>
