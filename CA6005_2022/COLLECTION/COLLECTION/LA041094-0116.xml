   <HEADLINE> GIVING ELOQUENT VOICE TO ONE IN EIGHT ; A SEARING EXHIBITION AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE ON THE ISSUE OF BREAST_CANCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; One in Eight : Women and Breast_Cancer , &quot; now on display at the Santa Monica College Art_Gallery , is the work of 12 artists who have had breast_cancer . It is not an easy exhibit to view . But then , breast_cancer is not an easy disease to explain or , in many instances , to survive . The growing incidence of breast_cancer -- a disease that according to an upward-revised estimate will afflict one in eight American women -- has brought_forth much anger and debate about the funding for research if not consensus about the disease ' s causation or a cure . &quot; One in Eight &quot; mirrors for breast_cancer the despairing , wry creativity that has marked the suffering and death caused by AIDS . Anger is an easy emotion to stoke amid the growing ranks of breast_cancer survivors . Consider just the recent charges of scientific fraud in large-scale research studies and the continuing -- and confusing -- debate among physicians about the advisability of regular mammograms for younger_women and the efficacy of the less-radical surgical treatment options . Add in the absence of clear progress toward a cure and the alarming number of new cases . Many of the pieces in &quot; One in Eight &quot; reflect that deep , raw frustration ; &quot; Left Breast , No Nipple &quot; displays the artist ' s breast prothesis atop a circular_saw blade , mounted on black velvet . To be sure , there are victories in the war against breast_cancer , survivors , even apparent cures . The &quot; One in Eight &quot; artists are certainly among them . In &quot; Some Days You Feel So Alive &quot; a woman dances against a magnificent sunset . But still the casualties mount . Forty-six thousand deaths from the disease are predicted this year alone . Art gives voice to the despair . And sometimes art prompts hard questions about how we allocate increasingly scarce federal research dollars and how we might do_better -- questions that can change policy . This year the National Institutes for Health is spending $ 10 billion on research , $ 204 million specifically on breast_cancer . Is this enough ? No . Proposed federal legislation would increase research spending substantially through a 1 % surcharge on health_insurance premiums . The plan could generate an additional $ 6 billion annually . More for breast_cancer , more for AIDS , more for Parkinson ' s disease , and so on . The idea is_well worth exploring . &quot; One in Eight &quot; runs_through April 23 ( the exhibit is dark this Monday through Saturday , during the Santa Monica College spring break ) .</TEXT>
