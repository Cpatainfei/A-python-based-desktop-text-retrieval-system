   <TEXT> Not far from the madding crowds pushing their luck on casino slot_machines and keno here is a large industrial warehouse with an unbelievably clean floor . The outside of the pink building describes it as a bra and girdle establishment , but the interior is filled with various large implements of destruction that have nothing to do with underwear . Near the center stands a massive Death Saw , its silver blades bearing no evidence of the man it has severed in half numerous times . Close by is a bed of tall , uninviting spikes that once sat hungrily under the same man as he dangled precariously above from burning ropes . A glass case contains a 500-pound spike that could pierce a person in two . All around the warehouse , as if warily watching all comers , are the brooding eyes of David Copperfield , their hypnotic gaze topped by impossibly dense eyebrows as they stare from large billboards and posters advertising &quot; The Magic of David Copperfield. &quot; The facility is the disguised headquarters where the magic profession ' s most prominent practitioner keeps his more elaborate illusions and a secluded bachelor lair for the rare occasions when he isn ' t on_the_road . Even more eerie are the two rooms hidden in the bowels of the warehouse that are filled with the ghosts of wizards and conjurers past : Harry Houdini ' s Metamorphosis trunk , the first trunk ever used in the illusion of disappearances . The Chung Ling Soo rifle , believed to be the weapon used when the Chinese magician performed his famous bullet-catching trick one too many times . Dante ' s Spirit Cabinet . Maskelyne ' s Decapitated Princess Chair . Orson Welles ' Buzzsaw Illusions . Hundreds of ancient volumes of witchcraft and magic . In these rooms of mysteries and nightmares , David Copperfield finds solace and comfort . &quot; Sometimes I wake_up in the middle of the night and come_in here , and I feel all_right , &quot; the master magician said quietly , sitting in a chair amid the priceless collection . &quot; I don ' t feel_like it ' s ghostly . In fact , it ' s a rather peaceful place . And it makes me feel peaceful knowing I ' ve carried_on the tradition of the people here , and that I ' ve become a part of a very rich tapestry of artists who deserve a lot of respect. &quot; * As he spoke , several magicians honored in the rooms -- Channing Pollock , Jack Kodell , Norm Nielsen -- wandered with wide-eyed admiration through the collection , known as the International Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts . Copperfield calls it the world ' s largest repository of antiquarian books , magic , illusion and other works_on magic . He bought much of it in 1991 from the Resolution Trust Corp. , an agency appointed to clean_up the nation ' s savings-and-loan debacle by selling some of the failed thrift companies ' assets . The collection had been formed by Carl M . Rheuban , an amateur magician and former chairman of the now-defunct First Network Savings in Los Angeles . ( The exhibits can be viewed only by guests of Copperfield and are not open_to the public. ) While Pollock , Kodell and Nielsen , elder_statesmen in the world of magic , marveled at the artifacts , it was clear from the chatty enthusiasm toward their host that they not only value Copperfield ' s respect for their craft but also are in awe that this 37-year-old multimillionaire with sculpted cheekbones , matinee-idol looks and a tan that would turn George Hamilton brown with envy has elevated magic to a mainstream popularity they never dreamed possible . &quot; Copperfield is the king , &quot; said Pollock , who used to produce doves out of nowhere in his appearances on &quot; The Ed Sullivan Show. &quot; &quot; He ' s reached a much wider audience than any of us combined . I ' ve never seen a magician that is so universally loved. &quot; Indeed , no other magician has hosted high-rated annual network specials for 15 years , the latest of which is a retrospective , &quot; David Copperfield -- 15 Years of Magic , &quot; airing Thursday at 8 p.m. on CBS . Or has made the Statue_of_Liberty , an airplane and a 70-ton train car from the Orient Express vanish in front of a live television audience . Or has escaped_from an imploding building to appear moments later nearby in the middle of a solid sheet of steel . Or has appeared on the cover of Forbes as one of the world ' s richest entertainers . And while prominent magicians such_as the self-proclaimed &quot; bad boys of magic , &quot; Penn &amp; Teller , and the Las Vegas magic kings Siegfried &amp; Roy have their own set of impressive tricks_up their sleeves , even they have never accomplished what many consider to be Copperfield ' s greatest feat , the trick that has gotten him a higher profile than any of his other spectacular illusions : getting engaged to German super-model Claudia Schiffer . The coupling propelled Copperfield instantly into jet-set status : He was a recent cover boy for Esquire ( along with veteran cover_girl Schiffer , of course ) , and they have been photographed at the Academy Awards and many other paparazzi -heavy happenings . He presented an award Wednesday to singer Gloria Estefan at the World Music Awards in Monaco after performing 12 sold-out shows at the Fox Theatre in Detroit . In Monaco , he stayed with Schiffer at her home there as he filmed promos for an extensive European tour . His engagement also has made him the butt of jokes , as evidenced by a comic sonata a_few weeks ago by the &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; character Operaman : &quot; Copperfield , Coppa-feelo . Operaman no comprendo . Il Dorko has hot girlfriend-o. &quot; &quot; Oh , you mean that joke on ' Saturday Night Dead ' ? &quot; Copperfield retorted when asked about the barb . &quot; I don ' t really mind . It ' s not like that show has a whole_lot of viewers anyway . And when you ' re going out with the most beautiful girl in the world , there are some guys who are going_to take shots at you. &quot; In the end , it ' s not the higher visibility but the magic that matters_to Copperfield . He seems to be vying for the title of &quot; the hardest-working magician in show_business , &quot; playing more_than 500 shows a year all_over the world in addition to putting_together his television specials . He wants not only to amaze the audience and overcome their preconceptions of what magic is but also to arouse them , make them fear for him , appreciate the art , even move them to tears . &quot; People think_of magic and think_of their uncle doing bad card_tricks , &quot; Copperfield said . &quot; You have to see my work to respect it. &quot; He paused . &quot; But you go_to any Broadway show -- ' Phantom , ' ' Les Miserables ' -- and then come straight to my show , and , I ' ll be real cocky right now , my show will make you cry just like ' Les Miz. ' My show will make you laugh more_than ' Les Miz , ' &quot; he said , adding the last comment with a chuckle . &quot; I want to involve audiences , make them feel_for me . I want to make my shows romantic and passionate . It ' s a theatrical experience . Magic can do that. &quot; * Only a_few hours after escorting the magicians through the archives , Copperfield pops_up before an enthusiastic sold-out Caesars Palace audience to perform his brand of very theatrical magic . The show , titled &quot; Beyond Imagination , &quot; contains elements that might make many_a more traditional magician want to pull a hat over him . Influenced by the showmanship of his idols -- Gene Kelly , Walt Disney , Fred Astaire , Steven Spielberg -- Copperfield fills the performance with large-scale effects like a major rock_concert : chest-pounding music by Genesis and other artists , blinking lights , posing and dancing , elaborate special_effects , slinky female assistants who eagerly wrap their taut bodies around Copperfield ' s lean physique and rub him suggestively . During a variation on Houdini ' s Metamorphosis trick , even a subtle touch of S &amp; M enters the mix , as one of the assistants binds Copperfield in a silky , cocoon-like enclosure , looking_at him lovingly as she ties his wrists . The cocoon lifts_off the platform and the woman quickly lifts a sheet in front of her . Then a shattering boom , the sheet comes_down and Copperfield is standing where the woman had been . The cocoon is uncovered and the woman stands smiling , bound at the wrists . The audience , composed of both the MTV crowd and older out-of-towners , goes wild . Among the viewers cheering the loudest are a couple sitting near the middle of the showroom who have seen Copperfield perform hundreds of times . They bounce to the ear-pounding music , laugh_at his every joke and marvel at each trick as if they were seeing it for the first time . They are Copperfield ' s parents , Hy and Rebecca Kotkin . Hy Kotkin runs his son ' s fan club , David Copperfield International , which publishes a quarterly newsletter , &quot; Backstage With David. &quot; &quot; We never get tired_of seeing him , &quot; said Rebecca Kotkin , shouting to be heard above the din . &quot; We see it through other people ' s eyes . We like to see how everyone responds to him . But don ' t ask me how he does this stuff . I don ' t know and I don ' t want to know . I just want to enjoy. &quot; As the show progressed , Copperfield paraded through his various personas -- a sensual sorcerer , a charming flirt who enjoys bantering with women in the audience , a storefront magician who still has his sleight-of-hand chops and can conjure a real red rose out of a paper rose with a snap of his fingers and a burst of flame , and the innocent , adolescent only child from Metuchen , N.J. , named David Kotkin , who dreamed of escaping his loneliness and insecurities by flying like a bird . Near the end of &quot; Beyond Imagination , &quot; Copperfield lives his dream : He flies , apparently without the aid of strings or wires . He glides back and forth across the stage , turns a graceful roll in midair , flies in a large plastic case that has a lid on top . He even takes a female audience member up_in_the_air with him , playing Superman to her unwitting Lois Lane . Flying also marks the big finale for this week ' s TV special , which co-stars Schiffer as a miniskirted reporter who stumbles across Copperfield in a fictional studio / warehouse . After showing clips from his previous specials , Copperfield escorts Schiffer to high atop the building , where he lifts her in his arms and they fly off . He calls flying his most difficult illusion , explaining that it took seven years of training to perfect . Other tricks -- such_as the Fires of Passion , in which he escapes_from a straitjacket while dangling from burning ropes 100 feet above a bed of flaming spikes -- took a year of training . &quot; I would go_out after my shows and just work_on getting_it down , &quot; he said . It ' s the big set_pieces for which Copperfield is most famous : making the Statue_of_Liberty disappear , walking through the Great Wall of China , plunging over Niagara Falls , levitating across the Grand_Canyon . His trademark is proving that all_the tricks are done live_in front of spectators at the scene and the television audience without camera cutaways or gimmicks . Many of those clips are repeated in the CBS special . &quot; I was doing a lot of smaller-scale , emotional things on my specials , then I decided to do something a little different on my earlier specials and made a car and airplane disappear , &quot; Copperfield recalled . &quot; All of a sudden I got all this added attention . Those big tricks became the illusions that I could hang my hat on . But I found that bigger isn ' t necessarily better . My whole show now is based around flying , which is a big emotional thing. &quot; Despite the extravagant scale of his illusions -- &quot; Beyond Imagination &quot; costs millions , and Copperfield ' s elaborate sets and props require a separate jumbo jet to transport -- touching the audience emotionally remains a primary goal of Copperfield ' s magic . &quot; It ' s important for the audience to put themselves in my position , &quot; Copperfield said as he relaxed backstage following one of his Caesars Palace shows . &quot; Every three years or so , I put myself in a dangerous spot . Through it , I -- and they -- can see that they can conquer fear , conquer panic . I want to take the audience with me . When I fly , hopefully they ' re flying with me . I try to be every man and woman so that the audience can live through me. &quot; Copperfield still appears driven to_the_point where it seems his greatest trick is finding time to sleep . While on_the_road , he often performs as_many as three shows a day . In one recent stretch , he spent Wednesday filming commercials all day at the warehouse for his upcoming TV special , performed &quot; Beyond Imagination &quot; at Caesars that night and then was driven to Los Angeles immediately afterward so that he could spend Thursday editing the TV_program . He flew to Las Vegas that evening for &quot; Beyond Imagination , &quot; then did a media interview after the show , which ended at 2 a.m. He did interviews with &quot; CBS This Morning &quot; and other reporters a_few hours later Friday . Then there were two more shows that night , and two on Saturday . His parents said their son ' s frenzied pace is no surprise to them . The couple , who now reside in San Diego , recalled how the young David Kotkin used to entertain himself . &quot; He was always very precocious , looking_for things and small magic_tricks to do with his hands , &quot; said Hy Kotkin . He was performing professionally at age 12 . By 16 , he was teaching magic at New York University . He took the name David Copperfield when he was cast in a Chicago musical , &quot; The Magic Man. &quot; Even with the hectic work schedule and lifestyle , Copperfield said he keeps trying to top himself . &quot; Many magicians work their whole lives trying to get 15 minutes of material , but I have to come_up with a new hour of material every year for my TV special , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s like my record_album . It forces me to come_up with new stuff . I don ' t really have a choice. &quot; Peter Tortorici , president of CBS Entertainment , described Copperfield as &quot; the ultimate showman . You can ' t be a master illusionist without having every possible detail taken_care of . He has that undefinable something . You can ' t take your eyes off him. &quot; Copperfield , however , is keenly aware that more eyes are_on him these days because of his relationship with Schiffer . He says the added attention doesn ' t bother him . &quot; None of this is a problem -- although it is sometimes inconvenient , &quot; he said . &quot; I mean , that ' s why they call it a private life -- because it is supposed to be private . I ' ve always had a girlfriend over the years , but it was always kept quiet . I never went_to premieres . I was always working . Maybe because I kept my lifestyle private for so many years , I didn ' t appear on as_many magazines . But my ratings were never a problem , and my ticket sales were never a problem . &quot; However , when the woman you become engaged to is_on the cover of every magazine around and is the most beautiful woman in the world , people are naturally interested . So it ' s a new concept for me. &quot; He ' s not dismayed that discussion of his magic disappears in the media spotlight : &quot; If you go_to the magazine stands and see all_the articles about actors and actresses , about 10 % of the story is about the art of acting , and about 90 % is about who they ' re married to , who they ' re dating , who they ' re breaking_up with . It ' s rarely about the work , and mostly about the lifestyle . I just have to keep it all_in perspective. &quot; Copperfield met Schiffer last year during a tour of Germany that was front-page news in newspapers around the country before he played a single performance . He picked her out of the audience at a gala performance for a trick in which he &quot; predicts &quot; what kind of graffiti audience members will write_on a wall . When the pair started dating , the German media reacted with a frenzy . Now that he has wealth , fame , security and &quot; the most beautiful girl in the world , &quot; Copperfield stressed that his life will not change all that much . &quot; I will slow_down a little , but I love doing what I do and will not change all that drastically , &quot; he said . &quot; Also , my fiancee loves what she is doing. &quot; How about having a family ? &quot; I hope so , &quot; he said softly . * When off stage , Copperfield can seem distant and , some say , aloof . Performing seems to be the aspect of his life in which he finds most comfort . &quot; It ' s really my sanctuary , &quot; he said in explaining why he keeps_up such a relentless touring schedule . &quot; I love interacting with the audience . It ' s different each night. &quot; Having a television retrospective at age 37 is a bit unnerving : &quot; It was the furthest thing from my mind . I ' m always looking_forward , so it ' s strange to look_back -- especially at some of the haircuts I ' ve had. &quot; Even more spectacular magic is in_store , he said . &quot; I want to straighten the Tower of Pisa . I want to make the moon disappear . I want to put a woman ' s face on Mount Rushmore. &quot; But , as he stands_up , ending the backstage interview , Copperfield knows he has many_more performances of &quot; Beyond Imagination &quot; to do before undertaking his next spectacular trick . No more time for talking . Time to fly. *</TEXT>
