   <TEXT> Romania vs . Switzerland * TIME : 1 p.m. * TV : ESPN , Univision * KEY MATCHUPS : It might be a ploy , but Swiss Coach Roy Hodgson insists he will not tinker with the game_plan that resulted in a lackluster 1-1 tie against the United States . This , despite protestations at_home , where Hodgson was ripped in the press for deploying only one striker , the talented Stephane Chapuisat , in the opener . Hodgson went_to the formation because of an ankle injury to forward Adrian Knup , who did not play . The one-forward theory , the experts vented , put too_much pressure on Thomas Bickel at midfield . Sonntagsblick , the mass-circulation newspaper , called Hodgson ' s decision a &quot; fatal mistake. &quot; Even Chapuisat says he does not like to play alone in the attack . Romania , which smothers the midfield , stunned Colombia , 3-1 , and is out_to show that was no fluke . The Swiss defense will have to contain Romania ' s 1-2 punch of Gheorghe Hagi and Florin Raducioiu . Hagi , the brilliant playmaker , scored against Colombia and set_up the other goals , both scored by Raducioiu . * OUTLOOK : A pivotal game for teams that have not tasted much World Cup success . Knup has practiced for two days and appears ready to play , which might convince Hodgson to change tactics . With a victory , Romania can assure itself a return trip to the second round . A victory would put Switzerland back on track , but the team can ill afford a loss or a tie , knowing it still must face Colombia in group play . * OUTCOME : The Swiss are more desperate for a victory , but it appears that coach and players are not on the same page , which is never a good sign . Emotionally , Romania could be flat in the wake of its upset of Colombia but it should have enough firepower to squeeze_out a hard-fought , 2-1 victory . CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
