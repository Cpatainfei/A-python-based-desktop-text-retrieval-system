   <HEADLINE> INTERPLAY DIGS DEEP TO DEVELOP DISCS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a decade of producing computer_games on floppy_disks , the head of Interplay Productions Inc. in Irvine gave the order last year to shut_down all new production of such titles . Instead , company President Brian Fargo invested $ 3 million in new computer equipment and diverted all development money to CD-ROM games . He feared a drop_in sales as the company shifted , but the trough never appeared . &quot; I believe it ' s going_to be a CD-ROM world , at least by Christmas , &quot; Fargo said in an interview at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January . &quot; CD-ROM is steaming ahead. &quot; Even with 20 CD-ROM projects already being developed , Interplay is digging deep into its pockets for money to do more . Last week , the company announced that it has invested in Northstar Studios , a new Palo Alto company headed by video_game industry veteran Ronald Spitzer . Fargo said the investment was a strategic move that will generate CD-ROM games and games on other platforms for Interplay over the next several years . With an estimated $ 60 million in 1993 sales , Interplay is now Orange County ' s second-largest video_game company behind Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc. Half of its revenue comes from CD-ROM game sales , Fargo said . Besides creating new titles , Interplay is making money by converting older floppy_disk titles to the CD-ROM format . In the next several months , the company plans to release a new version of &quot; Sim City &quot; -- a popular game that simulates the growth or decline of cities -- on CD-ROM with video and enhanced computer animations . An added incentive for such conversions is that the CDs are a read-only format , so they can ' t be pirated easily . The data is permanently encoded and can ' t be erased or modified . Fargo estimates that for every floppy-disk game his company sold , eight to 10 illegal copies were made . Some rewritable discs are being made , but the CD-ROM_drives necessary to play them are expensive . Yamaha Corp . of America in Buena Park plans to introduce one such product this spring for about $ 3 # 000 . &quot; We don ' t want the industry to create a rewritable CD as a standard , &quot; Fargo said . &quot; If that happens , then we ' re back to the drawing board. &quot; DEAN TAKAHASHI</TEXT>
