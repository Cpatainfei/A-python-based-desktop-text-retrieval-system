   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 : DAYS AND COUNTING ; ' 90 NIGHTMARE ; LAST WORLD CUP PART OF NETWORK OF CORRUPTION THAT LEFT ITALY REELING AND CHANGED IT FOREVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was scandalous , people said , when Italy failed to reach the finals in the World Cup it staged four summers ago . Little did they know . Investigators are still chasing billions of lire that inexplicably fell_off trucks en route to Italia 90 . Cell doors will be closing for years to come . No one disputes the smooth operation of the tournament itself , any more_than there is anything beyond lingering chagrin over Italy ' s heartbreaking semifinal loss to Argentina on penalty kicks . But all_of Italy bears a grudge against the cozy cabal of big-shot politicians and businessmen who looted their country in the name of world soccer as part of a nationwide network of corruption . Just as Italian soccer is different on the field today in part because of the Italia 90 results , so , too , is Italy a different country politically in its aftermath . &quot; The way in which Italian parties and cities approached the Mondiale was the last example of a bad way to approach public business , &quot; said Luca di Montezemolo , who headed the Italia 90 organizing committee . &quot; It was the last example of behavior that I hope is completely finished in Italy. &quot; Montezemolo , 46 , president of the auto_maker Ferrari , spent four years arranging Italy ' s role as host for the tournament as head of the private organizing committee . In 12 cities across Italy , on the peninsula and in the islands of Sardinia and Sicily , the 52-game championship unfolded seamlessly . Underlying the sport was massive infrastructural overhaul : telephone_lines , television satellite links , roads , rail_lines and stations , two new stadiums and exorbitant face_lifts for the others . &quot; Overall it was a good thing , &quot; Montezemolo said . &quot; We have modern , safe stadiums , roads , an improved airport in Rome . More was accomplished around the event than in the previous 10 years . Unfortunately , Italy is a place where it is difficult to get things done if there is no pressure . Earthquakes , a World Cup , the Olympic Games , they make things happen . Events proved a good excuse to do things that would n ' t be done without them. &quot; A month before the Cup began , all_of Italy was a construction site . Nothing was ready ; people despaired . Speaking with a Times reporter four weeks before the opening game , Montezemolo was asked if Italy would embarrass itself before the world : &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; he replied . To prepare_for games that were seen as priceless international advertising for Italy , the national and local_governments contracted big Italian companies for needed and ambitious public works budgeted at about $ 4 billion . They wound_up paying much more . One reason , it turned_out later , was that there were so many greedy fingers in the pie . Rome ' s Olympic Stadium , site of the final , cost almost three times more to enlarge and improve than the original estimate . Milan ' s San Siro Stadium and Naples ' San Paolo are among the targets of corruption probes . Also being investigated are circumstances surrounding the construction of multimillion-dollar white_elephant train_stations in Rome built for the Cup but now abandoned . &quot; I would never do_it again , &quot; Montezemolo said . &quot; They were four terrible years , always fighting with people , trying to explain that our committee had nothing to do with the infrastructure . It was good to modernize , but not the cost. &quot; About 18 months after Italia 90 , magistrates in Milan began unraveling what has become the biggest scandal in Italian history : The World Cup was just one savory dish on a banquet table of corruption in which businesses paid_off political_parties and individuals in exchange for government contracts . Popular revulsion triggered a revolt at the polls earlier this year : Italy ' s political establishment oversaw Italia 90 with well-fed smiles , but now the avuncular men and parties that ruled for more_than four decades are in disgrace . More_than 3 # 000 politicians and businessmen are implicated in probes of massive corruption in which soccer was only a modest sideline . March elections brought_to power right-wing parties promising clean government and led by billionaire media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi , a soccer fanatic whose holdings include champion AC Milan . &quot; Today , with a different government , things could be different , &quot; Montezemolo said . &quot; We might be able to do the same with a different moral ethic. &quot; If Italy is a sadder but wiser place four years later , its national soccer team is also poorer , in the eyes of most of its fans . The Italian team , which will play a final tuneup match against Costa Rica on Saturday at New Haven , Conn. , flew to the United States Tuesday as 70 % of callers were telling one national sports daily that they had no confidence in the team . A 1992 housecleaning swept out many Italia 90 players , including high-scoring striker Salvatore Schillaci , as well as coach Azeglio Vicini , who was replaced by Arrigo Sacchi , winner of every title in_sight at AC Milan . Sacchi demands more exciting soccer than the traditional Italian catenaccio -- pass-to-pass in a long chain . Sacchi looks_for a more open game with more room for offense . Seven or eight years ago , Italy played man-to-man defense . Today , the Azzurri , like many first division clubs , plays a zone defense , according to Giorgio Tutino , a Rome sportswriter who has covered Italian soccer for three decades . &quot; Italy used to play a long game , with key forwards and two or three defenders always back . that ' s a recipe for 0-0 , 1-0 . Now Italy plays short -- lots of attackers , lots of defenders , &quot; Tutino said . The trouble is , Italy hasn ' t looked good in Cup warm-ups . It beat Switzerland , 1-0 , in Rome last week , but the_Swiss played better . There are a lot of Italian nerves riding_on their World Cup opener on June 18 against Ireland at East Rutherford , N.J. Some of them belong_to Luca di Montezemolo . &quot; I ' m trying to decide whether to go_to the Ireland game , &quot; said Montezemolo , who is vice_president of third-division Bologna , a former first-division powerhouse trying to claw back_up the ladder . He ' s been watching preparations for the Cup as a fan -- and , deja_vu , as a survivor . &quot; The Americans have many advantages , &quot; Montezemolo said . &quot; The mentality is different in the United States ; there is a great willingness to volunteer ; the pressure is also less because soccer is not as popular . Then , too , nobody expects huge new things from the United States ; the country is already well-organized . &quot; But the Americans have disadvantages : Because the distances are huge ; because I don ' t think people will be as totally involved as in Italy . And because it is easy to make mistakes in something of this size. &quot; * The Times continues the second phase of its informational graphics series designed to increase readers ' knowledge of soccer leading_up to the World Cup .
