   <HEADLINE> SWEDEN FOLLOWS AUSTRIA , FINLAND WITH VOTE TO JOIN EUROPEAN UNION ; SCANDINAVIA : THE STRONG 52.2 % APPROVAL COMES AS A SURPRISE AFTER PRE-BALLOTING POLLS SHOWED AN EVEN SPLIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the end of a long and intensely emotional campaign , Sweden on Sunday voted solidly in favor of abandoning its Arctic isolation and joining the European Union . Sweden ' s approval follows similar yes votes_in Austria and Finland this year and is expected to give a boost to a referendum at the end of the month in neighboring Norway , where opposition has been strong . The addition of all four countries would make the EU the world ' s largest and richest free-trade bloc , surpassing North_America , and could help speed the integration of the Eastern and Central European_countries hoping to join . The vote -- billed as the most important decision this century for Sweden ' s 8.7 million citizens -- was 52.2 % to 46.9 % , with nearly 1 % of the ballots left blank . The strong approval came as a surprise , with polls right up_to voting day showing an even split and a fifth of voters still undecided . But the pro-EU campaign launched a strong last-minute push , with Social Democratic Prime_Minister Ingvar Carlsson and his political rival , former Prime_Minister Carl Bildt , arguing on the same side during a nationally televised debate . &quot; This is a happy day , &quot; Carlsson said at a news_conference following the vote . &quot; I believe we can be good for Europe . We will be an active partner . This brings us new possibilities. &quot; Sweden , a fiercely independent country connected to continental Europe primarily by ferries , was divided over whether joining forces with its neighbors would mean more or less employment , democracy and social_welfare . The issues of the campaign dug deep into the Swedish psyche . Fear ran high that entering the EU would compromise the country ' s commitment to political neutrality , human equality and environmental protection . For 150 years , Swedes have pursued a policy of neutrality that kept them out of two world_wars and made them a buffer between the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and Soviet Bloc nations . They created a capitalist country with a generous welfare_state that made them a kind of third alternative to communism and U.S.-style free-marketeering . But many Swedes have argued lately that neutrality is an outdated policy in the wake of the Cold_War . And Sweden ' s economy is reeling from two decades of slow growth that has resulted in 14 % unemployment and a budget_deficit near 13 % of the gross_national_product . The pro-EU campaign , supported by most political_leaders , big business and the country ' s largest national newspapers , clearly outspent opponents in pressing their case that this was the country ' s only chance to turn_around the economy and prevent cuts_in the country ' s generous social_welfare system . A no vote , they warned , would drive_up interest_rates and scare_off investment to EU countries . &quot; If we want social_welfare , we have got_to get_to work and pay taxes . The public sector is not self-propelling . It needs a locomotive , &quot; Carlsson argued in the key debate before the vote . He also argued that Sweden must have a voice in European economic and security policy decisions that inevitably affect the country . &quot; I want us to be there when decisions are made , not just standing_by hoping Finland and Denmark represent our interests , &quot; he said . Support was greatest in the cities , among office workers and professionals . Opposition was strongest among environmentalists , farmers , workers and many women , all_of whom feared economic intervention from Brussels , the seat of the EU , and a loss of sovereignty over political decisions . In all three Scandinavian_countries voting on the issue this year , opposition has been strong in the Arctic north and other rural_areas . Sweden ' s farmers said they would lose government subsidies that allow them to build hothouses to heat crops . One issue among women was equal rights . Swedish women look_at Germany , where half as_many women work outside the home , and fear for their jobs and child_care services . Agnetha Stark , a leader of the anti-EU campaign , said Carlsson and Bildt ' s &quot; trust us &quot; strategy had won_over voters . Turnout was high on a cold but sunny November day . In Stockholm ' s Old Town , Taeppas Fugelberg , an author and journalist , voted against the referendum . &quot; I think the question of democracy being transferred from Stockholm to Brussels is rather disgusting , &quot; he said , adding that Sweden &quot; is like a refrigerator full of yummies , and the rest of Europe will empty it. &quot; But Raoul Toenisson , the director of an export company , voted with the majority for integration . &quot; The world is globalizing . I have a vision of a united Europe , and this is the first_step , &quot; he said . &quot; We want to be a part of Europe , &quot; concurred banker Per Harrison . &quot; Switzerland is out ( of the EU ) , but they are a very , very rich country . We are borrowing money , and they are lending . that ' s the difference. &quot; Sweden ' s vote is non-binding , but the Parliament is virtually certain to ratify it . If the three Scandinavian_countries join in January along with Austria , the EU will become a bloc of 16 countries with open borders for trade , movement of capital and citizens of member countries . The union also seeks a common currency and security policy . Many Swedes feared that their country is too small to have a real voice in the EU . The Scandinavian_countries may form a bloc with Denmark , already a member , that gives them 13 votes on a 90-seat European Council of Ministers . That is not enough to form a blocking minority , but it is more_than Germany , which is seen as the big_brother of the EU . Although Sweden has cooperated with NATO peacekeeping missions , the country is not likely to join NATO . But political observers do not rule_out participation in an eventual EU security organization . The vote is likely to leave a lot of discontent in a country so committed to consensus that the government helped to finance both the yes and no campaigns . Carlsson , whose party was divided over the issue , allowed Cabinet members to campaign against integration .</TEXT>
