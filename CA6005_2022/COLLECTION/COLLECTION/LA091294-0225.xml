   <HEADLINE> JAPAN UNDERGOING A MODERATE RECOVERY , OFFICIALS SAY ; ECONOMY : OTHERS DISAGREE ; J.P. MORGAN PREDICTS FALL IN INVESTMENT . VALUE OF AUTO SALES FLAT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is Japan ' s worst post-World War II recession over ? In a report interpreted by the mass media here as the official word of the end of the three-year slump , the government said last week that , in_essence , things are looking_up . The economy has turned &quot; toward a moderate recovery , &quot; the Economic Planning Agency ( EPA ) said in its monthly report to the Cabinet -- continuing months of caution on forecasting the direction of the struggling economy . But the EPA also warned that a &quot; full-fledged &quot; upswing could not be foreseen until companies ' investments in factory equipment stops declining and apprehensions over the impact of the surge in the yen disappear . &quot; The sun , once it rises , doesn ' t reverse course , but we can ' t say that about our economy , &quot; EPA Minister Masahiko Komura said . Tsutomu Tanaka , the agency ' s vice minister , was more optimistic . He said the economy could achieve the goal of 2.4 % growth that the government set_in its fiscal 1994 budget . Isamu Miyazaki , head of the Daiwa Research Institute and a former EPA vice minister , said growth would range between 1 % and 1.5 % this fiscal_year and reach 3 % in fiscal 1995 , even without full recovery in corporate profits and investment . Equipment investment , he said , would turn upward in mid-1995 . But J.P. Morgan in its own report Friday predicted that investment would decline 7 % this year and fall again by 0.5 % next year . The recession , by EPA calculations , began in May , 1991 , in the aftermath of the bursting of a &quot; bubble &quot; of excessive investment in plant equipment , stocks and land in the late 1980s . Last year , growth all but halted , with gross_domestic_product increasing only a tenth of a percent . The agency cited as reasons for its cautious optimism a continuing high level of housing construction , increases in production , a pickup in consumer spending spurred by a $ 55-billion refund to taxpayers in late June and early July and improved business confidence . The EPA failed to mention it , but strong exports also have added a prop . Just a week ago , however , Hideo Sakamaki , president of Nomura Securities , declared that &quot; the future is still a black_hole . Japan is still in a tunnel , and we can ' t see the exit. &quot; Sakamaki also said that the country ' s capital markets are &quot; not functioning &quot; to provide funds needed for growth . Kenneth S . Courtis , strategist and senior economist for Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Asia , said banks ' bad loans , which he estimated at about $ 650 billion , or 8 % of the banks ' assets , &quot; represent a major negative for the entire economy. &quot; Continued contraction of bank lending because of that debt burden , he said , &quot; makes_it , at best , problematic for the economy to expand any time soon. &quot; Yutaka Kume , chairman of Nissan Motors , also remained pessimistic . &quot; I can understand that the politicians in the government want to say that the economy has recovered , but to us in the auto industry , it just feels that we have finally hit the bottom , &quot; he said . Sales of trucks started increasing just last April in comparison with a year earlier , and auto sales began picking_up only in July , he noted . Customers , moreover , have switched to buying smaller cars and recreation vehicles , and as a result the value of sales still has not increased , he complained .</TEXT>
