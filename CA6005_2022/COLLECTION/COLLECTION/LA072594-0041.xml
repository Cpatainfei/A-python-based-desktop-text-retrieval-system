   <HEADLINE> KIM IS NO MADMAN , KIDNAPED PAIR SAY ; NORTH_KOREA : FILM COUPLE , CAPTIVES FOR EIGHT YEARS , DESCRIBE NEW RULER AS A METICULOUS PLANNER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> North_Korea ' s new leader , Kim Jong Il , is not quite the &quot; madman &quot; portrayed in press reports in the West but rather a meticulous planner who executes his projects with iron determination , according to South_Korea ' s premier actress and film director , who were kidnaped by Kim and held captive for eight years in Pyongyang . Had he been born to another life instead of being the eldest son of Kim Il Sung , the world ' s longest-reigning dictator until his death earlier this month , the younger Kim might have made a great movie producer , Choi Eun Hee and her husband , Shin Sang Okk , said in an interview with The Times . As experts try to figure_out what Kim is really like , negative images persist of a man who abuses alcohol and women and is possibly unpredictable enough to start a nuclear war . The pudgy 52-year-old , who loves movies and the theater as much as his Hennessy cognac , was such a devotee of Stalin that he would use &quot; any means &quot; -- including the abduction of innocent artists such_as themselves -- to fulfill his goals , the couple said . Kim Jong Il is suspected to be the mastermind of the 1983 bombing in Burma ( now Myanmar ) that killed more_than a dozen South_Korean officials and the 1987 midair bombing of a South_Korean airliner that killed all 115 aboard -- to frighten people from coming_to Seoul during the 1988 Olympics . To be sure , Choi , 63 , and Shin , 67 , know the frightening side of Kim -- it was_on his orders that they were kidnaped to North_Korea from Hong Kong six months apart in 1978 , then not even told for years if the other was alive . But while South_Korea ' s most famous movie couple still cringe when recalling their captor , they also speak_of him without rancor , almost dispassionately , as if they were discussing a main character in a movie they were making . Despite his terrorist past , the Kim Jong Il they knew between 1978 and 1986 would not start a nuclear war -- because that would amount to a suicide for his nation , said Shin , who had many long talks with Kim . &quot; He is not as rash as he appears to those who don ' t know the inner workings of North_Korea . North_Korea ' s nuclear program is the only bargaining tool he has . He ' ll use it as a tool. &quot; During the wide-ranging interview in Los Angeles , Choi and Shin provided a close-up view of the reclusive North_Korean leader about whom little is known outside his secretive nation , where a personality cult grew around Kim Il Sung that is equivalent_to a state religion . The couple escaped_from their North_Korean captors in 1986 and settled two years later in the Los Angeles area , living now in Beverly Hills . They became U.S. citizens last year and are working_on an epic film , &quot; Genghis Khan , &quot; which they began in North_Korea . Their joint memoirs , published in 1988 in Korean and Japanese , sold 300 # 000 copies in Japan alone . The fact that they related their experiences , filling 863 pages , is one reason they do not feel a need merely to demonize their onetime captor , they say ; getting_on in years , they feel there ' s little time left to dwell_on the unpleasant past . What ' s more , like millions of other Koreans of their generation , having lived through brutal Japanese colonial rule , World_War_II , the Korean_War and decades of dictatorship , they are numb -- and practiced in a survival technique of forgive and forget . In this spirit , the couple see their kidnapings as examples of Kim ' s well-planned moves to achieve what he believed was good for his country . As a movie buff who recognized the power of the medium , his dream was to create a first-class movie_industry in his country . To achieve that , he plotted to abduct them . Since Korea was partitioned at the end of World_War_II , the Communist regime in the North has abducted countless artists , musicians and writers , including this century ' s most famous novelist , Lee Kwang Soo , in an attempt to deplete the South ' s intellectual roster . &quot; If you measure Kim Jong Il with Western standards of freedom and human_rights , he is irrational , &quot; said Shin . &quot; On the other hand , if you analyze him in the context of Stalinism , he is not crazy. &quot; &quot; The end justifies the means . Wasn ' t it Lenin who said it was all_right to steal for the sake of the revolution ? &quot; said Choi . From their intimate encounters with him , Choi and Shin are convinced that Kim has the ability to assume and retain power over North_Korea . &quot; The so-called North_Korean specialists don ' t know anything , &quot; Shin said . &quot; They ' ve never met the man. &quot; Referring to &quot; experts &quot; who have speculated that Kim may_not survive beyond the next two years because he doesn ' t have his father ' s credentials and charisma , Shin said : &quot; If Kim Jong Il goes , so go all_the people around him . Do you think they will let that happen ? Kim Il Sung didn ' t groom him to be his heir just because he was his son . Kim Il Sung chose him because he knew he was capable. &quot; The younger Kim has been running day-to-day operations of the Pyongyang government for the past 20 years , said Shin , an assessment shared by numerous North_Korea watchers in South_Korea . During the movie couple ' s eight years in Pyongyang , they dined with Kim , watched movies with him and visited his home -- considered a rare privilege . They spent scores of hours discussing movie projects , which Kim considered a key to mobilizing his people ' s support . Their bizarre odyssey began when Choi , South_Korea ' s most popular actress since World_War_II , was kidnaped in Hong Kong in January , 1978 , in Repulse Bay . Out of nowhere , several men appeared , picked Choi up and put her on a freighter -- sobbing , screaming and then fainting -- to the North_Korean port of Nampo near Pyongyang , she wrote in her memoir . Several days later , Choi was met at the dock by Kim Jong Il , whose welcoming remarks were : &quot; You have suffered a great_deal trying to come here . I am Kim Jong Il. &quot; She was driven to one of his villas . For many months , she locked herself in the bathroom and cried . Often she ran the faucet full blast to keep her guards from hearing her , and called_out the names of her two adopted children and other family members . Sometimes she felt_like she would go crazy , she recalled . Shin was abducted six months later , after mounting a fruitless search for Choi . He , too , was lured to Repulse Bay , bound and anesthetized and taken by different boats to Nampo , Shin said . For five years Choi and Shin did not know whether the other was alive or in North_Korea . They were held captive separately until they were reunited on March 6 , 1983 , at a banquet hosted by Kim at Communist_Party headquarters in Pyongyang . Choi was moved from villa to villa , subjected_to indoctrination and constantly under watch . Shin was held_in a political prison for four years , after he twice tried to escape in a Mercedes-Benz . After the pair were reunited , they plotted their getaway . The only way_out was to cooperate with Kim , they said . On Oct . 18 , 1983 , Kim hosted a 57th birthday_party for Shin . That night Kim asked Shin to be his special adviser on motion_pictures . Kim asked Shin to forgive their &quot; recent difficulties &quot; and admitted his involvement in the kidnapings . Kim told Shin he wanted to export movies to improve his country ' s image . That very night Shin Film Inc. was created , and two days later the movie couple were off to Eastern Europe with diplomatic passports and $ 3 million to make a movie Kim Jong Il wanted completed for his father ' s birthday , six months later . Kim Jong Il ' s 15 # 000 movies , one of the world ' s largest private collections , included all_of Shin ' s films -- more_than 100 in all . &quot; Kim Jong Il liked both of us -- long before he met us , &quot; Shin said . &quot; So did Kim Il Sung . Now , having won Kim Jong Il ' s confidence , the two were permitted to travel , even to Western Europe , though they were always accompanied by North_Korean officials . While in Europe , they even held a news_conference and said they had gone_to the North voluntarily , though South_Korean officials dismissed that as another North_Korean propaganda ploy . The couple made half_a_dozen films for North_Korea . Their &quot; One-Way Mission &quot; won the best-director award at a 1985 film festival in Czechoslovakia . A pleased Kim Jong Il called Choi . &quot; Our country has never won an honor like this , &quot; he said . In January , 1986 , they were in Vienna on the way to Budapest , where they were to begin work_on a film about Genghis Khan . Choi and Shin , helped by a Japanese journalist they knew , made a daring escape in a taxi , eluding their guards , who were in hot pursuit . They dashed into the U.S. Embassy and sought refuge . For two years after that they lived_in a Washington , D.C. , suburb , under the protection of U.S. officials until 1988 . A furious Kim Jong Il had placed a $ 1-million bounty on them . During their stay in Pyongyang , they led a &quot; privileged &quot; life , they acknowledged , even during their confinement . Kim made_sure his aides remembered their birthdays and had appropriate gifts delivered to them . And whenever Kim called Choi on a special hot-line telephone he had set_up to talk to her , he was solicitous , always inquiring about her well-being . Speaking in Korean throughout the interview , but occasionally using English words such_as &quot; scenario &quot; and &quot; productions , &quot; both Choi and Shin said images of North_Korea in the West are distorted , showing the extremes . They attributed this to the tendency of Westerners to focus_on what is said as opposed to what is left unsaid . &quot; For example , all these reports about Kim Jong Il ' s sexual proclivities and eccentricities are exaggerated , &quot; said Shin . &quot; I don ' t think Kim Jong Il womanizes any more_than other powerful men in the world who can have women at their beck and call , &quot; he said . Shin said he was impressed by Kim ' s patience in achieving his projects . &quot; He spent five years trying to win me over to his side to make movies , &quot; Shin said . Physically , the primary thing Choi remembers about Kim Jong Il is his &quot; roundness. &quot; &quot; He has a round face , his eyes are round and big , and he is rotund. &quot; Kim also had a good_sense of humor and laughed easily , she said . Sometimes he told self-deprecating jokes about his appearance , too . Once , when Kim visited Choi , he stood at the entrance and as soon as he saw her asked : &quot; How do I look ? &quot; When she hesitated , he grinned and said : &quot; I look nanjaenggi ttong-jjaru , &quot; meaning a small sack of excrement , one of the more earthy Korean jokes . In a sign of respect , Kim addressed them as sunsaeng ( teacher ) . They , in turn , called him &quot; dear leader &quot; or &quot; comrade leader. &quot; After the couple won the best director award , Kim called Choi . The actress , who was working in their studio when Kim phoned , recorded the conversation , a copy of which was made available to The Times . The conversation was preserved on one of seven tapes they packed in their luggage when they left North_Korea for the last time . In a 10-minute conversation , laced with laughter and jokes , Kim accused her and her husband of ignoring him . &quot; Dear leader , it is I who should say that you have all but forgotten us . We hadn ' t heard from you for so_long , we thought we were vanished from your universe. &quot; &quot; Not I , teacher Choi , &quot; he said , laughing . &quot; You are the ones who have forgotten me . Lately , you don ' t want to have anything to do with me. &quot; He inquired about her health , then suggested that she take some time_off to conserve her energy . Kim asked about Shin , who was making a movie in Beijing at the time , and invited them to join him for dinner as soon as he returned . &quot; Half of the time , our phone conversations with Kim Jong Il were taken_up with jokes , &quot; said Shin , who too had a hot_line to Kim Jong Il during his separate confinement . One time , as Choi sat in her quarters wallowing in sadness and thinking_of her children and relatives back home , the phone rang . It was Kim . &quot; Teacher Choi , it is I , Kim Jong Il . What are you doing right now ? &quot; &quot; I was reading earlier , but I ' m knitting just now , &quot; Choi said . &quot; I ' ll be sending a car within the hour . Please come_to our home. &quot; His voice was cheerful and , Choi thought , slightly tipsy . &quot; Thank you so_much for the invitation , but what ' s the occasion ? &quot; &quot; To tell you the truth , today is my birthday . We haven ' t prepared anything special , but we ' re having a family get-together . Why don ' t you come , teacher Choi. &quot; She chose a cobalt_blue traditional Korean dress , made from fabric Kim had given her . The car he sent_for her sped across the bridge_over the River Taedong , toward the eastern section of Pyongyang , past rows of poplar_trees , and finally stopped in front of an unpretentious one-story house . Kim was at the entrance when she arrived . He introduced her to his wife , a handsome woman who surprised her , Choi said , by wearing a long Western dress instead of the traditional Korean attire most women in North_Korea wore . &quot; Teacher Choi , &quot; Kim said , &quot; my wife is just a simple homemaker . Isn ' t that what women should do -- stay home and raise children ? &quot; She also met his son . He was chubby like his father . Choi asked him how old he was . He responded &quot; eight. &quot; But when she asked what his name was , the boy complained , &quot; Why do you want to know my name ? &quot; Stroking the boy ' s head , Kim Jong Il said gently : &quot; When adults ask children questions , children are supposed to answer. &quot; As if to assuage the awkward situation , a young_man , who appeared to be the boy ' s tutor , arrived and led the child to play outside . Afterward , she realized the faux_pas she had committed . &quot; Who in North_Korea would dare ask the name of the grandson of their Great Leader ? &quot; she asked herself . But Kim was in a jovial mood that afternoon . He walked_around his spacious living_room with a video camera , capturing the party . Afterward , he played the video for everyone . The picture came_out blurry and pink . Everyone laughed about that , including Kim . The motion_picture couple said they believe Kim would have made a fine movie producer because of his enormous dedication and meticulousness . &quot; We nicknamed him ' micro-manager , ' &quot; Choi said . &quot; He pays_attention to everything . He keeps track of everything . He is simply amazing. &quot; Soon after her capture , Kim had his aides deliver a score of boxes to her door . They contained materials for every type of clothing -- from party wear to casual wear . Choi had only two pieces of clothing in her shopping_bag when she was kidnaped . Just as he carefully picked gifts for his captives and planned for the enhancement of North_Korea ' s film_industry , they believe , Kim Jong Il can manage his government . The couple advised : &quot; Don ' t underestimate Kim Jong Il. &quot;</TEXT>
