   <HEADLINE> POLITICS COLOR SHOWDOWN ON GAMING PANEL ; LEGISLATURE : A RE-VOTE ON THE BILL TO CREATE A GAMBLING COMMISSION WILL TEST LAWMAKERS ' LOYALTY TO WILLIE BROWN , WHO OPPOSES STATE LICENSING AS UNNECESSARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Concerned about the potential of organized_crime infiltrating California ' s card rooms , the Legislature is debating whether to establish a state gambling commission , which would license and regulate the popular and lucrative clubs . Sponsored by Republican Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren and Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg ( D-Sacramento ) , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , the bill creating the commission was approved by a 49-10 vote_in the Assembly late last month . But it was prevented from moving to the state Senate by opponents -- led by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( D-San Francisco ) -- who used a parliamentary maneuver to stall the measure . Brown says the legislation ( AB 2803 ) is &quot; untimely and unnecessary &quot; and would make Lungren &quot; the gambling czar of California. &quot; As proposed , the attorney_general ' s office would conduct thorough criminal background checks on card club license applicants and make license recommendations to the seven-member commission , whose members would be appointed by the governor , the Assembly Speaker and the Senate Rules Committee . Currently , both state and local entities make background checks , but the bill ' s supporters say such checks are limited in scope and not coordinated with other law_enforcement agencies . &quot; The need for the commission is self-evident , &quot; Lungren said in an interview . &quot; You have $ 7.5 billion estimated to be wagered across card room tables yearly in California . When you have a vacuum of appropriate oversight , you create a tremendous opportunity for organized_crime to move_in with the enormous amounts of cash involved . This is preventive medicine. &quot; Lungren discounted Brown ' s criticism , saying : &quot; Far from me trying to become the gambling czar of California , I ' m trying to set_up a commission to do that job . Willie knows that . So Willie is just plain wrong. &quot; An undercurrent in the debate over the gambling commission is the political animosity between Lungren and Brown , who have been at_odds at least since 1988 . That was when Brown voted against Lungren ' s confirmation as state_treasurer . Lungren , then a former Republican congressman from Long_Beach , was appointed to the post by then-Republican Gov . George Deukmejian as a replacement for the late Jesse M . Unruh . Although he was confirmed by a 43-32 Assembly vote , Lungren was rejected by the Senate . The state Supreme Court ultimately ruled that he could not be treasurer with the approval of only one house , which temporarily sidetracked Lungren ' s political career . The gambling commission bill , supported by Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and various law_enforcement groups , is one of the most heavily lobbied bills of the 1994 session . Big and small card clubs , Las Vegas gambling interests , horse_racing tracks , labor_unions and Indian tribes who run bingo and casino-style games , all with a substantial interest in legalized gambling , have hired a raft of well-connected and expensive lobbyists to work the bill . For example , former Assembly Republican floor_leader Bob Naylor of Redwood City represents Las Vegas gambling interests ; Rod Blonien , former top aide to Deukmejian , represents the California Commerce Casino in the city of Commerce ; and Sacramento City Councilman Jose Pane represents several Indian tribes . Former Democratic Assemblyman Richard Floyd of Carson is working for the small card clubs ; Terrance Flanigan , another former Deukmejian aide , represents Southern California card club owner George Hardie , who operates the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens ; former Republican Assemblywoman Bev Hansen of Santa Rosa speaks_for Hollywood Park , and former Republican state Sen . Dennis Carpenter is representing several card clubs . In general , most of the large card clubs favor the bill , while most of the smaller ones are against it . There are about 265 card clubs in California , with the Bicycle Club reporting a record-high $ 97 million in gross_revenues in 1992 , the last year for which figures are available . The potential to reap enormous profits has prompted other groups to propose new , large card rooms , according to an attorney_general ' s report earlier this year . As of last February , seven large card clubs were under various stages of development , while 27 more were being proposed in various regions of the state . A new card room at Hollywood Park opened July 1 with 150 tables . During the Assembly debate , Isenberg , a former Brown aide , warned his colleagues it would be wise_to move as soon as possible to set_up the watchdog gambling commission before a scandal occurs . Isenberg said the state of Nevada spent 30 years working to wipe_out the infiltration of organized_crime into its casinos . &quot; I don ' t like gambling , &quot; Isenberg said , &quot; but if it ' s going_to be here , it ought to be honest , even and aboveboard . We should make_sure gambling is at least free from the criminal element. &quot; Brown , though , says the issue hasn ' t been studied enough . He wants the Assembly to wait for Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr . ( D-Inglewood ) , chairman of the Governmental Organization Committee and considered to be a gambling legislation expert , to look_into the issue and come_up with recommendations . Ironically , Tucker , who said Isenberg had a good bill , voted for it . Opponents of the measure then served notice they would seek reconsideration of the vote , which has blocked the bill from moving to the Senate . Both the Assembly and Senate are scheduled to return here Aug . 8 after a monthlong summer vacation recess , and the gambling issue is expected to come_up again after that . A legislative summation of Isenberg ' s measure says its intent is &quot; to provide uniform , minimum standards of regulation . . . ( and ) to insure that gambling is free from criminal elements and is conducted honestly and competitively. &quot; The gambling commission would have three members appointed by the governor , two by the Assembly Speaker and two by the Senate Rules Committee . Its main responsibility would be to issue card club licenses , currently left mainly to local_government . The commission also would be empowered to revoke licenses . Any applicant found to have a background in organized_crime or a felony conviction involving dishonesty or moral turpitude within 10 years would be prohibited from obtaining a license . Cities and counties , which currently issue licenses and have operating jurisdiction over card clubs , would continue to control locations , hours of operation , number of tables , wagering limits and other requirements . Although the bill applies only to card room licensing , the measure could be expanded to cover other casino-type gambling . Floyd , the former Democratic Assemblyman who represents the small card clubs , charges that Lungren is using the theme of preventing organized crime in the card room industry as an issue he can use in running_for governor in 1998 . &quot; He ' s running_for governor on it right now , &quot; Floyd said . &quot; He ' ll get huge campaign contributions from Las Vegas gambling interests , and he ' ll let them come here and run the small clubs out of business. &quot; Responded Lungren : &quot; Being criticized by the former assemblyman on the question of ethics is like being accused of giving a mad dog rabies when he bites you . that ' s ridiculous. &quot; Approval of the gambling commission bill by a 49-10 bipartisan vote June 29 was unusual because Brown rarely loses on bills he doesn ' t like . Adding spice to the political equation is that Isenberg is usually a member of Brown ' s inner_circle on politically sensitive issues . Twenty-one Democrats defied the Speaker and voted yes . So did 28 Republicans . Only seven Democrats , including Brown , voted no . It ' s now up_to Brown to find nine yes votes and persuade them to switch . If he can , Isenberg ' s bill will fail .</TEXT>
