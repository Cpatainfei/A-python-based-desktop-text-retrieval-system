   <HEADLINE> GLINT OF PEACE BLOSSOMS IN TROPICAL BOUGAINVILLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Guerrillas opened_fire from all sides at a truck crammed with refugees and soldiers speeding along a jungle highway on Bougainville island . They killed 17 , including a 6-year-old girl and her mother , and wounded 26 . A soldier bled to death as the rebels fled and his comrades radioed for help . The ambush in March was typical of a civil_war that has taken 500 lives in five years on the lush tropical island 600 miles northeast of Port Moresby . Finally , both sides are realizing neither can win and are moving toward peace talks . &quot; The possibility of a military solution being imposed . . . is nil , &quot; said Stephen Loosely , an Australian lawmaker who led a fact-finding delegation to Bougainville . &quot; Secession cannot be won through military means. &quot; Fighting began in 1989 after a long dispute between traditional landowners and an Australian company that ran a copper_mine , then the world ' s largest , near the town of Panguna . The national economy has survived because of new mineral projects elsewhere , but Bougainville ' s future looks bleak if the war continues . Foreign aid agencies estimate that thousands of civilians , many of them children and old people , have died of malnutrition and disease . A government blockade intended to stop smuggled arms also has reduced shipments of food and medicine . About 50 # 000 residents have fled their homes to government-run camps , known euphemistically as &quot; care centers. &quot; Dozens of villages and the provincial_capital , Arawa , are in ruins . Prime_Minister Paias Wingti acknowledges serious lapses of discipline by the military , but says claims of human_rights abuses are exaggerated by &quot; ignorant international do-gooders. &quot; He insists that most Bougainvilleans support the government and are being terrorized by the rebels . Peace talks have failed twice , but there are optimistic signs this time . &quot; We will continue to search for various peaceful ways to quickly resolve this crisis , &quot; said Wingti , who has previously demanded unconditional surrender . The rebels also are sounding conciliatory . &quot; Somewhere . . . there ' s a shared middle ground , &quot; spokesman Mike Forster told the Sydney Morning Herald .</TEXT>
