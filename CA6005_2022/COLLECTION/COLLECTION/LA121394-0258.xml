   <HEADLINE> INCLUDE TAX STRATEGY IN HOLIDAY WEDDING PLANS ; FINANCE : IT ' S NOT A JOLLY SUBJECT , BUT SOME SMART PREPARATIONS BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR MAY SPARE YOU UNPLEASANT SURPRISES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How romantic to be married under the mistletoe or to have a wedding toast on New Year ' s Eve -- just don ' t expect a honeymoon from the Internal Revenue Service . &quot; If you ' re considering getting_married during the holidays and both of you work , you might want to postpone it until January to avoid the marriage penalty , &quot; said Larry Scheinfeld , a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick . &quot; Marital status is determined on the last_day of the year. &quot; And so is your tax_bill . Although the deadline for filing ' 94 returns is months away , the chance to reduce what you pay the IRS is drawing to a close . There are still plenty of ways to lower your tax_liability before year ' s end , like increasing charitable contributions , deferring annual bonuses , even putting_off a wedding to avoid the so-called marriage penalty . ( that ' s a quirk in the system that frequently requires people to pay more taxes when they ' re married than when they ' re single. ) &quot; There ' s really lots of things that can be done , &quot; said Nancy Anderson , manager of special tax projects for H &amp; R Block Inc. in Kansas City , Mo . Anderson suggests preparing a rough return now to determine what course of action can be taken . A good accountant or tax publication can also help . &quot; The first thing you need to look_at is what your situation for ' 94 is as of today , &quot; added Andrea Markezin , a principal for Ernst &amp; Young , which offers tax-saving tips through its &quot; Tax Saving Strategies Guide , 1995. &quot; &quot; That means looking_at your pay stub and projecting how much compensation and withholding you will have for the whole year . . . ( and ) estimating interest and dividend income by looking_at your bank_statement . &quot; Get a feel_for what your baseline is before making any changes. &quot; It ' s especially important to ensure that your estimated tax payments or withholding are correct . To avoid penalties , you must withhold through payroll deductions or quarterly estimated payments an amount at least equal_to 90 % of this year ' s projected federal income-tax liability or 100 % of last year ' s actual liability , whichever is less . If your adjusted gross income exceeds $ 150 # 000 a year , it ' s 90 % of this year ' s liability or 110 % of last year ' s . Timing is essential . The rule_of_thumb among tax experts is to defer income and accelerate deductions . While you can ' t defer salary that is already earned or available to you , you can have expected year-end bonuses , free-lance or consulting fees paid_out in 1995 , thereby delaying tax payments on them , Scheinfeld said . At the same time , Scheinfeld noted , you shouldn ' t overlook available tax_shelters like company-sponsored 401 ( K ) plans or Keough plans for the self-employed . Tax is deferred on the portion of your salary put into the plans . Income from investments must also be considered since it ' s taxable in the year earned , regardless of whether you reinvest it . However , investments that generate long-term capital_gains won ' t be subject_to taxation until they ' re sold , tax experts note . The maximum rate is 28 % . Tax experts suggest taking some capital_losses this year to offset any gains you might have . Scheinfeld , however , thinks individuals should hold_off on selling appreciated stock or other investments that may incur capital_gains until next year . &quot; There ' s talk_of cutting the tax ( rate ) to 14 % . That may happen with a Republican Congress , &quot; he said . There are many ways to accelerate deductions , meanwhile . &quot; If you have real_estate taxes due in January , you can pay them in December , &quot; Markezin said . &quot; You can also make your January mortgage payment in December . . . to get the extra interest deduction. &quot; Planned charitable contributions also should be made before Dec . 31 . You may even consider giving a portion of your 1995 contributions this year . ( Just remember to get a written receipt if your gift to one organization exceeds $ 250 ; canceled checks won ' t suffice as proof. ) It ' s not too early to think_about your filing status , either . A divorced mother would probably owe less taxes if she files as a head of the household rather than a single person . A two-income couple might fare better filing separate returns rather than jointly . Then maybe they can go_ahead with their wedding plans .</TEXT>
