   <TEXT> Even now , with its Italian chef &quot; Guido &quot; on the lam , the popular Magica Roma restaurant hardly seems to be a hotbed of international intrigue . Diners come and go at a leisurely pace , and the cozy eatery is still the best place in town for pasta . Never mind that Guido was a veteran of the Red Brigade terrorist organization and a fugitive wanted in the 1978 murder of former Italian Prime_Minister Aldo Moro . Guido has taken a break from his guise as successful restaurateur and is in hiding . But his exposure late last year unleashed a scandal still reverberating in a Nicaragua that grapples daily with its polarizing past of revolution , counterrevolution and war . From radical leftists and terrorists to starry-eyed pacifists , thousands of people from all_over the world descended on Nicaragua during the 1980s , the decade of Sandinista rule . The idealists believed that they were joining a revolutionary experiment . The international fugitives were seeking a haven where Sandinista authorities , themselves embroiled in battle with U.S.-backed Contra rebels , shared tips on urban warfare and supplied jobs , homes and new identities . Many of the revolutionaries joined in the fight against the Contras , and many obtained Nicaraguan citizenship . But after a series of embarrassing incidents that revealed the presence of people like Guido , the center-right government that vanquished the Sandinista regime at the polls is trying to figure_out how to crack_down on unwanted foreigners and root_out the revolutionaries . Sandinistas say the campaign by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to cancel foreigners ' citizenship and deport suspected terrorists is a witch hunt aimed at pleasing other governments , which in turn will give aid . Chamorro , worried about her government ' s image in post-Sandinista Nicaragua , says it must safeguard its own national security by ridding the country of violent criminals . The foreigners themselves have mixed reactions . Some , such_as Guido , vow to fight any effort to deport them . Others are fed up with the whole mess , disenchanted with the current politics of Nicaragua and plan to leave , finally forced to recognize the end of an era . &quot; People feel_like they ' re in limbo , &quot; said Moises Arana Cantero , a former Sandinista diplomat in Spain who organized a support group for the foreigners . &quot; There ' s a certain amount of anxiety . People don ' t know quite what to do. &quot; The controversy is one of many tests the Chamorro government has faced as it tries to exert authority over the Sandinistas , whose influence and legacy remain powerful long after their formal role in government ended . When Sandinista President Daniel Ortega lost -- unexpectedly -- to Chamorro in 1990 elections , many of the radicals who had enjoyed Sandinista protection hoped that they could continue to live_in Nicaragua , confident of their Sandinista-supplied covers and unwilling to face the law in their home countries . In the weeks after the election but before Chamorro assumed office , Sandinista authorities hurriedly granted citizenship to 990 foreign nationals , including 92 Spaniards , 56 Jordanians , 20 Palestinians , 94 Guatemalans and 510 Salvadorans , according to government records . Many of those who had used Sandinista Nicaragua as a sanctuary worked directly for the Interior Ministry run_by intelligence czar Tomas Borge . The foreign radicals exchanged weapons training and used Nicaragua as a base of operations , running spy networks and plotting guerrilla missions , according to former Sandinista officials . &quot; It was a beautiful time , &quot; said Sergio Buschmann , a Chilean arms smuggler and drama teacher who lived_in Nicaragua sporadically after March , 1980 . &quot; In the morning we ' d film a TV_program . . . and in the afternoon we ' d have militia training. &quot; Buschmann , 51 , has been living_in Managua as the Chilean government tries , for the fifth time , to extradite him for his role in what he claims was the largest arms-smuggling operation by Latin_American revolutionaries . The guns and rocket_launchers , Buschmann says with pride , were used in a 1986 assassination attempt on Gen . Augusto Pinochet , the dictator who ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990 . Pinochet was unharmed , but five of his bodyguards were killed . A founding member of Chile ' s Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front guerrilla movement , Buschmann also spent considerable time in Chilean prisons during the 1970s and ' 80s , having been captured during his clandestine sabotage missions . In Nicaragua , he worked with the Sandinista Culture Ministry , gave acting classes and formed a theater troupe with Salvadoran guerrillas that toured Europe . And he joined the Sandinista People ' s Army fighting the Contra rebels in the early 1980s . Because of the changed climate in Nicaragua , Buschmann believes that the Chamorro government may honor Chile ' s extradition request this time . Hoping to preempt such action , Buschmann returned to Chile this month to face the charges against him . He was immediately arrested in Santiago . Los Angeles human_rights attorney Peter Schey is helping with the case . The web of safety that Sandinista protection gave the revolutionaries and radicals first began to unravel with a mysterious explosion at a clandestine arms dump in Managua last May . The weapons were being stockpiled by Salvadoran rebels , in violation of 1992 peace accords that ended the Salvadoran civil_war , and kept underneath an auto repair_shop owned by a Basque who allegedly belonged_to the Basque separatist group ETA . The Basque had obtained Nicaraguan citizenship in 1990 using the name Miguel Antonio Larios . He disappeared after the explosion , although news_reports last month quoted Interpol as having spotted him in Brazil . The scandal around the explosion widened dramatically in the months that followed . Not only had it exposed the illegal hoarding of weapons , but officials discovered along with the guns and antiaircraft missiles documents proving the existence of a vast kidnaping and forgery ring involving leftists from Europe , the Mideast and all_of Latin_America . Once again , the Sandinista legacy had come_back to haunt the Chamorro government . International condemnation was mighty , and the U.S. Congress suspended millions of dollars in aid , accusing Chamorro of failing to rein_in Sandinista intelligence_operations and of harboring criminals . To counter the attacks , Chamorro swiftly rounded up and deported three alleged ETA terrorists who had lived_in Nicaragua for years . The men were dispatched to Spain , where they originally were to face a_battery of murder_charges . Recent reports from Spain , however , indicated that two have been released for lack of evidence . The Chamorro government , which itself employs a number of former Contras , then ordered all 990 people who obtained citizenship in the waning days of the Sandinista regime to report to the Interior Ministry with documents to prove their legal_status and background . Fewer than 100 naturalized citizens bothered to appear , but the passions of Nicaragua ' s still-polarized society had been ignited . Sandinista militants rallied in protest . They accused the government of capitulating to foreign pressure . They burned Interior Minister Alfredo Mendieta in effigy and marched outside the Spanish Embassy . Arana Cantero and others formed the Dignity and National Sovereignty Movement , a Sandinista support group for the foreigners , arguing that the human and civil_rights of naturalized citizens were being violated . &quot; It was a campaign of political persecution , with a touch of xenophobia , &quot; said Evelyn Palma , an attorney with a Sandinista human_rights organization . &quot; These are people associated with the Sandinista Front , identified with the revolution , and for that reason the government labels them ' terrorists. ' &quot; Some , like Guatemalan guerrillas , cannot go_home because their native countries are still at war . Others have established roots in Nicaragua , marrying Nicaraguans and raising families . Amid the furor , the heat was turned_up on Guido , the Magica Roma restaurateur whose real name is Alessio Casimirri . Italian newspapers delving anew into the Moro case discovered and reported his whereabouts late last year , and the shadowy chef has been lying_low ever since . Casimirri , through an intermediary , refused to be interviewed for this story -- unless he was paid . But he told the Sandinista newspaper Barricada that he had no intention of leaving Nicaragua . &quot; A lot of people would like me to go , but I am Nicaraguan and I have every right to be in this country , &quot; he said from his hide-out , speaking what Barricada called an Italian-accented Spanish sprinkled with Nicaraguan slang . Casimirri opened the Magica Roma restaurant last year . Under his gregarious management , the restaurant quickly became all_the rage , frequented by Managua ' s elite and members of the international community . An Italian diplomat was so fond of the place his family used it for a wedding_reception . Those who knew Casimirri ' s background didn ' t care ; others never suspected . In the Barricada interview , Casimirri claimed that the Italian government knew for some time that he lived_in Managua and only began to pursue him recently for domestic political reasons aimed at discrediting Italy ' s former Communists . Italian courts have sentenced Casimirri in absentia to several life terms . His partner at the restaurant , Manlio Grillo , is another reputed Red Brigade member wanted in a bombing that killed two children . Grillo can still be found at the restaurant most nights . According to a former Sandinista intelligence_officer who handled many of the foreign cases , Casimirri first arrived in Nicaragua , from Libya , in 1983 . He obtained Nicaraguan citizenship in 1988 using the name Guido di Giambattista . Rene Vivas , deputy interior minister in the Sandinista government and former police_chief in the Chamorro government , signed the order . Casimirri married a Nicaraguan , Raquel Garcia , and they have two children . Mendieta canceled his citizenship , but an appellate_court recently stayed the order . Sandinista militants defend the protection they gave radicals . &quot; The terrorist thing is very relative , &quot; said Sandinista political_science professor Silvio Prado . &quot; Yitzhak Rabin directed a terrorist commando unit before Israel became a state , and now he is a chief_of_state . Don ' t forget that in the ' 70s , the armed struggle was an option for many people . Who is to determine which terrorism is good and which terrorism is bad ? &quot; U.S. officials do not share that ambivalence , pointing_out that the actions of terrorist groups such_as the Red Brigades and ETA have claimed many innocent victims . &quot; The Sandinista Front , feeling itself under_attack , felt they had the right to defend themselves with many sorts of actions which perhaps in the past could be justified according to their opinion , &quot; said Chamorro ' s chief adviser , Antonio Lacayo . &quot; The problem is , today that is over. &quot; One flaw in the government ' s efforts , say critics , is that all foreigners who sought_out Nicaragua ' s revolution end_up getting painted with the same &quot; terrorist &quot; brush . In addition to the radical leftists , there were pacifists , social_workers and doctors for whom Sandinista Nicaragua seemed a romantic challenge , a chance to participate in a society trying to remake itself . Barbara Stewart , a Canadian specialist in library_science , moved to Nicaragua in 1983 , attracted by the excitement of potential social change . Instead , she witnessed a country go_to_war , then enter a peace that it seems unable to reconcile with the past . Stewart , 43 , spent the last 11 years setting_up databases for think_tanks and other organizations and teaching computer skills . She became a citizen in 1990 and is among those whose status the government is questioning . While she does not feel threatened by the government ' s campaign , Stewart opposes it because it ignores due_process and the norms of international_law . &quot; I ' m not a terrorist , I ' m not a criminal , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve done everything to contribute to my field in Nicaragua . I work seven days a week . If someone wants to attack me as someone who doesn ' t deserve ( citizenship ) , well , I ' m very defensible . Many others are not. &quot; Still , Stewart has decided to sell her house and leave for Los Angeles , where she plans to work_at a university library . It is not just the harassment and constant uncertainty that have taken their toll . Like many who were once true believers , Stewart has become disenchanted with the Sandinista Front and generally discouraged about Nicaragua ' s future . &quot; I have no hope for Nicaragua , &quot; she said . &quot; that ' s why I ' m leaving. &quot;</TEXT>
