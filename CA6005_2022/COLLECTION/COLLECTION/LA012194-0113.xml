   <HEADLINE> NIXON OPENS POLICY RESEARCH_CENTER ; POLITICS : THINK_TANK HEADQUARTERED AT PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY WILL FOCUS_ON CONTEMPORARY_WORLD ISSUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former President Richard Nixon joined his onetime White_House colleagues Thursday to recall the achievements of the Nixon Administration and to launch a new policy research_center that they hope will continue the work they started 25 years ago . In a garden ceremony held between the presidential library and the tiny white clapboard house where the 37th President was born , Nixon ' s colleagues described him as a skillful tactician who shepherded the nation through difficult times and now holds a place as a revered statesman . The speeches , including three by former secretaries_of_state and another by ex-President Gerald R . Ford , portrayed the rehabilitation of the only U.S. President to resign from office as all but complete , promising a legacy that will be shaped more by his achievements than by his role in the Watergate scandal . The Center for Peace and Freedom , a new think_tank to be headquartered at the library , will preserve Nixon ' s place in history as a key player in shaping world events and add a voice to the debate over contemporary political issues , they said . Nixon , appearing healthy and relaxed during a speech he sprinkled with humor , also reflected on the highs and lows of a public career he began in 1947 . &quot; Was it worth it ? &quot; he said . &quot; Politics is never going_to be heaven , and sometimes it ' s hell . But it was worth the trip. &quot; Even the presence of a small but loud group of protesters , another part of his legacy , was turned_into a joke . &quot; I hope you haven ' t been distressed by some of that background_noise that we ' ve had here , &quot; he said . &quot; I remind our young people out there that I ' ve been heckled by experts. &quot; Nixon , who celebrated his 81st birthday earlier this month , told the audience of about 1 # 000 invited guests that he is &quot; not a fan of think tanks. &quot; But he promised that the Center for Peace and Freedom would have a unique mission . The $ 25-million center is scheduled to open later this year with an office in Washington . Organizers hope to move_into a permanent headquarters in a new building at the library by 1997 . George L . Argyros , chairman of the fund-raising_effort dubbed Legacy of Peace , said , &quot; The center ' s goal is to ensure not only that President Nixon ' s legacy is remembered . . . but that his uniquely practical approach to the vast complexities of foreign and domestic policy continues to be applied in the uncertain new_world we face in the wake of the Cold War. &quot; But details about the project remained murky , making_it difficult to determine how much influence or attention the institute will command . Nixon ' s secretary_of_state , Henry A . Kissinger , said he would serve as an unsalaried member of the center ' s board . But no other officers of the institute were announced . At a press_conference after the ceremony , Kissinger said the center will be distinct because of its focus_on &quot; middle-term problems &quot; -- as opposed to short- or long-range issues . He said that only government can respond quickly enough for short-term problems , and traditional think_tanks usually address long-term political issues . &quot; I don ' t know of another institute that does this at the moment , &quot; he said . Kissinger said examples of middle-term problems include the evolving relationships in Eastern Europe , the Middle_East and South_Africa as well as the emerging roles of Japan and China . Literature for the center said its priority &quot; will be to have an impact on the policy-making process rather than to establish long-term niches for experts or scholars. &quot; The center plans to establish eight endowed chairs , six focusing_on foreign affairs in the Middle_East , Europe , Japan and Russia . Two others will research domestic issues . Thursday was also the 25th anniversary of Nixon ' s first inauguration as President . As a result , much of the commentary was nostalgic . At times it resembled a celebrity roast , with former Cabinet members recalling some of the most important and difficult decisions they shared_in the Nixon White_House . Afterward , Nixon gave a detailed and optimistic speech about the world ' s future . Forsaking the podium that the other speakers used , he talked without notes . &quot; Our legacy , which we have inherited from our forebears , is that we stand_for something that is unique -- the idea of freedom , &quot; he said . &quot; It is that heritage that we have that we must pass_on to others . And therefore , everything that we can do . . . to make that great idea a unifying idea we must contribute to the cause of peace and freedom in the world. &quot; Times staff writers Lily Dizon , Matt Lait , Gebe Martinez and Rebecca Trounson contributed to this report .</TEXT>
