   <HEADLINE> ' IN COLD BLOOD ' MURDERS HAUNT DEATH_PENALTY DEBATE ; KANSAS : OPPONENTS AND SUPPORTERS OF RESTORING CAPITAL_PUNISHMENT REFER FREQUENTLY TO THE CLUTTER FAMILY , MEMORIALIZED IN TRUMAN CAPOTE ' S BOOK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Almost 35 years after the Clutter family homestead became a slaughterhouse , Kansas legislators debating the death_penalty still speak movingly , almost intimately , of Herb , Bonnie , Nancy and Kenyon , the four victims no one here can forget . It was the state ' s most famous murder case , even without the notoriety brought by &quot; In Cold Blood , &quot; Truman Capote ' s &quot; nonfiction novel &quot; that was later made into a somber black-and-white movie . In making their arguments , both opponents and supporters of capital_punishment refer frequently to the Clutter murders . &quot; It ' s a point of remembrance , &quot; said state Rep . Clyde Graeber , chairman of the House committee that considers capital_punishment legislation . &quot; It ' s like a Bible , &quot; said Rep . David Heinemann , an attorney who as a teen-ager lived four miles from the Clutters ' home outside Holcomb in southwestern Kansas . &quot; We can look_at it through our own lenses and substantiate our own viewpoints. &quot; This legislative session , Kansas is closer than ever to restoring the death_penalty . Each house of the Legislature has passed its own bill , and a joint conference committee is studying the significantly different versions . Reaching a compromise is expected to take a_few weeks . Most supporters think a bill will eventually pass . Gov . Joan Finney personally opposes capital_punishment but has promised to let a bill become law without her signature . Kansas is one of 14 states without a death_penalty . Before the U.S. Supreme Court declared all death_penalty laws unconstitutional in 1972 , Kansas executed prisoners by hanging . Among those put_to_death in Kansas before 1972 were Perry Smith and Richard Hickock , the killers of wheat farmer Herb Clutter , his wife , Bonnie , their 16-year-old daughter , Nancy , and 15-year-old son , Kenyon . Hickock and Smith targeted the family farmhouse but planned only to rob the senior Clutter , who they believed kept substantial amounts of cash_in a safe . The Clutters were in fact well-off , but Herb Clutter was locally notorious for writing checks for the smallest purchases and not keeping cash on_hand . The two men entered the Clutter home before dawn Nov . 15 , 1959 ; they bound and gagged all family members , then shot each one in the head . They left with $ 40 to $ 50 in cash and Kenyon ' s transistor radio . Hickock and Smith were convicted and sentenced to hang the following spring . They spent five years on Death Row before entering &quot; The Corner , &quot; the warehouse at the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing that housed the state gallows . &quot; In Cold Blood &quot; was published in 1965 , shortly after their executions . The last inmates hanged_in Kansas were not Hickock and Smith but serial_killers James Latham and George York , who murdered seven people in five states . They walked up the 13 gallows steps June 22 , 1965 . Capote mentioned York and Latham in his book but only because they shared Death Row with Hickock and Smith . &quot; Latham and York -- their case is barely known in Kansas , &quot; Heinemann said . &quot; But everybody knows ' In Cold Blood. ' &quot; Heinemann and other opponents of capital_punishment note that Herb Clutter , a strict Methodist , was against the death_penalty . Heinemann also believes Hickock and Smith might not have killed Bonnie , Nancy and Kenyon if they didn ' t already face &quot; the big swing , &quot; as Hickock called it , for Herb ' s murder . But supporters of capital_punishment usually cite the Clutter case as the kind of heinous crime that should be punished by death . &quot; We ' d never had anything like that in our area , &quot; said Clifford Hope Jr. , the attorney who handled the Clutter estate . Kansas has never been comfortable with capital_punishment . The Legislature repealed the state ' s first death_penalty law in 1907 ; no inmate had been hanged_in the preceding 37 years . The state returned to the death_penalty as punishment for first-degree murder in 1935 . Gov . Alf Landon noted at the time that criminals had robbed or tried to rob 87 banks in the previous two years . &quot; The most potent means of discouraging crime is speedy and certain punishment , &quot; Landon said . Opponents in 1935 sounded the same arguments still ringing in the Legislature almost 60 years later . &quot; We are lowering the standard of civilization ; we are tarnishing the good name of Kansas , and this bill cannot and will not accomplish its purpose , &quot; state Sen . Joseph McDonald said . The state waited nine years for its next execution . From 1944 to 1965 it executed 15 people . But since 1976 , when the Supreme Court allowed states to start executions again , Kansas has enacted no new death_penalty . Democratic Gov . John Carlin vetoed bills in 1979 , 1980 , 1981 and 1985 . His successor , Republican Mike Hayden , made reinstating capital_punishment a priority , but the Senate rejected bills in 1987 and 1989 . The House rejected a death_penalty proposal in 1992 .</TEXT>
