   <HEADLINE> GREENSPAN DEFENDS FED INTEREST_RATE HIKES ; POLICY : CENTRAL_BANK CHAIRMAN TELLS A SKEPTICAL SENATE PANEL THE MOVES WERE NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF INFLATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on Friday mounted his first public defense of the Fed ' s interest_rate increases this year , telling a skeptical Congress that the central_bank had no alternative but to hike rates to reduce the threat of inflation . Confronted with stiff criticism from leading Democratic lawmakers , Greenspan told the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that market pressures ultimately would have brought higher interest_rates even if the Fed had not acted . &quot; Delaying our actions would not have been constructive , &quot; he said . While refusing to rule_out further rate increases , Greenspan also stressed that he believes the Fed ' s actions so far should lead to solid economic_growth without rapidly rising prices . On Friday , the government said the economy grew at a 3 % pace in the first_quarter of the year , up from an earlier estimate of 2.6 % but down sharply from the 7 % level in the fourth quarter of 1993 . &quot; Overall . . . this looks_like a well-balanced economy , &quot; Greenspan said . &quot; This is looking_to me as_good_as I ' ve seen an economy evolving in a balanced form in a very long period_of_time . The economy is moving at a fairly respectable pace . . . . It could go_on for quite a long period_of_time , provided that inflationary imbalances don ' t emerge. &quot; Since February , the Fed has raised short-term interest_rates four times in a controversial effort to cool the economy before it gets so overheated that it begins to generate a surge in inflation . Fed officials are now convinced that they kept interest_rates too low for too long as the economy began to recover last year and that , before they acted in February , the economy was growing at a pace too rapid to be sustained without a run-up in prices . Greenspan noted Friday that the central_bank ' s easy-money policies of 1993 may also have led to an unhealthy increase in speculative activity in the financial markets , and he said Fed officials believed they had to raise rates to burst that bubble . Some senators , however , complained that the Fed was too concerned about appeasing the nation ' s financial markets and had moved so aggressively that its interest_rate increases are now hurting average Americans . Committee Chairman Donald W . Riegle Jr . ( D-Mich. ) urged Greenspan to pause for a time . &quot; It would be foolhardy for us to needlessly bring this economic expansion to a premature shutdown , &quot; Riegle said . Other committee_members complained that the Fed has raised rates to curb inflation at a time when there is virtually no evidence of rising prices . Sen . Paul S . Sarbanes ( D-Md. ) added that many of his constituents are upset that the Fed ' s actions have made_it impossible for them to buy homes . &quot; We ' re getting calls_in my office from people now who can ' t afford to go_through with their commitments on building new homes because they can ' t handle the monthly payments , &quot; Sarbanes said . The Fed ' s moves to raise short-term rates have had a cascading effect on other market interest_rates and the rest of the economy by making_it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow for either investments or purchases . And the lawmakers noted that the U.S. economy is now more sensitive than ever to changes in Fed interest_rate policy because so many mortgages and other consumer_loans carry adjustable rates , which can be changed relatively quickly . Sarbanes , who is also vice_chairman of the Joint Economic Committee , complained that Greenspan tightened monetary policy just after the Administration and Congress tightened fiscal_policy with last year ' s deficit-reduction agreement . He argued that , because Greenspan had urged Congress repeatedly to cut the deficit , the Fed should now reward the nation by keeping interest_rates low . Greenspan disagreed that Fed policies would sacrifice the health of the overall economy to please Wall_Street investors . Also Friday , a senior Administration official said in an interview that , while the Fed ' s actions so far have been acceptable , he is concerned that any further rate increases by the central_bank will begin to damage the economy . The Clinton_Administration so far has been careful to avoid direct criticism of the Fed ' s policies .</TEXT>
