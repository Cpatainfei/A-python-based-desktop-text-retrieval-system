   <HEADLINE> AS BIG AS ALL OUTDOORS ; TWO PALMS , TWO BARS , ONE BANDSTAND , ACRES OF TABLES UNDER UMBRELLAS . AH , PASADENA !</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Driving along Green Street toward Old Town Pasadena and Twin Palms , I knew only that the new restaurant counts Cindy and Kevin Costner and Michael Roberts , the genie behind Trumps , as three of the six partners . And that it is big . The entrance , a gap in the whitewashed wall , leads into an astonishing space , an open-air tent-restaurant as large as a village square . Dozens of white-clothed tables sit beneath the canvas sky , with six , eight , 10 wicker armchairs drawn_up around each . Candles gust in the breeze . On this night , strategically spaced heat_lamps keep it comfortable enough to eat_in the virtual outdoors . At the center , two century-old majestic palm_trees poke through the top of the tent , which retracts in fine weather . Fragrant potted plants and herbs -- flowering citrus , rosemary , thyme , mint -- are arranged at their feet . Two lively bars bracket either end of the vast space . Waiters rush by bearing bright , glazed platters . In one corner , chickens , pork_loins and rib_roasts turn_on a spit over glowing hardwood logs . In the kitchen , hearty stews and braiseddishes simmer slowly in a Texas barbecue oven adapted for the purpose . The restaurant seats 375 people , and on a recent Saturday night , the kitchen fed 698 people , 200 of them walk-ins with no reservations . Twin Palms manages to capture the feeling of village festivals in southern France or Italy , when tables are set_up in the square and the whole town turns_out to feast on grilled sausage and polenta or a grand aioli . Celebrations where the wine flows freely and the food is simple and abundant . And after , there may be music and dancing . On my first visit , the maitre d ' , wearing a topcoat that chilly evening , led us to the back , to a more traditional indoor space converted from an old stable . The two of us had a generous table for four ( there are no cramped deuces here ) . The place was_full , yet the service was warm and energetic . For starters , I ordered the brandade appetizer , wonderful salt_cod whipped into fluffy mashed potatoes and served with jaunty toasts . When is the last time you ' ve seen a $ 3 appetizer big enough to serve four ? The grand ai oli is a satisfying platter of grilled vegetables -- zucchini , carrots , deep orange squash , onions and boiled waxy potatoes with a crock of ungentrified ai oli . Both our main_courses , thick slices of nicely juicy roasted sage pork and the honey coriander duck , were definitely a deal at $ 11 and $ 13.50 respectively , with a nice potato gratin and an array of vegetables . To its credit , the menu doesn ' t have great pretensions . The cooking , much of it done on the outdoor rotisserie and grill , is truly rustic . Real food at modest prices . At Trumps , which closed_in 1992 , Roberts took his cooking right to the edge with daring combinations of ingredients and techniques . Here , he ' s gone_back to his roots with the kind of straightforward food he learned to cook in France when he was just starting_out . Contemporary restaurant fare is based largely on sauteed dishes , preparing bits of this and that to order . At Twin Palms , he ' s returned to a more 19th-Century idea : roasting joints of meat and simmering dishes slowly to develop flavor , a method that has almost disappeared from restaurant menus . Its very simplicity makes_it tricky to pull_off . Twin Palms is doing a creditable job much of the time , but it is still a restaurant in_progress . Yes , there is a grilled burger . And there is a pizza , a thin-crusted version topped with sausage , leeks and mushrooms , which makes a fine appetizer . It seems silly , however , to make anchovies optional on the pissaladie re . This thick Provencal &quot; pizza &quot; is traditionally topped with onions , olives and anchovies , the latter as essential as bacon to a BLT . The garden vegetable_soup is weak in flavor despite the dollop of pistou ( similar to Italian pesto ) stirred in at the last moment . A dense chickpea polenta was not enhanced by a smear of pungent Roquefort . The salad of duck confit with broccoli_rabe and wilted escarole sounded irresistible , but the tangle of limp ingredients didn ' t look appetizing . And , unless I ' d read it myself , I would never have recognized the stringy meat as confit , which is one of my favorite things on Earth . One night the best dish was a special of sturgeon ( a fish that actually has some taste ) in a lovely orange-saffron sauce . When you order lamb shanks , you get the whole_thing , tender as butter and served with flageolet beans . I didn ' t mind the resistant texture of the beef shank braised in red_wine but wished the beef itself had more flavor . While we savored the round , yeast-raised babas and oranges in vanilla syrup and nibbled on a sugar cone and hazelnut ice_cream , a reggae band picked_up the beat at the bandstand . One by one , the cashier at the bar , waiters , diners lingering_over their coffee , were all bobbing to the music . Several couples started dancing.And while we waited for our car , we couldn ' t resist doing a little bounce ourselves . Twin Palms has managed to translate the festive feeling of a village square to an urban , Southern California setting . With a high-profile chef at the helm and real people ' s prices ( the valet parking is more expensive than most of the appetizers ) , it ' s a new breed of restaurant . Twin Palms , 101 W . Green St . , Pasadena ; ( 818 ) 577 - 2567 . Open Monday through Saturday for lunch , daily for dinner and late night supper . Sunday brunch . Full bar . Valet parking . Major credit_cards accepted . Dinner for two , food only , $ 29- $ 63 .</TEXT>
