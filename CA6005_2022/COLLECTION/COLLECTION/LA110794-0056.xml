   <HEADLINE> DANCE REVIEWS ; O VERTIGO DANSE IN DEBT TO EUROPE FOR ' CHAMBRE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a one-act ritual of victimization , a Montreal-based ensemble named O Vertigo Danse forged a link between North_American and European modernism that proved both instructive and frustrating Friday at the Wadsworth Theater in Westwood . Danced inside an empty tiled room with high windows and skylight , Ginette Laurin ' s &quot; La Chambre Blanche &quot; invoked without ever really exploring ideas about confinement , social-versus-personal expression and gender issues . However , an invigorating dose of New World physicality helped redeem ( in part ) the piece ' s heavy debt to the most grandiose trends in Neo-Expressionist European dance-theater . With a single door leading to a shower , Stephane Roy ' s setting suggested an antique gymnasium inside a chateau , but Laurin insisted on creating some sort of self-service asylum , with 10 inmates -- dressed in either their underwear or chic black party clothes -- alternately bedeviling and consoling one another . Periodically , her dancers would look ( or stretch ) longingly toward the light or run_around and up the walls like caged animals , but most of &quot; La Chambre Blanche &quot; consisted_of showpiece dancing : intricate gymnastic duets , propulsive group playoffs contrasting male and female energy -- plus demonstrations of stylistic versatility . ( The six O Vertigo women , for instance , were obliged during the evening to dance barefoot , in heels and in pointe slippers. ) A mournful score by Michel Drapeau invited you to consider the deepest implications of the action , but the deliberately splintered continuity of the work discouraged interpretation . Indeed , &quot; La Chambre Blanche &quot; appeared so arbitrary in its development and dramatic frissons , there was no reason why it couldn ' t have lasted seven hours or seven minutes instead of 75 . Los Angeles ' own Diavolo Dance Theater offers a far more purposeful and persuasive investigation of similar themes in Jacques Heim ' s forceful &quot; Tete au Carre. &quot; But what O Vertigo has that Diavolo hasn ' t is 10 spectacular soloists . With every member of the Canadian company revealing technique and intensity to burn on Friday , &quot; La Chambre Blanche &quot; became an unwieldy but ultimately compelling divertissement . Laurin may lack the structural savvy and sense of breathtaking velocity honed by her compatriot and rival , Edouard Lock of La La La Human Steps . However , her genuine talent for adagio expression -- and the ravishing softness of her style in such passages -- repaid the closest attention . It ' s no small achievement to make beautiful movement and to inspire fine dancers to the highest standards of performance . Why compromise that accomplishment with pretensions borrowed from abroad ? Like many French-Canadians , Laurin belongs_to two cultures , two worlds -- but only one of them really nurtured her abilities on Friday . LEWIS SEGAL * O Vertigo Danse performs &quot; La Chambre Blanche &quot; Friday at 8 p.m. at California Center for the Arts , 120 W . Grand Ave. , Escondido . ( 619 ) 738-4100 . Tickets : $ 10- $ 25 .</TEXT>
