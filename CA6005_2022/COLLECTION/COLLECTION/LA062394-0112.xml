   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; TODAY ' S GAMES AT A GLANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> GROUP E at Giants Stadium , East Rutherford , N.J. Italy vs . Norway * TIME : 1 p.m. PDT * TELEVISION : ESPN and Univision . * KEY MATCHUPS : Italy will find Norway ' s defense every bit as difficult as Ireland ' s was . Using Jan Age Fjortoft as a lone striker in front of a five-man midfield gives Norway the flexibility to switch quickly from defense or offense . This transition game is one of the team ' s strengths . Norway also has a strong bench and uses its substitutes shrewdly . Italy , meanwhile , still is having trouble adapting to its new 4-3-3 alignment . Also evident in the 1-0 loss to the_Irish was the ineffectiveness of veteran defender Franco Baresi . He has apparently lost that vital step needed at the World Cup level . Giuseppe Signori , the only player Italy has these days who even resembles a striker , will be looking_for his first World Cup goal . Roberto Baggio , who was supposed to be the brightest star of the tournament , has yet to shine . It ' s now or never for the ponytailed Bhuddist , who is likely to find an avowed Christian , Norwegian sweeper Rune Bratseth , blocking his way . * OUTLOOK : With a rabid press baying for his blood and a team whose confidence has been rattled by a loss to Ireland , Italy Coach Arrigo Sacchi is a man under siege . If his team loses today , he might as well apply for permanent residence in the United States . Sacchi ' s Norwegian counterpart , Egil Olsen , has no such worries and was pictured in a newspaper recently sun-bathing on the side of the field as he watched his players practice . Norway goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt was in excellent form against Mexico and will need to match that effort in this game . * OUTCOME : The Italians have to win ; the Norwegians do not . Unlike the game against Ireland , Italy will have most of the fans on its side . The Italians will be out_to redeem themselves and should do so by a single goal . Look_for Italy to win , 1-0 or 2-1 , and for the Italian press to then predict that Italy will win the World Cup . GRAHAME L . JONES</TEXT>
