   <HEADLINE> RWANDA GOVERNMENT STRUGGLES TO GAIN CASH , CREDIBILITY ; AFRICA : THE COUNTRY IS BANKRUPT , ITS EXPORT CROPS DESTROYED . BUT AID FLOWS ONLY TO PRIVATE GROUPS AS WORLD WEIGHS WHETHER NEW LEADERS CAN BE TRUSTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the past two months , civil_servants have gone unpaid and have lived_off aid parcels from the World Food Program . The government ' s coffers are empty . At the moment , it can afford one ambassador abroad , an envoy at the United Nations . In the shabby building where the prime_minister has installed his office , the telephones don ' t work , there ' s no electricity and the water doesn ' t run . Jagged shards of broken glass litter the stairs , and in the main suite on the second floor , patches of carpet have been ripped from the floor . &quot; We are working in this ruin , &quot; Prime_Minister Faustin Twagirimungu exclaimed one morning last week to visitors , throwing_up his hands . Africa ' s newest government is one whose employees nowadays must hitch rides with foreign correspondents to conduct state business . Does any other regime face vaster challenges or problems ? Maimed by civil_war and massacres , Rwanda has lost between a half-million and 1 million people , the United Nations estimates . About 2 million other Rwandans fled into exile and are trickling back only slowly . Throughout the country , there are something like 85 # 000 orphans and abandoned children . Fifty thousand land_mines , sinister leftovers from the civil_war , dot the gorgeous , rolling landscape ; U.N. peacekeepers say only heavily traveled roads should be considered mine-free . Most of Rwanda ' s 1 # 600 primary_schools were pillaged during or after the fighting , and some were booby-trapped . War and the fastest exodus of refugees in modern times have wiped_out this year ' s coffee and tea crops , this poor landlocked African_country ' s largest earners of foreign_exchange . &quot; The situation is gloomy , &quot; Twagirimungu summed_up . &quot; No matter what happens here , we need foreign assistance in all domains. &quot; Yet , Rwanda ' s new leaders complain , rich Western countries -- including the United States -- are hanging_back and scrutinizing Rwandan officials ' actions to see if they prove to be as bloodthirsty as the people they ousted from power . For the past two months , they say , they have received no foreign_aid . &quot; It ' s a major disappointment , &quot; said Maj . Wilson Rutayisire , a government spokesman . The Rwandans say they can ' t even get their hands on the $ 200 million in assistance pledged by the World_Bank and International Monetary Fund . &quot; There is a condition , &quot; Twagirimungu pointed_out , &quot; that Rwanda must pay arrears that amount to $ 6.5 million . Where do we get the $ 6.5 million to pay the arrears ? &quot; Meanwhile , employees of the United Nations and foreign relief agencies zip through Kigali ' s streets in fleets of white Toyotas and other spanking-new cars . Working in offices powered by diesel-fueled generators , these expatriates can communicate more easily via satellite telephone and fax with their home_offices in Geneva or New York than Twagirimungu ' s subordinates can phone across town . An entire alphabet soup ' s worth of U.N. agencies and foreign charities has arrived on military transports and special charters to deal with the emergency needs of Rwandans , especially those who fled their homes . When a cholera epidemic broke_out in the squalid refugee camps across the border , in the Zairian town of Goma , some of those organizations rushed to the rescue . Now about to begin its third month in power , Twagirimungu ' s government of &quot; national unity &quot; is struggling to piece together a shattered economy and society , feeling the outside world is largely indifferent , if not suspicious . Twagirimungu and the rest of Rwanda ' s leaders are now in power because the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front ' s army routed the old government in a 3 1 / 2-month war that ended in July . &quot; Civil war , not negotiation , decided the issue , &quot; is the laconic summary one official of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda scrawled on a lecture pad in the briefing room at the U.N. peacekeepers ' headquarters . Proclaiming magnanimity in victory , the RPF implemented a power-sharing plan that had been agreed to by the rebels and the late President Juvenal Habyarimana in the northern Tanzanian city of Arusha on Aug . 3 , 1993 . A Council of Ministers was formed of people from five parties as well as two independents . Twagirimungu , 49 , a member of the Hutu ethnic majority who was a Canadian-trained university teacher and once ran a trucking_company in the western city of Cyangugu , became its head . He is not from the RPF but leads another party , the Democratic Republican Movement . Simultaneously , though , the RPF created a powerful executive not mentioned in the Arusha accord and awarded itself the presidency and vice presidency . Among the ministerial portfolios , it grabbed most of the heavyweights : defense , public_service , interior , health , transport and telecommunications , rehabilitation , women ' s affairs , youth and sports . &quot; They have really turned_around the concept of power sharing , &quot; one openly skeptical diplomat here said . In Rwanda , anyone who carries a gun as part of his government job , in the army or police , now appears to be under the control of the RPF . That is one of the reasons for the continued hesitation by many countries , including the United States , to provide badly needed support to Rwanda ' s fledgling government at_the_same_time they are lavishly doling out aid funds to help feed , resettle , educate and heal ordinary citizens . The main reservation appears to be that unless the government does much more to reassure the Hutus , the vast majority of refugees will stay in the foul camps in Zaire and Tanzania , and stability will not return to the region . For the Clinton_Administration , at least two conditions must be met before Rwanda ' s government is deemed to merit large-scale assistance . As stipulated at Arusha , the RPF ' s army must integrate officers and soldiers from the now-exiled force that it defeated , and a new National Assembly to be formed must include representatives of the former ruling party , Habyarimana ' s National Revolutionary Movement for Development , commonly known as MRND in its French-language initials . Such pressure has been persistent , if discreet . &quot; I ' ve never seem a written document , &quot; Twagirimungu said . But he and other Rwandan officials don ' t hide their outrage at demands that they adhere to an agreement that predates the war , as well as the massacres last April and May masterminded by officials of the former government and the MRND ' s youth wing , the Interahamwe . &quot; We are not going_to negotiate with killers , &quot; the prime_minister said . In the face of foreign demands that his government become more &quot; broad-based , &quot; Twagirimungu said he tried to enlist some &quot; innocent people &quot; from the old ruling party , including a former defense minister and the former ambassadors to Uganda and Canada . But they refused , he said . &quot; If people don ' t really want to serve their country , we can ' t fight , but there are millions of other Rwandans who could serve better , &quot; Twagirimungu said . Lines of authority are still being demarcated inside Rwanda ' s new leadership . But at_home as well as abroad , many people are carefully watching what sort of role Paul Kagame , 37 , the soft-voiced vice_president and defense minister , will play . A 6-foot-3 , painfully thin member of the Tutsi minority that was targeted in last spring ' s genocide , Kagame now roars through the capital in a Mercedes jeep painted camouflage green , accompanied by a military escort worthy of a head_of_state . Many believe the former guerrilla commander , who led the Rwandan Patriotic Front army to victory , is the real power behind the throne . Because of the great number of Tutsi fighters in Kagame ' s force and in the RPF , further questions are being raised abroad about whether Hutus -- 85 % of Rwanda ' s population before the massacres and mass flight -- are equitably represented in the country ' s new order . Before the bloodletting , in which they were massively the victims , Tutsis made_up only 15 % of Rwanda ' s population . &quot; ' Tutsi-dominated government ' -- I frankly hate this expression , &quot; Twagirimungu said . &quot; This is a Rwandan government. &quot; Most of his ministers , he said , are Hutu . But in Africa , the leader of the army has often determined who really rules . Tacitly recognizing this , the Arusha pact called_for the RPF and the old government to evenly split the officer corps but for the rebels to supply only 40 % of the troops and the government the remainder . Clearly , nothing close to an amalgamation of the old rival forces is taking_place , although scattered officers and men of the defeated Rwandan government forces have joined the RPF ' s army . And the victors seem in no hurry to demobilize . On Kigali ' s Revolution Street , the young_men in natty berets and mismatched uniforms from the Rwandan Patriotic Front army stand_guard round the clock . Maj . Rutayisire , the government spokesman , said there was a plan to get &quot; children &quot; out of the army and everybody else into barracks but that its implementation would depend_on &quot; the security situation. &quot; Meanwhile , Rwanda ' s broke government is trying to cope . Many government employees have rallied to its support , Twagirimungu said . But since the new regime has been in power , there has been no money to pay them . Before they fled , the country ' s former rulers cleaned_out the vaults of the Rwandan National_Bank . Now &quot; people don ' t get their salaries -- they can ' t even get soap to wash themselves , &quot; Twagirimungu said . Private banks were likewise looted and remain closed . Hoarding their Rwandan francs to pay_for essentials -- many of which , from rice to gasoline , have doubled in price since April -- people are waiting for Twagirimungu ' s government to issue a new currency . He declined to say when that will happen .</TEXT>
