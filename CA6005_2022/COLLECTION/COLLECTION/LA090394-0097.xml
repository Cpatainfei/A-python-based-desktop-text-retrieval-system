   <HEADLINE> CANADA CITY POLICE_FORCE DISPLACED IN DRUG PROBE ; LAW : 35 PEOPLE IN MONTREAL SUBURB ARE CHARGED WITH TRAFFICKING AND OTHER ABUSES AFTER A SECRET INVESTIGATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a scene out of &quot; The Untouchables , &quot; Quebec provincial police have swept into this Montreal suburb and displaced the entire 24-member police_force in a drug-dealing and corruption investigation . Charges were brought Friday against 35 people , including two police_officers , one from Chambly and another from neighboring Brossard . Among the charges filed were trafficking in anabolic_steroids , conspiracy , possession of stolen property and weapons violations , said prosecutor Madeleine Giauque . She added that more charges are expected next week . Meanwhile , members of the provincial police , known here as Surete du Quebec , occupied the small brick police_headquarters , patrolled streets and carried_out other local enforcement duties . They also questioned city officials , including Mayor Pierre Bourbonnais , himself a Montreal police_officer . This pleasant bedroom community of 17 # 000 , set_on a reservoir half an hour ' s drive east of Montreal , has every appearance of a typical middle-class suburb . Except for the snow shovels_in the garages and the street_signs in French , many of the neighborhoods would not look_out of place in Anaheim or the San Gabriel Valley . But for years Chambly has been the subject of rumors of local corruption linked to drug-dealing gangs . The Surete du Quebec and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police launched investigations in 1988 , 1992 and 1993 , but each was compromised by leaks . This time , the probe was kept secret for five months and the first thing provincial officers did when they began their raids and seizures at 6 a.m. Thursday was to nab all_the Chambly police and move them to a nearby military base for questioning . At least 140 people were reportedly interrogated Thursday , and 350 provincial police participated in the raids , which took_place throughout Quebec but were centered here . Constable Lucie Boult , a Surete du Quebec spokeswoman , said Friday that four prosecutors had been assigned to review evidence . She added that Chambly police_officers would be subject_to internal discipline as well as criminal charges in the probe . She said potential violations included alcohol and cigarette smuggling , fraud and bribery , in addition to the charges brought Friday . Boult emphasized that not every Chambly officer is under suspicion and said some could be back on_the_job as early as next week , after discussions between provincial investigators and city officials . Provincial police will continue to perform local functions as long as necessary , she said . Bourbonnais was huddled with aides and investigators Friday and was unavailable for comment . But he told Canadian reporters Thursday that he was shocked by the corruption reports . That brought snorts of derision from some residents familiar_with previous investigations . &quot; This is an old town where everyone locks elbows and protects each other . You ' d see police driving_around in Corvettes and wonder where they got the money . Everyone would whisper , but no one talked , &quot; one woman , who described herself as a retired history teacher , told reporters . The Chambly police_force has been without a chief since June , when Fernand Gagnon ' s contract was not renewed after five years . Gagnon , a former Surete du Quebec officer , is suing for reinstatement and asserted that he instigated the investigation that led to the raids . The Chambly raid followed by a_few days a series of arrests throughout Quebec in a broad cocaine-smuggling and money-laundering investigation by the Mounted Police and the Surete du Quebec . Although unrelated , the two actions represent an increased emphasis by authorities on halting the illegal trade_in drugs , tax-free alcohol and tax-free cigarettes in the province . Much of the smuggling occurs on the border between Quebec and the United States . The United States serves as the source of the alcohol and cigarettes and the destination for many of the illegal drugs , police say .</TEXT>
