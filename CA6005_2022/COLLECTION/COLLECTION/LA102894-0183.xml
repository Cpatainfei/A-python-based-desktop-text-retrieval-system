   <HEADLINE> O.C. ECONOMY IS GOING NOWHERE FAST , STUDY SAYS ; ANNUAL CSUF FORECAST SEES GROWTH IN 1995 BUT AT A GLACIALLY SLOW PACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The recession that plagued the nation in 1990 and 1991 lingered in Orange County for another 2 1 / 2 years and is still reluctant to leave , according to economists at Cal State Fullerton . In its annual &quot; Orange County Economic Outlook &quot; report , released today , the university ' s Institute for Economic &amp; Environmental Studies foresees improvement through the first nine months of 1995 , but at a glacially slow pace . &quot; We are lagging behind the national economy instead of leading it , &quot; said Anil Puri , chairman of the CSUF economics_department . There are a number of potential bright spots , including a growing business services_industry and the county ' s increasingly important role in international trade . Puri said that 1994 is the first year since the recession began in mid-1990 in which Orange County employers will , collectively , add more jobs than they trim . The projected 0.76 % gain , he said , would add 8 # 500 jobs to local payrolls . Puri forecast a slightly stronger job increase for next year -- 0.85 % , or 9 # 500 new jobs . Construction , business services , the entertainment and amusement industries and government are expected to be the major sectors hiring . But there are also a_few trouble spots , the economist said Thursday , in_advance of a breakfast meeting today at which 300 local business_executives are expected to gather to hear the predictions . Chapman University , which has been issuing yearly Orange County outlook reports since 1982 , will release its 13th annual forecast in December . UC Irvine will follow early next year with a consumer confidence poll , and several big banks , including Wells Fargo , Bank of America and First Interstate , will issue reports on the Orange County economy as part of the statewide forecasts they will release in coming months . Businesses use the forecasts to help with budget and market planning . Cal State Fullerton ' s forecast is a fairly downbeat one , Puri acknowledged Thursday . &quot; The recession lasted longer than we expected , &quot; he said , &quot; and that length , almost 2 1 / 2 times the national recession , is unprecedented . So we are not as positive as we were last year. &quot; Though he is not predicting a return to recession , Puri said , the continuing decline in defense spending , a shrinking manufacturing base and uncertainty about interest_rates and inflation mean that &quot; things will continue to be difficult in the next few quarters . There are no major engines of growth purring along smoothly. &quot; Of the engines that are running , Puri holds_out the most hope for international trade , citing improving economic_conditions worldwide . A study soon to be released by CSUF ' s economic institute will show that 45 % of Orange County ' s foreign trade is with Pacific Rim nations , Puri said . With the exception of Japan , where a growth_rate of only 2.5 % is expected next year , the average expansion among Pacific Rim nations will range from 8 % to 11 % in 1995 , Puri said . Foreign trade , he said , &quot; provides a significant stimulus to the Orange County and regional economies . Nearly one in 10 jobs in Orange County is directly or indirectly dependent_on international trade. &quot; In 1993 , Orange County businesses exported almost $ 7 billion worth of goods , with computers , electronic_equipment and machinery at the top of the list . The new study predicts annual growth of about 6 % through the end of the century and suggests that the average will be closer to 7.5 % if the United States ratifies the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement -- a world trade pact that would slash tariffs , cut agricultural subsidies and open previously protected foreign markets . Somewhat offsetting Orange County ' s growth in foreign trade next year , however , will be the continued decline of the defense industry . Federal defense budget trimming began in_earnest in 1987 , Puri said , and in the ensuing six years Orange County military contractors slashed 31 # 000 jobs from their payrolls , 11 # 000 of them in high-technology fields . He is predicting that an additional 19 # 000 defense-related jobs will be lost to the county by 1998 . The recently announced decision by Hughes Electronics to close much of its Fullerton research campus , lay off about 1 # 000 of the workers and transfer almost 5 # 000 more to facilities outside Orange County &quot; is just one aspect of the continuing job losses &quot; related to defense cutbacks , Puri said . One Sign of Recovery Orange County ' s economic recovery will lag the national pace next year . But a positive sign is that growth in the county ' s gross product -- the dollar value of all goods and services produced during the year -- is expected to start outstripping increases in the national gross_domestic_product by the end of the year . Change from previous quarter in U.S. gross_domestic_product and Orange County gross product : Fourth quarter 1994 United States : 2.86 % ( projected ) Orange County : 3.80 % ( projected ) Source : Institute for Economic &amp; Environmental Studies , Cal State Fullerton Promising Signs Two positive signals for the local economy are in jobs and personal_income . Hiring will accelerate at the end of this year for a net annual gain of 8 # 500 jobs . And the county ' s total personal_income -- a measure of liquid income including wages , dividends , interest and Social_Security payments -- is expected to rise by almost 5 % after several lackluster years . Total Non-Agricultural Employment ( % change from same quarter previous year ) Fourth quarter 1994 : . 87 % ( projected ) Personal_Income ( in billions of dollars ) 1995 : $ 69 billion ( projected ) Source : Institute for Economic &amp; Environmental Studies , Cal State Fullerton</TEXT>
