   <HEADLINE> O.C. MUSIC REVIEW ; DRESDEN BRINGS A GUEST MAESTRO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> America hasn ' t seen much of the Dresdner Philharmonie , a.k.a. the Dresden Philharmonic . This distinguished orchestra , founded in 1870 , did make something of a splash when it first visited the States back in 1909 . But then came a_couple_of world_wars . And then came the partitioning of Germany , which left Dresden curtained_off in the forbidden east . We heard recordings , of course , and a_few broadcasts . We knew that this was an ensemble with a fabulous history involving such conductors as Brahms , Dvorak and Tchaikovsky , not to mention Bulow , Busch , Nikisch , Kleiber pere and Masur . But the Dresdeners never came_close to Southern California until this week . And now it can be argued -- also lamented -- that we have heard the Philharmonie under less than authentic conditions . For the current tour , the orchestra left one key player at_home : its official music-director . His name -- not exactly a household commodity hereabouts -- is Jorg-Peter Weigle . Although he has been in_charge since 1986 , the tour sponsors probably regarded his international obscurity as a box-office liability . * He may be a neglected genius . He may be a talent unworthy_of export . Chances are , we ' ll never know . In September , Michel Plasson , a much-traveled Frenchman , will take_over ; Yuri Temirkanov , the eccentric Russian , will assume the duties of principal guest-conductor . The days of musical nationalism are obviously drawing to a close . The man wielding the baton Tuesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center was Philippe Entremont of Rheims , France . Long celebrated as an elegant pianist , he has recently joined such colleagues as Daniel Barenboim and Vladimir Ashkenazy in the apparently irresistible quest_for stellar fulfillment on the podium . He is , without doubt , an enlightened musician , a solid technician and an authoritative leader . On this occasion , however , he did not prove himself a distinctive or subtle interpreter of Brahms , Beethoven and Tchaikovsky . * That may_not be entirely his fault . It takes time to establish maximum rapport with an orchestra , and we have no indication that the Dresdeners ever encountered Entremont before they packed their bags this month . Under the circumstances , one had to applaud the attentive professionalism of all concerned . One had to admire the unison sheen of the Dresden strings , if not the occasionally blaring brass and intermittently nasal winds . One could appreciate the special blend of big , bright , slender tone , and the discipline in_depth . Still , one couldn ' t help wondering how this orchestra sounds at the Kulturpalast am Altmarkt . The Costa Mesa concert , presented by the Orange County Philharmonic Society , began with a crisp and brisk , emphatically unpompous performance of Brahms ' &quot; Academic Festival &quot; overture . It ended with a propulsive , colorful , emphatically unsentimental performance of Tchaikovsky ' s &quot; Little Russian &quot; Symphony . The troubles came_in between , with Beethoven ' s wondrous Triple Concerto for piano , violin and cello . Entremont made the fateful decision to wave directions from the keyboard , and he paid a price for his ambition . Unable to devote full attention to the orchestra , he had to settle for generalities when specific instructions were most wanted . Dynamic subtleties were slighted accordingly . Coordination and precision became sometime things . * Possibly distracted by his conducting duties , Entremont played the piano solos rather perfunctorily . That is hardly his style . And having to face his orchestra meant that he had to turn his back on his fellow soloists . Cho-Liang Lin , the dauntless violinist , gave the performance as much finesse as he could . Carter Brey , the sympathetic cellist , often found lofty intentions compromised by dubious intonation . Still , there was little wrong with this performance that a conductor couldn ' t have fixed . Perhaps next time . . . .</TEXT>
