   <HEADLINE> AIDA GREY , SKIN_CARE INNOVATOR , DIES ; COSMETICS : FRANCHISE FOUNDER CREATED RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE WARES TO WARD OFF TIRED SKIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Aida Grey , the doyenne of skin_care who founded a series of cosmetic franchises that today are busy battling wrinkles and the other menacing marks of_age , died Friday night . A spokeswoman for her Beverly Hills-based company said Miss Grey , the daughter of a French dermatologist who had battled acne as a teen-ager , died at Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center . She had been ill for some time and her death was attributed to heart_failure . The cosmetics counselor to Marilyn Monroe and hundreds of thousands of lesser-known women and men in the United States and Europe was always secretive about her age . She was believed to be in her mid-80s , although she did not look it and denied that she had ever had a face_lift . It was Aida Grey products that kept Aida Grey looking 20 years younger than she was , she liked to say . Her credo was : &quot; Everybody ' s born with good skin . . . . It ' s what you do with your skin that counts. &quot; And in a town where appearance often ranks ahead of reality she offered women ( and later men ) relatively inexpensive wares to ward_off tired skin . Among them were cucumber lotions , raspberry masks and time-release mini-facials . She wrote and spoke extensively about skin_care , advocating her collagen moisturizers , in-store facials and deep-pore cleaning to restore and maintain the diminishing glow of youth . Among her most innovative creations was a seaweed facial that lasts 90 minutes and leaves a mask that is lifted from the client ' s face . In 1987 , Women ' s Wear Daily estimated her annual wholesale volume at $ 4 million to $ 5 million . The more_than 100 franchises she launched in the United States , Kenya , Portugal , Ireland and elsewhere receive big discounts for purchasing the estimated 150 items shipped from a huge warehouse in Beverly Hills , home of her extravagant Institute de Beaute on Wilshire Boulevard . But Miss Grey , in an accent that reflected her French heritage , said she never sought fame while amassing a small_fortune . Instead , it was individual service that brought her satisfaction . &quot; It has to be custom-style , &quot; she said in 1987 . &quot; We blend everything and we match things to people . I don ' t want mass production. &quot; She was among the first to preach the advantages of holistic treatments , using fruits , vegetables and herbs . Miss Grey began her beauty empire in the 1940s after finding , she said , that she was allergic to her own cosmetics . Her first salon was a relatively modest 5 # 000-square-foot treatment and makeup center in Beverly Hills . From the beginning , she said she never claimed , as did so many others , that her treatments could remove wrinkles . &quot; Only plastic_surgery removes wrinkles , &quot; she would say . But her creams and lotions ( some of which sold for only $ 5 or $ 6 ) could help postpone that procedure or make_it unnecessary . Many of those who sought her advice and guidance could have paid 10 times her prices : among them Cary Grant , Joan Crawford , Julie Christie , Ingrid Bergman , Jacqueline Bisset , Nancy Reagan and Miss Monroe , who Miss Grey said &quot; was not a great beauty. &quot; For all her public posturing , she was a private person . A Los Angeles Times reporter in 1979 asked about her private life and in response was told about the benefits of ginseng lotion . All Miss Grey would advance without reluctance was : &quot; I was put_on this earth to help people look better . That is what I am all about. &quot; She said that because of her modest prices , women who had resigned themselves to looking old could slow or reverse the process . And they did not have to sleep_with a gooey night cream on their skin . &quot; You ' re wasting your time and your love life . Your skin is like your stomach , it thrives on very small meals , very frequently. &quot; Creams and lotions should be used only 20 minutes and then removed . &quot; And no makeup or skin_care product should cost $ 100 unless it ' s in a gallon jug. &quot; While the heart of her operation was in sunny Southern California , she preached that sun and healthy skin were adversaries . Her charitable works included complimentary consultations to the UCLA School of Public Health , the Sybil Brand Institute for Women , St . Anne ' s Maternity Home , the Veterans Administration and many_more . Among her other honors , she was named &quot; entrepreneur of the year &quot; by the Los Angeles YWCA in 1991 . The American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery has recognized her efforts to improve the understanding of their specialty . She continued to write beauty columns for newspapers and magazines until shortly before her recent illness . Her Encyclopedia of Beauty is scheduled to be published soon . In person , she was &quot; slightly flamboyant , &quot; wrote a Times fashion writer several years ago . &quot; Pleasantly rounded , perfectly manicured , conservatively coiffed . . . ( she ) commands attention wherever she goes. &quot; It was an aura , Miss Grey said , she had created for herself and which any woman could emulate . And it was her hope that &quot; every woman will do just that. &quot; In her memory , her Beverly Hills and Biltmore Hotel salons will be closed Monday so employees may attend her funeral at noon at Mt . Sinai . Survivors include her husband , Douglas Behrend , an attorney ; a son , Steven ; a daughter , Loretta Dix ; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren .</TEXT>
