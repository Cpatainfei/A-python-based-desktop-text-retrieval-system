   <HEADLINE> A SAN JUAN ISLANDS PRIMER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So you don ' t want to charter a schooner ? An even larger and more imposing vessel awaits to take you to the popular San Juan Islands of Washington : The ferry , the state ' s No . 1 tourist attraction . The easy way , yes . But these days , when getting places is not always part of the fun , the comfortable , scenic ferry ride is reason enough to journey through these green , sheltered islands . In fact , for some first-time visitors , the ferry is the very best part of a trip to the islands , whose huge tourist appeal has in some cases outstripped local visitor facilities . In the four years I ' ve lived_in Seattle and the 20 years I ' ve been coming_to the San Juans , I ' ve learned that a simple way to make a lasting impression on visitors is with nothing more complex or expensive than the one- to two-hour ferry from Anacortes , Wash. , to Friday Harbor on San Juan Island , and a lively jaunt ashore . In summer , that can mean anything from renting a kayak and paddling out with the seals , or taking a drive to the site of one of the strangest military battles in U.S. history -- the little-known &quot; Pig War &quot; with Britain . Easy park and shoreline hikes in ocean-scrubbed fresh air , whale-watching cruises and family bicycling on two-lane roads also draw enthusiasts . The San Juans are composed of more_than 400 islands lying_in sheltered ocean waters north of Seattle , between Washington state and Vancouver Island , British_Columbia . About 60 islands are inhabited and four primary islands are served by state ferries . Three of them -- San Juan , Orcas and Lopez -- have visitor services and accommodations . The busiest island is San Juan , with its village of Friday Harbor . Shaw has very limited facilities . Locals will tell you the San Juans are the closest you can get_to a banana belt in the high latitudes . In the rain shadow of Vancouver Island , the islands receive only half the rainfall of Seattle , and the high-season months of July , August and early September offer more sun than just about anywhere this far north near ocean water . Locals also will tell you that peak-season tourism has ballooned to_the_point that unwary , happy-go-lucky travelers often go_away feeling neither happy nor lucky . Parking , water shortages and crowded approaches to ferries and tourist attractions can be frustrating . * A day trip promises the fewest pitfalls for newcomers . Ferries depart for the San Juans from Anacortes , about a 1 1 / 2- to two-hour drive north from Seattle . A pleasant stop en route is the community of La Conner , an old fishing village and trading_post that has given itself over to waterfront tourism -- small shops and plenty of cafes and a good , old-fashioned ambience . And , of course , summer crowds . Ferry sailings from Anacortes begin before dawn and run until just past midnight in summers -- a total of 18 sailings per day . Food and beverages are available aboard , and sightseeing is splendid from either the open sun-deck or the enclosed passenger lounges . Sometimes ferries leave just a_few minutes apart and sometimes there is more_than an hour between sailings . that ' s because some boats go directly to Friday Harbor , a one-hour sail , and others stop en route at the other islands , which can extend the one-way trip to two hours . The ferry approaches can be congested and intimidating at first . But press ahead , this is not like trying to ride the subway in a strange city -- the ticket sellers are accustomed to wide-eyed tourists and the staging process actually goes quite smoothly . Tickets are sold only for westbound sailings ; returns are free . The exceptions are two daily sailings that continue past Friday Harbor to Sidney , B.C. , north of Victoria . On those trips , fares are collected in both directions . But anyone contemplating a summertime ferry trip faces a crucial choice before getting_in line : take the car or walk on the ferry without it ? Joyce Myhr of the San Juan Islands Visitors Information Service cautions you to consider carefully : &quot; You have to ask yourself , how do you want to spend your time ? In the car ferry line ? Or worrying how you are going_to get_around once you ' re there ? &quot; According to Myhr , for a day trip in the middle of the season , it makes little sense to drive your car . The principal islands are big enough , and the parks and sights spread_out for miles , that many sightseers choose to drive anyway , at least for their first visit . But they must pay the price : Weekend ferry lines for motorists can stretch for three hours , or sometimes more . ( Ferry toll for car and driver from Anacortes to Friday Harbor , $ 20.30. No reservations . Schedule information : ( 206 ) 464-6400 . Tip : If you want to see more_than one island , start on San Juan , at the far west , and work your way back free_of charge. ) Particularly crowded are holiday weekends and July 29-31 , the dates of the Dixieland Jazz_Festival in Friday Harbor ( three-day pass , $ 40 ; daily , $ 10 to $ 25 ; tel . 206- 378-5509 ) . During the festival , even parking can be a chore . Walk-on ferry passengers , by contrast , never wait for the next boat . But parking at the Anacortes terminal is limited . ( The toll from Anacortes to Friday Harbor is $ 4.95. ) And upon your arrival in Friday Harbor , public transportation is limited to a half-dozen cabs island-wide . * There are plenty of things to occupy active walk-ons , however . Friday Harbor in summer is alive_with bicycle and scooter rentals . ( Island Bicycles has been established for some time . Rates $ 25 per day for a mountain_bike , with weekly prices available ; tel . 206-378-4941. ) Bicycles also are available for rental at the Orcas Island ferry landing . For the most part , the tempo of the islands is easygoing . Bicyclists enjoy respect on the two-lane roads , if for no other reason than there are so many of them . There are no bike paths or shoulders . A typical cycling itinerary for vacationers would begin in Friday Harbor , with two days spent on San Juan Island , traversing mixed landscapes of rolling pastures , moist forests , wind-blown prairie and driftwood beaches . The town of Friday Harbor is a mix of come-on tourism and rural seashore trading_post , pleasant enough for meals and quick browsing but light on night life . For some visitors , the community is too &quot; touristy , &quot; while others , perhaps remembering East Coast island resorts , find themselves wishing for more and better shops . The small downtown Whale Museum , which provides public access to long-standing research efforts in the region , offers static displays and explanations of whale lore . ( Admission $ 3 ; tel . 206-378-4710. ) * The harbor is colorful and active ; a bustle of boats , big and small , as well as seaplanes and , of course , the ferry . Dock-walking can be pleasant . At least three local companies in Friday Harbor and two on Orcas Island offer whale watching cruises ( Western Prince Cruises , Friday Harbor , has been in business nine years . A four-hour afternoon trip in search of orca or Minke whales , $ 43 , or $ 31 for children ; tel . 800-757-6722. ) Cyclists can walk their bikes onto the ferry from one island and visit the other islands -- Lopez being the flattest and Orcas the hilliest . Bicycle camping is particularly inviting on Lopez after a 30-mile loop ride around this drowsy , friendly island . On Orcas , it is a steep climb but worth it to reach the top of 2 # 400-foot Mt . Constitution , where on a clear day one can see from British_Columbia to the volcanoes of the Cascades . Bicycle outfitters can direct you to private campgrounds on the islands , which usually have room . State campgrounds , on the other hand , fill_up faster . Shaw Island is the smallest , most private of those served by the ferries -- and has only a_few camping spaces . Overnighters who come_to Lopez , Orcas and San Juan islands by car or foot will find 50 different resorts , inns , motels and B &amp; B ' s , some of them secluded and worth the hunt . But together , they offer only about 800 rooms . On busy weekends , thousands of tourists flock to the islands , making advance reservations mandatory . ( Recommended guidebook : Northwest Best Places , $ 18.95 , Sasquatch Books , which also covers Portland to British_Columbia . A list of island accommodations and a trip planning guide is available from the county Visitor Information Service , P.O. Box 65 , Lopez Island , Wash . 98261 ; tel . 206-468-3663 . But the two-person staff is sometimes overwhelmed. ) A timely note on accommodations : A Hollywood production company has now taken most of the rooms on Lopez Island and some on San Juan , and is expected to be in the islands well into June . * Venturing from Friday Harbor on San Juan Island , cyclists and motorists both are attracted to Lime Kiln Point State Park , which overlooks Haro Strait on the far western shore of the island and offers your best chance of seeing a passing pod of orca , or killer_whales . Roche Harbor , a favorite with yachters , is a pleasant way-stop resort at the northern end . National historic parks are maintained at the separate American and British camps , remnants of the disputed 19th-Century occupation of the island . Tension between the two sides led to the &quot; Pig War &quot; of 1860 , so-named because its single casualty was a pig . Throughout the islands , bald_eagles , seals , ducks and sea_birds are abundant . Tide pools are plentiful , and there are cliffs and hilltops with smashing views into the ink-blue waters below and to the neighboring islands in the distance . If you want to get closer to the water , here is your chance to find_out why everyone is so crazy about ocean kayaking . In these lightweight boats , even an easy pull of the paddle sends you shooting across the water . ( Kayak rentals at Emerald Seas International , Friday Harbor ; tel . 206-378-2772 . Rates $ 15 per person for two hours , $ 25 for four hours . Proprietor Tom Hemphill drives you to Griffin Bay , where you launch in ultra-calm water . The shop also offers twice-a-day dive charters for $ 55 and diving instruction . Other island outfitters lead longer , guided kayak trips for the more adventuresome. ) Boaters know the San Juans as a cruisers paradise , and there is little doubt that the most pleasant way to experience the San Juans is afloat . Bareboat charters are abundant . ( In Anacortes , Anacortes Yacht Charters has long boasted the biggest fleet of charter yachts in the United States -- more_than 100 sail and power boats ; tel . 800-233-3004 . Penmar Marine Co . in Anacortes has a fleet of 60 craft ; tel . 800-828-7337 . Both companies can arrange skippers for your cruise. ) Tidal currents require boaters , particularly sailers , to plan their itinerary carefully . Summer winds are fickle , and the usual rule_in the area is that the better the weather , the lighter the wind . Also , popular anchorages can be very crowded and will test your skill . On the upside , there is no bothersome ocean swell , so seasickness is uncommon . And navigation by line-of-sight is quite easy , except in fog , when it ' s foolish to venture forth . * Season by season , week by week , local sail and powerboat owners on San Juan and Lopez islands offer skippered day cruises . Tourist officials say you can inquire at the bulletin_boards at the docks . During fishing_season , some boat owners also offer charters . Boaters have much broader choices for island_hopping than visitors who rely_on ferries . Reid Harbor on Stuart Island is a picture-perfect anchorage , usually filled and some times overfilled with boaters . This is &quot; social &quot; boating , not meant for those who want to get_away from it all . A few of the islands are designated as state parks for boaters only , including a cluster of islands at the far north of the chain -- Sucia , Matia , Clark and Patos islands . These offer pleasant day hiking through forest and around sculpted sea cliffs . Anchorages are scattered through several bays .</TEXT>
