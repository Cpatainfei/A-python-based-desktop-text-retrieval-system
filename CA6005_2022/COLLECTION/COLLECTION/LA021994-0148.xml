   <HEADLINE> A RETURN TO THE SCENE OF CONQUEST ; MAJOR NORMAN EXHIBITION OPENS IN ROME 910 YEARS AFTER VIKING INVASION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Exactly 910 years after they came_to pillage this city , the heirs of fierce Viking pirates have returned to enchant it . In 1084 , the Northmen sacked parts of the Eternal City in a terror campaign of conquest that included Southern Italy and Sicily , which they ruled for two centuries . Now they have returned as &quot; The Normans , People of Europe , &quot; in a groundbreaking exhibition that is drawing enthusiastic crowds to the Palazzo Venezia in the heart of the city . &quot; This is the first major Norman exhibition , and we will have succeeded if it makes the people of a united Europe realize that they are not products of one single culture but of many , &quot; said Mario D ' Onofrio , organizer of the exhibition that will remain in Rome through April , then move to Venice ' s Palazzo Ducale from mid-May until September . D ' Onofrio , a professor of medieval art at Rome University , spent six years assembling a show of intriguing glimpses of a warrior race better known across the centuries as conquerors than for their prowess as builders and governors . * The result is engrossing , if uneven -- tools , weapons , clothing , jewelry , 1 # 000-year-old shoes for small horses , knights ' armor , scale models and manuscripts . The works are drawn from collections in 11 countries , including pieces from museums in New York and Boston . The exhibition was assembled with the support of patrons , including the presidents of France and Italy and the Queen of England . All three countries once feared the Northmen ' s tread . Vikings sweeping down from what is now Scandinavia rooted themselves in Northern France . They learned French , adopted Catholicism and rowed across the Channel under William the Conqueror to vanquish England . They then marched south through the Holy_Roman_Empire and around it by sea . They sent armed expeditions down to the shores of North Africa , and east as far as Antioch and Ankara . They mounted the Crusades under knights such_as England ' s King Richard I , known as the Lion-Hearted . With that as background , note that Rome ' s thoughtful new exhibition is not for the jet-lagged . There is much to absorb . The show -- predictably -- opens stressing the Norman ' s war-tossed ascendancy . There are dented war helmets , lovingly hewn battle axes and swords , spurs and chain-mail armor that passed reverently from father to son -- all tools of the invaders ' trade_in the mid-11th Century . The exhibition is organized topically . But there is an element of eclecticism . One portion focuses_on a medical_school in Salerno founded under Norman rule by the Jew Helinus , the Greek Pontus , the Arab Adela and the Latin Salernus ; it survived into the 19th Century . Replicas of 1 # 000-year-old surgeons ' and dentists ' tools -- gruesome drills , saws , pliers , knives -- will , uh , make you glad you floss . Spare a moment for the forest as you stroll among the Norman trees . The Palazzo Venezia , built partially of stones from the nearby Colosseum , was the first Renaissance palace in Rome . It was the palace of Popes , the Venetian Embassy and , in this century , the headquarters-cum-balcony for Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini . One crowd-stopping Norman work in the breathtaking museum-palace is a six-meter square diorama , painstakingly detailed and historically accurate : 1 # 600 painted , lead soldiers nervously await trumpet ' s blare to begin the Battle_of_Hastings , which sealed Norman victory over England in 1066 . That and other Norman triumphs are also portrayed in a reproduction of a long segment of the Bayeux Tapestry -- the 11th-Century ' s anticipation of the modern comic_book -- a bloody narration of Norman prowess in battle which , legend has it , was stitched with the help of William ' s wife , Queen Matilda . But there was more to the Normans than war . While that is the least-known part of their story , it is perhaps the most alluring part of the exhibition . &quot; In marching across England , France and Italy , they created a territorial , juridical and cultural unity that in some cases survived into the 19th Century , &quot; D ' Onofrio said . The Normans -- militant Christians who defended the Pope and sprang forth as Crusaders in vain attempts to conquer the Holy_Land -- never cultivated the arts . But they did establish some of their era ' s best governments , systematizing feudalism and introducing stability as remedy to Medieval anarchy . They also were remarkable architects : Scale-models feature their fortified towns , their high-towered defensive castles ( like the Tower_of_London ) and their splendid cathedrals . Norman churches are still European landmarks in places as diverse as Winchester , England ; Caen , France , and in Sicily , where the Norman style melded with Arab and Byzantine to produce masterpieces like the cathedral of Monreale . ( Here in Rome , the Normans built fires , not buildings . In fact , the burn_marks of their sack are still visible at the ancient basilica of the Santissimi Coronati , titular church of Los Angeles ' Cardinal Roger Mahony. ) Norman King Roger II wore a gorgeous red and gold silk coronation cape in 1130 to become the first king of Sicily ; his soldiers wagered on dice forged from a stag ' s horn . Both are there -- the cape a striking reproduction -- in engaging sections of the show that examine the bric-a-brac of daily and ceremonial life and death : marble statues and capitals , illuminated Bibles , coins , brooches , cups , reliquaries , mosaics , stained glass , household implements and terra_cotta jars for storing oil and grain . The exhibition also includes an ambitious but unconvincing multimedia introduction to the Normans , and -- change of pace -- a high-tech salon where the Normans and their civilization come_to_life from press-the-screen computers . * &quot; I Normanni , Popolo d ' Europa , &quot; is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. , 8:30 p.m. on weekends , in Palazzo Venezia at the Piazza Venezia in the center of Rome until April 30 . Admission is about $ 6 . The same exhibition reopens at Palazzo Ducale in Venice on May 20 until Sept . 17 .</TEXT>
