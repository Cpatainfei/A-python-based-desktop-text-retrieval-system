   <HEADLINE> MEATLESS FEASTS ; INDIA ' S VEGETARIAN SPLENDORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In India , vegetarian food is so highly developed that it can easily outshine dense , chunky , chewy meat dishes . Religion , scarcity or high cost of meat and generations of tradition make vegetarianism a basic lifestyle in that vast country . Some vegetarians are very strict -- I have seen Jain priests with masks over their faces to keep them from accidentally inhaling insects . Others are more relaxed . Bengali vegetarians eat fish because it ' s abundant in that coastal state . So do inhabitants of the southern state of Kerala . And some vegetarians are willing to eat soups made with meat broth although they avoid meat itself . Each region has its own specialties , its own way of seasoning . The western state of Gujarat , which is heavily vegetarian , leans toward sweet tastes . South Indian cooks perform incredible feats with lentils . Grains such_as millet are important in the desert state of Rajasthan . And Punjabis adore simple greens with corn bread . Certain hotels such_as the Woodlands and Dasaprakash groups provide only vegetarian food . But all restaurants and hotels in India have plenty of choices for non-meat-eaters . Some glossy five-star hotels even set_up twin lunch buffet lines -- one for vegetarians , the other for those who eat meat . On Indian trains , you don ' t order by the dish but by dietary preference . The tray of food -- either with meat or vegetarian -- is brought_to your seat , like an airline meal . At least that ' s the way it is in the second-class cars in which I have traveled . Chicken curry -- the usual &quot; meat &quot; entree -- was pretty good on some routes , not so good on others . But the vegetarian food was always wonderful . It ' s also a wise choice if you are worried about food safety . Clever seasonings and tremendous variety make this food addictive . And there ' s plenty of it wherever immigrants from India have settled . Southern California ' s Indian restaurants always provide vegetarian options and a_few serve vegetarian food only . A large part of the inventory at Indian markets here consists_of the lentils , rice and spices that vegetarians employ with such artistry . Here is a look_at how they cook . &quot; We are together cooking , &quot; says Phulan Chander , her Punjabi way of speaking spilling over into English . She smiles , thinking_of husband Ramesh and the smooth way they work in the kitchen . &quot; No fighting , &quot; she insists . Their home_in Hawthorne is indeed peaceful as they put_together a multi-course vegetarian meal . The food is Punjabi -- except for a curry leaf here and there . This strongly flavored leaf appears in South Indian dishes , not northern food . But when you have a treeful just outside your kitchen , you are tempted to experiment . This day , the Chanders are cooking the tiny black legumes called urad dal . Ramesh handles the dal while Phulan rolls_out matti -- biscuit-like cakes that Punjabis eat with tea . Flavored with the aromatic spice ajwain , the cakes magically turn_into multilayered pastries when fried . Already on the table is another tea snack -- cashews fried golden-brown and sprinkled with cayenne , black_pepper and exotic-tasting chat masala . Still to come are ravishingly spiced eggplant -- baingan bharta -- and potato dumplings in pale-yellow yogurt sauce . The dumplings , made with chick pea_flour , are called pakoras . For cool contrast there will be raita , a yogurt relish containing tiny balls of deep-fried chick pea batter . These are boondi , and you can buy them ready-made in Indian shops , but Phulan makes her own , dropping the batter through the holes of a large spoon into hot oil . Like most other Indian women , she bakes chapatis after her guests are seated so the breads stay_fresh and hot . And she whips together an impromptu lassi that has a unique taste , unknown in Western cuisine . This comes from kewra , a liquid seasoning extracted from the flowers of the screw_pine tree and so powerful that it has to be doled_out by the drop . Over and over as she cooks , Chander says , &quot; I have too many recipes. &quot; This does not mean that her file is overloaded , just that she knows how to make many dishes . And she freely shares her recipes with customers at Bharat Bazaar , the Chander family ' s Indian grocery in Culver City . The Chanders cook Punjabi style , but Sada Siva Rao serves the wildly hot dishes of Andhra Pradesh in South India . To experience the fiery intensity of Andhra food , eat_at Rao ' s restaurant , the Bombay Grill in West Hollywood . Not everything is blistering hot , but when Rao cooks to his own taste , he ladles in heaps of blazing red chile powder and big spoonfuls of Southern-style masala -- spices ground with coconut . The trick is to temper the heat by eating a little curry with a lot of rice , he says . Rao ' s tiny restaurant , tucked_in the back of a mall near a kosher bakery , draws lots of studio people . And the conversation is often heavily spiked with English accents because Britishers who know Indian food gather there . So do Indians who want foods they can ' t get elsewhere . One draw is homemade pickles : fat garlic_cloves with sesame_seeds , pickled fresh fenugreek leaves , spinach with coriander_seeds and others . These are hot too , but one eats them in little bites with plain foods like such_as rice and yogurt . Rao cooks in a truly hot spot . His big range is next to the inferno-like tandoor oven . In this feverish setting he tosses handfuls of serrano chiles into a pot along with more chile powder than most of us would use in weeks . These zip_up the intensity of mushroom senagapappu , chewy yellow chana dal cooked with mushrooms . Another load of chile powder goes_into the tomato_sauce for guttivankaya , an eggplant dish . Rao hasn ' t been able to get the baby eggplants he prefers for this dish , so he substitutes long , slim Japanese eggplant . These he cuts_in half , then slivers in quarters , leaving the ends attached . Both dishes are hot enough to induce sniffles , tears and even serious inner pain . And Rao says the obvious : Season them to your own taste , which probably means using a lot less chile powder . In the Punjab , there ' s a wonderful winter dish of spiced mustard greens -- saag -- that one eats with bright yellow corn bread called makki ki roti . At Nirula ' s snack shop in New Delhi , the saag is rich with butter , and the combination comes_with a little cup of shakkar -- brown_sugar crystals -- to add a tantalizing sweet taste . Here in Southern California , you can try the saag and bread at Chameli , a North Indian vegetarian restaurant in Rosemead . Owner Hari B . Alipuria , who is from Patiala in the Punjab , remembers how his mother slapped the dough on a stone slab and baked the tortilla-like breads on a griddle that she sprinkled with cornmeal to prevent sticking . In Punjabi homes , the corn was stone-ground by hand , he says . That kind of cornmeal is not available in California , so Alipuria makes_do with a supermarket brand . Family tradition was to chop bushels of greens at night . Then Alipuria ' s father would get_up early to simmer the saag for hours . Long , slow cooking brought_out the full flavor . Alipuria ' s wife , Linda , who reworked Chameli ' s recipe to household size , says many Punjabis season the dish with only butter and salt . In restaurants here , saag is_well spiced , and it often includes spinach along with mustard greens . Chameli ' s saag and corn bread do not ooze as much butter as they would in India because the chefs are instructed to reduce fats . The breads are lightly brushed with butter on one side only , then stacked . A pat of butter should go_in the center of a bowl of steaming saag , though . Or one can skip the butter and sprinkle the saag with Chameli ' s alternative topping -- fried chopped ginger . Or make a good thing even better by using both . Paneer bhurji looks a lot like scrambled eggs with tomato_sauce , So you ' re surprised to find_out that it is cheese -- not Western-style firm cheese but soft , freshly clotted milk stirred together with sauteed onions and tomatoes . &quot; It ' s one of our favorite dishes . I make_it all_the time , &quot; says Pammi Singh , whose husband , Lakhi , owns the Bombay Kitchen on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles . Although common in Punjabi households in North India , paneer bhurji is difficult to find in restaurants here . At the Bombay Kitchen , vegetarians eat it with dal ( lentils ) , whole-wheat paratha ( a flat Indian bread ) and a vegetable dish such_as bhindi masala ( spiced okra ) , aloo gobi ( potatoes and cauliflower ) or navratnam curry , composed of vegetables and nuts . At home , Pammi Singh sometimes adds green_peas to make paneer bhurji even more colorful . And she always has raita , a yogurt relish , on the table . The Bombay Kitchen , only 8 months old , is still undergoing changes . One dish headed for the menu is the soothing ginger-lentil soup that Lakhi Singh ' s grandmother would brew up during harsh North Indian cold_spells . It ' s the vegetarian version of chicken_soup , good for whatever ails you even if the weather isn ' t cold . Like the Chanders , Pammi and Lakhi Singh enjoy cooking together at_home . &quot; We experiment , and if it turns_out well , we take it to the restaurant , &quot; she says . Indian desserts are usually terribly rich , extremely sweet and very time-consuming to make . To get the rich taste and thick texture required for the many sweets based on milk , one has to boil the milk patiently until it reduces and the flavor deepens . Mira Advani , who was born in a part of India that is now Pakistan , has figured_out how to get_around this obstacle . When she makes burfi , a candy-like sweet , she cuts_down the cooking time by using ricotta cheese instead of milk . And she adds nonfat_dry_milk powder to make the mixture thicker . To get the right taste , though , she has to add butter . But she watches her diet strictly enough to afford an occasional treat . And she trims the fat grams somewhat by using fat-free ricotta . Advani teaches vegetarian cooking at the Oaks at Ojai , the Palms in Palm Springs and at her home_in West Los Angeles . Occasionally she eats fish , but for months at a time , she ' s totally vegetarian . &quot; I just feel it keeps me healthy , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s a way of cutting_down on fat . Of course , I love vegetables . They ' re good to eat and so colorful. &quot; * Pakoras are vegetable fritters . In this recipe , they ' re made only with potatoes , but Phulan Chander often combines as_many as five vegetables , each cut_into tiny pieces . The combination might include spinach for attractive green color , potato , eggplant , onion and cauliflower . CURRY PAKORA 1 cup yogurt 3 cups water 3 tablespoons besan ( chick pea_flour ) 1 teaspoon salt 1 / 2 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 1 / 2 tablespoons olive_oil 1 / 8 teaspoon asafetida 1 medium onion , chopped 1 jalapeno chile , chopped 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 / 2 to 1 teaspoon ground fenugreek 4 curry leaves , optional Potato Pakoras Oil for deep-frying Place yogurt in bowl and stir well .
