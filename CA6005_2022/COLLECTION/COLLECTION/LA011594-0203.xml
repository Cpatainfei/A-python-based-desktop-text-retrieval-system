   <HEADLINE> 4TH ESCAPE SHAKES THE COMMUNITY ' S CONFIDENCE ; CORRECTIONS : CIVIC LEADERS ON THE LANCASTER PRISON ' S ADVISORY PANEL BELIEVE THE INCIDENTS EXPOSE FLAWS . THEY WILL URGE FULL INVESTIGATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Civic leaders who toured the new state_prison in Lancaster shortly after it opened last February were assured that prisoners could not escape via the garbage_trucks driving_in and out of the facility . But on Thursday , a 25-year-old inmate , serving a life sentence for shooting a California Highway Patrol officer , did just that . Although the man was recaptured , members of the prison ' s community advisory committee said Friday that they were upset about the prison ' s fourth escape in less than a year , the second involving a high-security inmate . &quot; Whenever someone breaks_out of prison , there ' s a hole in the system , &quot; Lancaster Councilman George Root said . &quot; It sounds like someone wasn ' t doing their job again. &quot; Antelope Valley College President Allan Kurki , who also serves on the advisory panel , said the detention center &quot; was clearly sold here in the community as a state-of-the-art prison that would be as escape-proof as possible . . . . This is very disturbing to me. &quot; The prisoner who escaped Thursday , Steven Charles Brigida , originally of Thousand Oaks , was injured when the garbage_truck compressed him into a bale , then dumped him in a landfill . He was recaptured and taken_to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical_Center , where he was being treated Friday for broken ribs , officials said . Minutes after prison administrators learned about the escape , they notified the 15 members of the advisory panel . The committee meets regularly with Warden Otis Thurman to discuss local concerns about the prison -- built despite protests by numerous residents . James T . Lott , the committee ' s chairman , said it has become tougher to convince residents that the prison , housing about 4 # 000 inmates , poses no danger to them . &quot; I still feel it is a safe prison , &quot; said Lott , a school administrator . &quot; But I can ' t convince people it ' s a safe prison when we keep having these escapes . There ' s a weak link somewhere , and we need to get that repaired. &quot; Lott said the escape will be addressed at the panel ' s next meeting Jan . 26 . &quot; Our committee will request a full investigation , &quot; he said . &quot; we ' ll have many questions about policies and procedures . We need to tighten things up an awful lot. &quot; Prison spokesman Kenn I . Hicks said Friday that the staff is still trying to find_out how Brigida , who worked in the kitchen , was able to hide in a waste bin that later was emptied into a garbage_truck . &quot; The bins are in a secured area , &quot; Hicks said . &quot; Anytime trash is put into these bins , that ' s supervised by an officer . Nobody puts anything in there without being supervised. &quot; Hicks said Thurman was unavailable for comment regarding the escape . In Sacramento , Bill Gengler , a spokesman for the California Department of Corrections , said that because garbage_trucks have been used for prison escapes elsewhere , the department uses special security measures around the bins . He said he could not explain how the Lancaster escape occurred until the investigation is finished . About six or seven high-security prisoners escape annually from the 27 state_prisons in California , Gengler said . Some prisons have reported two high-security escapes in one year , as happened in Lancaster , he said . Most , however , report no escapes . Gengler added : &quot; Until we know all_the details , we ' re not going_to take any action against the administrators of the prison. &quot; Authorities confirmed Friday that Brigida was arrested in October , 1987 , after two CHP officers spotted him speeding on a stolen motorcycle along the Golden State Freeway north of Castaic . After a 20-mile chase , Brigida was thrown from his motorcycle when it hit a log . When the officers ordered him to stop , he fired a handgun at Officer David Zielsch , striking him in the right cheek . Zielsch recovered and returned to active duty . Brigida fired a second shot that missed the officers before he was wrestled to the ground and arrested . He pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted first-degree murder in 1988 . Escapes_from Lancaster Since its opening in February , 1993 , four inmates have escaped_from the California State_Prison in Lancaster . Here are the incidents : July 2 : Juan Isidro Maestas , 19 , serving a two-year sentence for burglary , and Jesse Adame , 20 , serving a four-year sentence for robbery , walk away from their minimum-security barrack . Adame is arrested two days later in the City of Industry after a carjacking . Maestas is arrested four days after the escape in El Monte , after prison officials receive information that he might be there . Oct . 5 : Convicted murderer Eric Rene Johnson , 23 , serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole , escapes_from the maximum-security unit in the evening . He is spotted about five hours later at a convenience_store parking_lot at 15th Street West and Avenue K , a_few miles from the prison , where he was recaptured . He had climbed over an 8-foot block wall and two 12-foot chain-link fences -- all topped with coiled razor wire -- while two guards were distracted . Jan . 13 : Steven Charles Brigida , 25 , serving a sentence of life plus eight years for attempted murder , auto theft and burglary , stows away in a garbage_truck and is compacted with the trash and dumped into a local landfill . After crying_out_for help , Brigida is turned_over to prison_guards and Los Angeles County sheriff ' s deputies , who take him to the hospital . He had apparently climbed inside a prison garbage bin that was hoisted into the truck and them dumped .</TEXT>
