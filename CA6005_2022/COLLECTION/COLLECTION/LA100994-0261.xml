   <HEADLINE> UPBEAT MESSAGES WON ' T DO , POLITICAL CANDIDATES FIND ; CAMPAIGNS : WITH PUBLIC SO FRUSTRATED AND CYNICAL , OFFICE SEEKERS EXPLOIT LURE OF TRADITIONAL VALUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not long ago , people trying to reelect Gov . Pete Wilson tested two versions of a TV commercial about immigration . One was a mostly positive spot about Wilson ' s goals . The other was mostly an attack on his opponent , Kathleen Brown . Guess which one the test audience loved ? &quot; They saw the negative spot and said . . . ' Oh , powerful. ' It seemed more honest , &quot; said one of the campaign officials involved . It is that kind of year . In the war for hearts and minds on television in this strange and possibly pivotal political season , the public has become so frustrated and cynical that politicians who want to run positive messages find they don ' t work . &quot; People don ' t believe anything good about politicians , and they are ready to believe almost anything bad , &quot; said Republican media consultant Eddie Mahe . From Philadelphia to Phoenix and Boston to San Francisco , &quot; the percentage of negative advertising . . . is the highest it ' s ever been , &quot; Mahe said . &quot; It gets_worse every year , but it ' s never been like this , &quot; agreed Democratic political consultant Jim Margolis . The trend is significant on at least two levels : Because the ads contain messages tested and honed by campaign professionals , they may well serve as a reflection of the electorate ' s mood . Poll after poll have found that voters are even more sour on politicians this year than in 1992 -- when incumbents were swept from office coast to coast . The tone of the ads also means that the image most people have of candidates this year is a negative one , which raises disturbing questions about the likelihood that voters will regain confidence in their political_leaders anytime soon . A survey of dozens of ads and interviews with political professionals provide the following topography of the 1994 campaign : * The star of most Republican advertising in federal races is President Clinton , and in these ads , the No . 1 reason for voting Republican seems to be to avoid sending more people to Washington who think like he does . * Most Democrats don ' t mention their party , don ' t mention their President and instead run_by comparing themselves to their Republican opponents , an approach that is personal rather than ideological -- and also highly negative . * Party identification doesn ' t mean much except in local races . Being a Republican incumbent is almost as scandalous as being a Democratic one . * After Clinton , the No . 2 issue is crime -- partly , say consultants , because the subtext is morality . Crime strikes people as being about right and wrong . * Republicans still find welfare reform is an issue with great resonance among conservatives . Abortion and the death_penalty , however , have faded as issues . * While negative ads are_on the rise , they are rarely straight-out attacks . Instead , they are usually &quot; comparative , &quot; meaning they involve information about both candidates and contrast their positions . For instance , the negative Wilson ad on immigration preferred by the test audience began with Wilson ' s position that illegal immigrants should not receive state benefits . &quot; Kathleen Brown thinks differently , &quot; it said . &quot; She supports continuing state services to illegals and says illegal immigration is not a cause of problems in California. &quot; &quot; There is no appeal_to the straight attack , &quot; said Republican consultant Mike Murphy , whose clients include Gov . John Engler in Michigan and Virginia Senate candidate Oliver L . North . Candidate research has found that three words above all evoke the most meaning for voters this year , said Murphy : &quot; Washington , &quot; &quot; new &quot; and &quot; liberal. &quot; Most candidates around the country running_for federal_office suggest that they know what ' s wrong in Washington , that they possess something new and that the other guy is liberal -- or , in the case of Democratic candidates , that they themselves are moderate , rather than liberal . And what messages are working best for Democrats ? &quot; Zero , &quot; Margolis said . &quot; I ' m still looking , &quot; said another consultant . &quot; But don ' t use my name. &quot; After several seconds of rueful laughter , Democratic consultant Don Sweitzer answered , &quot; None. &quot; The best approach many Democrats have found is to suggest that the Republican opponent is simply unacceptable . &quot; If you can make the race a choice between two individuals , then you have a shot to hang_on , &quot; Sweitzer said . One of the few Democratic campaign professionals who seems upbeat is Frank Greer , whose firm still expects to win about half of its races , all_of them incumbents . Many of Greer ' s campaigns are geared to defining his Democratic clients as moderate and their Republican rivals as extreme . In Florida , Democratic Gov . Lawton Chiles is using testimonials from Republicans who favor abortion rights to depict opponent Jeb Bush as politically extreme and interested in intruding government into people ' s private lives because of his desire to ban abortion . In Maryland , Democrat Parris Glendening is running_for governor as a &quot; mainstream moderate , &quot; depicting Republican Ellen Sauerbrey as an extremist because she opposed banning assault weapons . &quot; I think we have a formula to stop the right-wing , &quot; Greer said . &quot; A lot of these conservative candidates say they ' re for cutting taxes and spending , but their real agenda is social -- banning abortion and ruining public education in favor of private schools. &quot; In the hands of some Democrats , this effort to carve out the political mainstream can get awfully harsh . Freshman Democratic Rep . Mike Kreidler of Washington state has a new ad about his Republican challenger , Randy Tate : &quot; In Randy Tate ' s world , women will have no reproductive choices , worse health_care security , no protection from fanatic murderers like ( anti-abortion activist ) Paul Hill , fewer options when they are battered or raped , less help when they are pregnant and less help with raising their children. &quot; By comparison , Republicans have an easy job , Democratic operatives moan . Hang Bill_Clinton around the Democrat ' s neck . For example , in Wyoming ' s Senate_race , Republican Rep . Craig Thomas attacks Gov . Mike Sullivan by having former Defense_Secretary Dick Cheney offer this testimonial on camera : &quot; Bill_Clinton ' s proposals . . . have been a disaster for our nation . We simply cannot afford to send another friend of Bill_Clinton ' s to Washington. &quot; One of the most popular techniques in TV ads has been to &quot; morph &quot; a Democratic rival into Clinton -- employing special_effects to have the rival candidate ' s face change into the President ' s . In Alabama , Lt . Gov . Don Siegelman is morphed into Clinton . In Michigan , Democratic Rep . Bob Carr is morphed into Democratic Sen . Donald W . Riegle Jr. , and then linked to Clinton . Candidates in both parties are running ads about values and morality and a sense of lost social moorings . In California , Rep . Mike Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) , the GOP ' s Senate candidate , has an ad in which he holds_up &quot; The Book of Virtues , &quot; former Education_Secretary William J . Bennett ' s best-seller . Democratic Sen . Jim Sasser in Tennessee talks_about lost values in America with voters standing around a pickup . But most candidates are more subtle , seeking_out issues in which morality is a subtext . In Virginia , North talks_about how he knows &quot; what ' s wrong with Washington and what ' s right with Virginia. &quot; It is word for word what Republican Dirk Kempthorne said to get elected to the Senate from Idaho in 1992 , using the same consultant , Murphy . George W . Bush ' s ads in the Texas governor ' s race end with the tagline , &quot; Take a stand_for Texas values . Bush for governor. &quot; Although Democratic officeholders are suffering the most this year , Republican lawmakers also find themselves forced to address the backlash against incumbency . Mahe says he tells his clients to write him a speech as if they were running as a challenger . It becomes the basis of the advertising . For Democrats like Sweitzer , the difficulty Republican incumbents are having suggests that the resentment is not so_much party oriented or even strictly ideological . The problem instead is incumbency and status_quo . &quot; It is amazing how for challengers , the Democratic drag isn ' t as deep. &quot; &quot; I don ' t think I ' ve mentioned party at all_in any campaign , &quot; said Don Sipple , a consultant whose clients often occupy the Republican center , like Wilson in California or Gov . Jim Edgar in Illinois . In federal races in particular , Sipple said , a lot of standard Republican issues of the past are gone . &quot; One that has lost a lot of power is taxes and spending . They are just washed_out by over-promising and under-performance. &quot; Indeed , some Democrats think that Republicans may have made a mistake with their &quot; contract with America &quot; plan unveiled recently , which promised to cut taxes and balance the federal budget . Yet if the year is adding_up to trouble for sitting lawmakers , incumbency still has one advantage , consultants believe : &quot; I have five races with incumbents , and I should lose all_of them , &quot; said a Democratic consultant . &quot; But I am going_to win two of them , just because the challengers are new and are making a lot of mistakes . In one , the other guy is wasting all his money on biographical ads , which don ' t work any more . In the other one , the guy has promised not to run any attack ads. &quot;</TEXT>
