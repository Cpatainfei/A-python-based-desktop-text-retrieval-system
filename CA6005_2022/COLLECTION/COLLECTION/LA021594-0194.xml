   <HEADLINE> TOUGH ROAD AHEAD FOR L.A. CHAMBER_ORCHESTRA ; BOARD PRESIDENT CITES AN ' UNPRECEDENTED CONVERGENCE OF ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> These are terrible times for the prestigious Los Angeles Chamber_Orchestra . Kent Twitchell ' s huge mural of its musicians may look very sturdy from the Harbor Freeway , but the organization billing itself as &quot; the orchestra of the 21st Century &quot; has been battered by the city ' s economy , riots and earthquakes alike . As the orchestra celebrates its 25th anniversary , it does so with nearly empty coffers . Concert-goers found last weekend ' s concerts at Royce Hall and Ambassador Auditorium were &quot; deferred &quot; until spring , while management scrambles to restructure the season , come_up with a replacement for quake-damaged Royce Hall and work_out credit arrangements with musicians and other creditors . Staff and salaries have already been trimmed within the institution ' s $ 2.3-million budget , and creditors gathered on Friday to hear management ' s plea to hold_off action . Orchestra members last week voted to accept a diminished concert and rehearsal schedule for the rest of the season , and their union on Monday was set to file a grievance for back wages and benefits . &quot; We faced an unprecedented convergence of economic and environmental issues , &quot; said board president Jennifer Diener . &quot; The growth of audiences and gifts simply didn ' t keep pace with the orchestra ' s growth. &quot; At stake is a high-quality , well-known musical_group that has long been attracting subscribers and others to concerts at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena , the Japan America Theatre downtown and UCLA ' s Royce Hall on the Westside . Drawing heavily on Los Angeles ' studio musician pool , the orchestra has made 26 recordings and toured both domestically and internationally . &quot; When I hear about this , my heart sinks , &quot; said Deborah Rutter Card , the chamber_orchestra ' s executive_director until fall , 1992 , when she left for the same post at the Seattle Symphony . &quot; I hear orchestras across the country , and I know the Los Angeles Chamber_Orchestra is among the very best . I am very distraught by the idea that the chamber_orchestra would not exist. &quot; Formed in 1969 , L.A. Chamber_Orchestra usually presents 15 to 40 musicians , depending_on what they ' re playing , and performs world_premieres of new work as well as more traditional Mozart and Beethoven concertos and symphonies . Like so many arts and other organizations , the orchestra grew and prospered through the ' 80s , adding subscribers , halls and patrons . In 1991 , the board hired German conductor Christof Perick as its fourth music_director , following prior leaders Neville Marriner , Gerard Schwarz and Iona Brown . Then came all sorts of disasters . First the economy deteriorated , and giving patterns changed . Contributed income started sliding , Diener said , and by the end of last year had dropped to about $ 1 million from $ 1.5 million just two years earlier . Next came the 1992 riots , which knocked_out two concerts downtown during curfew nights and changed traffic_patterns enough that orchestra officials claim their Japan America audiences never returned to former levels . Concerts were postponed , and deficits were increasing . &quot; If people are out_of_work and have their houses shaken by declining real_estate values or earthquakes , it puts a crimp in their serious outside interests , &quot; said former board_member Nicholas Ciriello , the businessman who is leading efforts to reorganize the orchestra , &quot; whether ( those people are ) attending or supporting these events. &quot; Fund-raising is crucial for performing arts organizations like the Los Angeles Chamber_Orchestra , whose ticket income in no way covers costs . Even if you sell_out an all-Vivaldi concert , says Ciriello , &quot; you don ' t make money . You just lose less. &quot; The orchestra ' s subscribers today number about 2 # 800 , more_than double the 1 # 300 subscribers of the 1986-87 season , and most of what they hear is different from that offered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic or other local ensembles . &quot; A city like Los Angeles should be able to afford two orchestras , and ( L.A. Chamber_Orchestra ) is a fantastic chamber_orchestra , &quot; said Ernest Fleischmann , the Philharmonic ' s executive_vice_president and managing director . &quot; Its hitting really hard_times reflects badly on a city like L.A. , which perhaps doesn ' t deserve the musical riches it ' s got. &quot; One problem , of course , is who will pay_for those riches . Fund-raising that was already tough for arts groups in a deteriorating local economy got_even tougher when riots and earthquakes increased the number of people and organizations needing aid . Deficits at Los Angeles Chamber_Orchestra went from about $ 100 # 000 in fiscal ' 91 to an accumulated $ 465 # 000 debt the following year , said Diener . That number climbed to $ 600 # 000 in its fiscal_year ended June 30 , 1993 , and totaled nearly $ 1 million by January , 1994 . This is not the first time the institution has deferred concerts either . Financially troubled before , although apparently not to this extent , the chamber_orchestra indefinitely postponed three programs last season , for instance . Executive_director Erich Vollmer said the orchestra is likely to eliminate its concerts at Japan America , which represents about a sixth of its audience ( compared to 50 % at Ambassador and the remaining third at Royce ) . But neither executives nor board_members indicate concern their nomadic existence is a problem . Nobody , however , is denying assorted internal problems . For one thing , while Rutter Card left for the Seattle Symphony post in November , 1992 , Vollmer was not hired until last February to succeed her . In what one orchestra member refers to as &quot; naivete , not malice , &quot; the organization also got_behind in crucial payments . While Vollmer declines to identify the person responsible , he said he discovered last November that regular_payments were not being made to some state , federal and union agencies beginning in the last_quarter of 1992 . Once the discovery was made , said Vollmer , management notified the state , IRS and others and &quot; affected a payment plan. &quot; Vollmer and Lewis Levy , counsel for Musicians ' Union Local 47 here , say the orchestra and the union will meet to discuss two unmet payrolls as well as delinquent contributions to union pension and other funds . * There has been a cash shortage at Los Angeles Chamber_Orchestra for about nine months , Vollmer said . The orchestra ' s bank reduced its credit_line , he said , and they lost a major grant when a key funder changed its giving emphasis . Another key funder postponed grant action from fall to spring . The orchestra ' s tiny staff of 10 lost one position , the development director , and remaining staff salaries were cut 5 % . A press_release dated Feb . 7 announced that board_members pledged $ 150 # 000 , and two anonymous donors pledged an additional $ 100 # 000 a year for five years &quot; contingent upon a satisfactory financial plan and matching commitments of $ 150 # 000 a year in additional funding. &quot; The board is also &quot; actively seeking angels , &quot; said president Diener , who estimates she ' s talking with about two_dozen potential major donors . The orchestra is also trying to find a new hall to replace Royce in April for the American premiere of the restored Charlie Chaplin silent film classic &quot; The Gold_Rush &quot; ; the chamber_orchestra was set to accompany the film with its original score as a major orchestra fund-raiser . Postponed concerts have tentatively been rescheduled for late April , Vollmer said , but finances could indeed affect programming changes as well . Schoenberg ' s Chamber Symphony No . 2 , Op . 38 , requires two or three extra rehearsals , conductor Perick said , and may be replaced to save extra rehearsal costs . Meanwhile , concerts set for Feb . 24 and Feb . 27 at Ambassador Auditorium will go_on as planned , according to an orchestra spokesman . The Feb . 25 concert at Japan America Theatre has been canceled , he said , and ticket holders are being asked to exchange their tickets for the Ambassador concerts . The remainder of the season is still being discussed , and they hope to announce plans by the end of the week , he said . Talks continue too with musicians and other creditors . While only eight of 118 creditors notified about last Friday ' s meeting actually attended , Vollmer said those attending agreed to wait for their money until July , and approved of the orchestra telling other creditors of their agreement with encouragement to do the same . The orchestra ' s bank had already agreed to wait through June 30 , he adds . &quot; We ' re very hopeful that it will all work_out and the orchestra go_ahead and continue , &quot; said violinist Jennifer Woodward , chair of the orchestra committee and a 14-year Los Angeles Chamber_Orchestra veteran . &quot; We love the orchestra a lot , and we feel it ' s very valuable for the community. &quot;</TEXT>
