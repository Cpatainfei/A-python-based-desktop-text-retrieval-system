   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; PUNJAB ' S LAWLESS POLICE ; OFFICERS WERE GIVEN ENORMOUS LEEWAY TO QUELL THE SIKH SEPARATIST UPRISING IN NORTHWEST INDIA . BUT EVEN AFTER THE GOVERNMENT GAINED THE UPPER_HAND , CITIZENS STILL FACE OFFICIAL ACTS OF TERROR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a country road lined with bougainvillea in flaming bloom , Sukhwinder Singh Bhatti ' s abductors , perspiring in the heat of a Punjab summer , laid their trap . It was 4:30 p.m. when the bus carrying their quarry home from work moved_into view . Two men in civilian clothes clutching light machine_guns motioned it to stop and made five men get_off . Identifying the portly , bushy-bearded Sikh attorney among them , the gunmen roared away with their prey in a white van whose driver wore a mask . That was May 12 . Bhatti , 43 , hasn ' t been heard from since . His wife , Harcharanjit Kaur , 30 , the mother of their three children , is so sick with worry that her face has turned a cadaverous gray and her eyes have sunk into their orbits . In all likelihood , the Sangrur District Bar Assn . member has been murdered . Fellow attorneys say the same fate befell three other defense_lawyers before him , and one even vanished with his wife and 18-month-old son . More examples of terrorism in violence-weary Punjab ? It depends how one defines the term . As in other recent incidents , the prime suspects are not armed insurgents battling the Indian government , but the police . &quot; There is no rule_of_law in Punjab , &quot; Bhatti ' s wife , wringing thin hands whose nails have been gnawed to the flesh , exclaimed as she wept . &quot; We can count only on God. &quot; Two years after the balance shifted decisively in the authorities ' favor in the war on Sikh separatism , the Punjab populace is reaping a brutal and bloody harvest . Police had been given a virtually free hand to liquidate the militants . Now , like a machine that has escaped_from its inventors , they continue to commit acts of illegal detention , torture , intimidation , murder and extortion . Elected officials and the courts seem powerless to stop them . &quot; They ' ve created a monster , and now they are finding it difficult to control , &quot; a local journalist says . For more_than a decade , a rebellion launched by often vicious extremists from the Sikh religious and ethnic minority raged in this flat , canal-laced land of rice , wheat and sunflower fields on India ' s northwest border . As recently as 1991 , the struggle for a separate Sikh state was claiming nearly 5 # 000 lives a year . To liquidate the separatist danger in India ' s breadbasket , the government embarked_on a ruthless counterinsurgency campaign . Police began to kill any militant they caught , rather than turning suspects over to courts cowed by the extremists . Now &quot; the black period is over , &quot; Punjab ' s chief minister , Beant Singh , said earlier this year , proclaiming victory over the rebels . In one sense , he is undeniably right . In industrialized Ludhiana , the Indian state ' s largest city , alcohol-lubricated engagement parties and blue_jeans for girls are back in_vogue as people ignore the fundamentalists ' ascetic fiats of the past . After sundown , traffic again roars along roads , and farmers drive teams of oxen through fields they once fled at dusk . In 1992 , when militants ordered an election boycott , only 20 % of voters turned_out . In partial elections in May , three times that percentage voted . By Singh ' s estimate , only 12 to 13 &quot; hard-core militants &quot; remain at_large , and most of them have fled Punjab . But police conduct continues to vary from the grisly to the outrageous , according to press accounts and interviews with dozens of victims and witnesses . Last December , four village women who went_to Amritsar , seat of the holiest Sikh shrine , were illegally taken into custody , and the word jebkatri -- pickpocket -- was tattooed on their foreheads . The women were obviously simple country folk who had nothing to do with either politics or crime , their lawyer says . Police so clearly exceeded the bounds of permissible behavior that the Punjab High_Court ordered the women awarded 50 # 000 rupees ( $ 1 # 620 ) in compensation , and New Delhi authorities launched a criminal investigation . It was an all-too-rare instance of errant police_officers here being held accountable for their deeds . &quot; In Punjab , there is rule_of_law on the statute_books only , &quot; lawyeS . Gill , chairman of the Ludhiana-based International Human_Rights Organization , a non-governmental monitoring group , charges . &quot; Police have instructions to eliminate people who were directly or indirectly involved in the ( separatist ) movement : militants , relatives and sympathizers , religious figures. &quot; Also at risk , he says , are people who try to monitor human_rights abuses and attorneys who represent accused terrorists . Even being married to the wrong person may be dangerous . In June , 1993 , police dragged 40-year-old Gurnam Kaur by the hair from her Ludhiana home , clubbing her with rifle_butts . It later became clear that they were really seeking her husband , who is accused of being the brains behind the militant Babbar Khalsa International group . The husband was arrested later in Delhi , police announced . But his wife never resurfaced , although the Indian Supreme Court ' s registrar ordered Punjab police to hold an inquiry and report &quot; immediately. &quot; Her sister-in-law fears that Kaur was tortured to death by police in the town of Tarn Taran and her body dumped in the Beas River . The case of Bhatti , a member of a separatist political_party who served as legal counsel to Sikhs accused of terrorism , depicts in miniature how Punjab ' s police seem to be able to act at will . He was abducted 100 yards from a police checkpoint west of Sangrur , one reason many people believe police were responsible . Another is the criminal complaint that Bhatti had filed on behalf of an old_man tortured in police custody . The plaintiff , Baldev Singh , is 74 . In July , 1993 , he says , he was picked_up by police , stripped naked , trussed up with a rope and hung upside down from the ceiling of a police_station . He was beaten with bamboo poles on the soles of his feet until he blacked_out . Next , Singh says , police crushed his thighs beneath a heavy wooden roller . They asked him if he had been providing shelter to Sikh militants . No , he maintained . Again he lost_consciousness . The torture was repeated for a second day . On the third day , he was freed . He had to be driven_home because he couldn ' t walk . On orders from the Sangrur magistrate , three doctors examined Singh and corroborated that he had been tortured . Bhatti filed a legal complaint on his behalf . &quot; Police officials were threatening Mr. Bhatti and me to withdraw the case , &quot; Singh now says . &quot; They said we ' d be eliminated. &quot; Outraged by the mysterious disappearance of yet another lawyer , Punjab High_Court Judge V . K . Bali gave police until June 3 to produce Bhatti . But police showed_up in court empty-handed , saying they had searched extensively and had no idea where he was . Indian officialdom routinely rejects allegations of human_rights violations in Punjab and other troubled areas of the country . The charismatic chief of the Punjab police , K . P . S . Gill , who is universally credited with crushing the insurgency , has categorically denied accusations of police brutality and killings . During his visit to Washington in May , Indian Prime_Minister P . V . Narasimha Rao assured a joint session of Congress that his government was &quot; taking scrupulous care &quot; to protect human_rights , and he invited members of the Senate to go see the situation in Punjab for themselves . Crisscrossing the dusty , sunbaked farmlands watered by tributaries of the Indus , one hears stories that are at_odds with the reassuring statements of officials . Such testimony portrays police and paramilitary forces subject_to no real judicial or governmental oversight . It seems to make a farce of the slogan painted on red-and-blue police checkpoints that promises the Punjab populace &quot; protection with affection. &quot; &quot; I ' ve come_across no case where a prosecution against the guilty official was won , &quot; R . S . Maha , a Sangrur lawyer , says . &quot; And the victim remains the victim. &quot; In a study of alleged shootouts between militants and police in Punjab , the international human_rights organization Amnesty International noted that in 169 such &quot; encounters &quot; reported in the state ' s press , 266 purported Sikh separatists were killed , but not a single police_officer . In a report released during Rao ' s U.S. visit , Human_Rights Watch / Asia and Physicians for Human_Rights put the death toll in Punjab ' s decade-long insurgency at more_than 10 # 000 , charging that most of the victims were summarily executed in police custody . The case of Harpal Singh , 40 , seems all too typical . Acquitted on terrorism charges last July , the agricultural worker was arrested the next day . Police , however , denied detaining him . A few days later , they announced that a militant armed with an AK-47 had been slain in an &quot; encounter &quot; near the village of Maheru . The doctor who performed the autopsy confirmed to Singh ' s father that the dead man was his son . But it was a strange gunfight . The post-mortem showed he had been shot point-blank in the forehead twice with a pistol . Supposedly armed with a fast-firing assault_rifle , he hurt no one . &quot; Nobody has ever been killed in a fake ambush , &quot; Punjab Chief Minister Singh has asserted . As for accusations of official brutality , he claims that during his more_than two years in office , about 200 police_officers have been punished for one offense or another . However , a recent occurrence in Chandigarh , Punjab ' s capital , casts doubt on the official version of events . In March , police_chief Gill summoned the press to witness the &quot; surrender &quot; of a celebrated ideologue of the separatist movement , Kanwar Singh Dhami . The news_conference rapidly deviated from its organizers ' plans when the badly limping speaker announced that he had been held illegally and incommunicado by police for 10 months , along with his pregnant wife and 6-year-old son . Dhami told reporters that he had been severely tortured and warned while in custody that his family would be wiped_out if he didn ' t &quot; surrender &quot; to Gill before the press . After the uncooperative speaker was bundled_off by police , Gill said he was obviously deranged . A particularly gruesome &quot; encounter slaying &quot; in the town of Patti also has bared official misdeeds . Police in October left a body at the Civil Hospital , asking that an autopsy be performed . Sarabjit Singh ' s head was bathed in blood , witnesses remember ; he had been shot in the back of the skull with a small-caliber gun . When the corpse began to talk , the hospital staff was flabbergasted . Singh , it turned_out , wasn ' t dead but was severely wounded . The entry hole left by the bullet was dressed , and he was given injections and intravenous glucose . Then , Sita Ram , a police_officer , returned . He grabbed Singh by the arms and legs and tossed him into a patrol vehicle , witnesses said . An hour later , the police were back . Again , they wanted a post-mortem performed . This time , Singh was truly dead . The case appears to be one of the very few in Punjab where a police_officer may be punished for the use of excessive force , leading some to hope that officials of the government and courts are trying harder to rein_in police . Ram is in jail pending trial . But at the hospital , the doctor who treated Singh is afraid to discuss the case for fear that Ram ' s fellow officers may take revenge . Securing a murder_conviction may be impossible . Under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities ( Prevention ) Act , a terrorism suspect in India can be held for up_to two years without trial . Ludhiana human_rights activist and lawyer Gill estimates that some Sikhs have been in jail for up_to four years without having been convicted of any crime or even having gone_to court . His organization , which has undisguised sympathy for the separatist struggle , has estimated that 7 # 000 to 8 # 000 activists , relatives and sympathizers are languishing in Indian jails , often in custody illegally . When quizzed earlier this year , Chief Minister Singh maintained that only 800 to 900 &quot; terrorists &quot; were in jail . Events in Punjab have much wider implications because police techniques pioneered there are being extended_to other troubled areas of India , including the state of Jammu and Kashmir . It was announced in May , for instance , that the new post of superintendent of police for operations would be created in districts of Kashmir where Muslim insurgents are particularly active . According to some Punjab human_rights activists , the holder of this job is in_charge of faking the deaths of detainees in &quot; encounters. &quot; Police_chief Gill has also admitted that police hit teams have been created in Punjab to &quot; trace , identify and kill top militants &quot; instead of arresting them . In May , 1993 , one squad went all_the way to Calcutta to shoot dead an alleged militant and his wife . Two weeks ago , nine police assassins went_to West Bengal to kill another alleged terrorist . Local authorities were so infuriated that they disarmed the Punjab officers and barred them from leaving until an investigation is complete . Punjab police showed their colors again this month at a New Delhi press_conference called after their chief was chosen head of India ' s field_hockey federation . When a pair of journalists cast doubt on Gill ' s qualifications for the job , they were hustled out by five high-ranking Punjab officers and given a thrashing . Indian authorities ' biggest break_in their fight against armed Sikh militancy came_in February , 1993 , when Gurbachan Singh Manochahal , chief of the underground committee that had been spearheading the Sikh separatist struggle , was gunned_down after emerging from a bunker hidden beneath a cowshed . In a poor farming village near Tarn Taran , the dead militant ' s sister-in-law is struggling to get_by . &quot; We have no peace , &quot; Kashmir Kaur complains . Police seized the sprawling farmhouse occupied by the family , she says . How many members of her family are still alive ? Kaur pauses to think . Gurbachan ' s mother and father disappeared following their detention by police , she says . The same thing happened to two of his four brothers . In all , she concludes , 10 family members have vanished or been killed while in the custody of Punjab police . &quot; The peace they talk_about has been built_on the bones of my relatives , &quot; Kaur says .</TEXT>
