   <HEADLINE> MENTAL WORKOUTS MAY AID HEALTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Studying and discussing ideas may have something to do with people ' s physical as well as mental_health . Recently , scientists have suggested that exercising the intellect helps keep older people healthy . Some of the most dramatic evidence has come from a study of elderly nuns done_by the University of Kentucky . The School Sisters of Notre Dame , a Catholic order numbering more_than 670 women , agreed to donate their brains for post-mortem examination and allowed researchers to review their lifetime health records . The subjects of the study come from two groups of nuns in seven U.S. cities , teachers and domestic workers . Dr. David Snowden has been evaluating the participants every year for nearly a decade . He believes higher levels of mental activity appear to be related to longevity with good mental and physical functioning . One of the oldest subjects , a 102-year-old nun , was alert and functioning well until the day she died , with no symptoms of serious illness . But an autopsy revealed that her brain was riddled with Alzheimer ' s disease . She was one of the most intellectually active members of the order . &quot; Scientific findings show that exercise , weightlifting and other physical activities help people maintain the functions they need to maintain their independence , &quot; Snowden says . &quot; would n ' t it be nice if brain_cells turned_out to behave like muscle_cells -- that if you keep mentally active , your brain will function optimally for a longer time. &quot;</TEXT>
