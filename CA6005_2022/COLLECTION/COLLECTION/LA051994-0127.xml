   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : OLAJUWON TRIES TO PUT FEAR OF GOD IN ' HYPOCRITE ' AINGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets regards Danny Ainge of the Phoenix Suns as an annoying mosquito . &quot; He plays little games , &quot; Olajuwon told Chris Jenkins of the San Diego Union-Tribune . &quot; Danny pulls you down , tries to trip you , throws the ball at you and then he pretends to be reasonable . &quot; He tries to fool people . He pretends to be a nice guy . When you do that , you are a hypocrite . I would advise him to be God-fearing. &quot; Ainge clone ? Scott Hastings , a former NBA player and now a broadcaster for the Denver Nuggets , told the Rocky Mountain News that guard John Stockton of the Utah Jazz is &quot; one of the dirtiest players in the league. &quot; &quot; He ' s the Danny Ainge of the ' 90s , without the reputation. &quot; Trivia time : What was Larry Brown ' s coaching record at UCLA in 1979-80 and 1980-81 ? P.R. coach : Buddy Ryan , Arizona Cardinal coach , told Jack Magruder of the Arizona Daily Star of the adjustment Barry Switzer must make as the new Dallas Cowboy coach : &quot; He didn ' t coach much at Oklahoma . If he would have been hired on as a position coach , a linebacker coach , or something , ( the Cowboys ) would have been in_trouble . &quot; In his system the assistant coaches do a lot of the coaching , anyway . He ' ll do the people part of it just fine. &quot; Add Switzer : While coaching at Oklahoma in the mid-1970s , Switzer said he was once offered the head coaching_job with the Kansas City Chiefs . &quot; I told them I had more first-round draft choices on my team than they did , &quot; Switzer said . Wrong juice : Before he snapped out of a hitting slump , the Pirates ' Andy Van Slyke said : &quot; Everybody ' s talking_about the ball being juiced . The balls I ' ve been hitting have prune juice in them. &quot; Time_machine : Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune criticized the Lakers ' hiring of Del Harris as their coach : &quot; So the Lakers have gone from slicked-back Showtime to blue-haired Vaudeville . The ' 90s look . . . the 1890s . Instead of the Laker girls , they should bring_in a barbershop quartet. &quot; M &amp; M ' s : Dikembe Mutombo of the Denver Nuggets changed his autograph to DM -- 55 because he feared writer ' s cramp . He never considered signing his full name : Dikembe Mutombo Mpolondo Mukamba Jean Jacque Wamutombo . Just wondering : Mike Lupica of Newsday wrote : &quot; How come Michael Jordan is a threat to baseball and the A.L. West isn ' t ? &quot; He has been around : Oriole closer Lee Smith told the Baltimore Sun that he doesn ' t find extra motivation in facing the Red Sox and the Yankees , two of his former teams , in the same week . &quot; If that was the case , I ' d be pumped up every place I went , &quot; Smith said . &quot; I ' ve played near everywhere. &quot; FYI : The shortest hole played in a major golf championship is the 107-yard , par-three seventh hole at Pebble Beach . Trivia answer : Brown ' s two-year record was 42-17 . Quotebook : Minnesota Twin pitcher Jim Deshaies , on juiced baseballs : &quot; I think a small band of owners broke_into Fred MacMurray ' s basement and stole the formula for Flubber. &quot; MAL FLORENCE</TEXT>
