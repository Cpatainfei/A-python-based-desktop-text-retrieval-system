   <HEADLINE> ONE CREEK AT A TIME , OREGON IS RESTORING SALMON HABITAT ; ENVIRONMENT : THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY HAS IDENTIFIED 213 WEST COAST RUNS OF SALMON , STEELHEAD AND SEA RUN CUTTHROAT TROUT THAT ARE IN DANGER OF EXTINCTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Walking along the South Fork of Little Butte Creek , fish biologist Jerry Vogt didn ' t have to look far to find evidence of how man has made_it tough for salmon to survive . Mounds of gravel along the creek bank showed where bulldozers plowed out the channel after the devastating flood of 1964 , turning the Rogue River tributary into more of a gutter than a spawning bed for coho_salmon . &quot; People like things neat and tidy and clean . Fish and wildlife like things messy , &quot; said Vogt , who works for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in White City . One creek at a time , Vogt and others are messing things up . They are under the gun . Three runs of Pacific salmon already have been protected under the Endangered Species Act and more are_on the way . Environmentalists petitioned to protect coho_salmon runs ; they plan to file a petition to protect winter steelhead soon . The American Fisheries Society has identified 213 West Coast runs of salmon , steelhead and sea run cutthroat trout that are in danger of extinction . The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife blames the coho ' s predicament on a lack of food in the ocean , where salmon grow to be adults . The department has warned commercial salmon fishermen they probably won ' t be able to troll for coho next summer . &quot; Unless there ' s a last-minute miracle , it ' s harder and harder to find any optimism , &quot; said Bernie Bohn , harvest manager for the department . Historically , government_agencies have dealt with declining salmon runs_by cutting_back on fishing and boosting production from hatcheries . &quot; that ' s just rearranging deck_chairs on the Titanic , &quot; said Glen Spain of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen ' s Assn. , which represents commercial fishermen . &quot; The habitat issue is the real issue . I ' m real concerned that we are not pro-active on habitat protection. &quot; &quot; The salmon is the preeminent indicator species , because it starts at the top of the watershed , goes all through the watershed , into the estuaries and out_to the ocean and returns again , &quot; Spain said . &quot; As the salmon go_down , it ' s a clear warning_bell that we have destroyed most of the integrity of our watersheds. &quot; Salmon spawn in Montana , Idaho , Washington , Oregon and California . Until now , most of the effort to boost declining runs has focused_on the series of dams on the Columbia and Snake_rivers , which are blamed for killing millions of young_fish each year as they migrate . The Northwest ' s first endangered species listing of a salmon run was the Snake_River sockeye . More attention is being paid now to restoring habitat that has been damaged by heavy logging , flood_control , cattle grazing and urban development . The Clinton_Administration ' s proposal for lifting the injunctions that have stopped logging_in northern spotted owl habitat includes $ 72 million for assessing , protecting and restoring salmon habitat in national forests . Recognizing that federal lands alone won ' t support the restoration of salmon runs and other wildlife , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is encouraging big timber companies to develop habitat conservation plans to avoid new endangered species listings . &quot; The list gets longer and longer all_the time and the resources we have to deal with it don ' t keep_up with it , &quot; said Mollie Beattie , director of the Fish and Wildlife Service . The Pacific Rivers Council has estimated that it will cost $ 350 million to restore salmon habitat just on federal lands on the west_side of the Cascade_Range . There is no big fix . It depends_on lots of little fixes , such_as the one on the South Fork of Little Butte Creek , which runs_out of the Rogue River National Forest in the Cascade_Range and connects with its North Fork before emptying into the Rogue River five miles north of Medford . On the edge of the national forest , Vogt and a group of volunteers re-created a little side channel , where juvenile coho can escape the fast water of the creek , hide from predators and find food . The bulldozers that dug_out the creek_bed after the 1964 flood robbed the channel of its water . So Vogt and the volunteers cut_in a culvert and dug a meandering ditch through the flood plain . It ' s full of logs and root wads and alder sticks clipped off by beavers . The remnants of the coho run that survive will spawn this winter in the creek . Vogt hopes to see the side channel full of young_fish this spring . &quot; This creek is still in good_enough shape that we can still get some benefit , &quot; said Vogt . &quot; If we can work our way downstream , we can extend the range of usable habitat in the stream. &quot;</TEXT>
