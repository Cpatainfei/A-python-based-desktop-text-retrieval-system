   <TEXT> The White_House , seeking major budget cutbacks to help pay_for a middle-income tax cut , has directed the Energy_Department to prepare option plans for at least a 20 % reduction in funding and possibly for complete elimination of the agency . Although a civilian agency , the Energy_Department is responsible_for development of the nation ' s nuclear_weapons and for cleaning_up the massive radioactive waste problems that are part of the legacy of the Cold_War . But government sources said the department ' s $ 6-billion environmental management program and its $ 4.3-billion defense_program would be hit hardest by the expected cutbacks . The Energy_Department ' s budget is about $ 18 billion a year , and by no means could all_of that be saved even if the department were abolished . Officials said many of its functions -- including the environmental and weapons programs -- would have to be transferred to other government_agencies if the department were eliminated . Still , with resurgent Republicans vowing to slash taxes for middle-income Americans , President Clinton is under political pressure to come_up with a plan of_his_own -- especially since he made middle-class tax cuts a theme of his 1992 election campaign but shied_away_from the issue as President when faced with the realities of the federal_deficit . Clinton said over the weekend that he would cut taxes on the middle_class if ways can be found to avoid increasing the deficit . That means identifying spending_cuts for existing government programs to offset the revenues lost in a tax cut . Administration officials have talked in terms of a $ 40-billion to $ 50-billion reduction over five years ; the GOP has vowed to enact far larger cuts but has not yet offered details of how it would pay_for them . Vice_President Al Gore and budget officials involved in the search for spending_cuts are scheduled to confer_with Clinton today on the options prepared by various departments . The President apparently will sign_off on some cuts_in time to announce them in a speech he plans to deliver from the Oval Office at 6 p.m. PST Thursday . Assistant Secretary_of_Energy Sue Tierney acknowledged in a news briefing Monday that the department was facing &quot; painful cuts everywhere , &quot; but she declined to give any specifics . &quot; We are looking_at a range of numbers that would take us to really the most bare-bones kind of government functions , in all_of our mission areas from science , national security , energy and environmental management , &quot; Tierney said . Larry J . Haas , an Office of Management and Budget spokesman , declined to comment on the directive to the Energy_Department . He insisted that neither Clinton nor any of his advisers have issued &quot; an across-the-board edict of any kind regarding the size of the department or agency budget_cuts throughout the government. &quot; Clinton &quot; is not targeting any one or any few agencies for dramatic change , but will consider dramatic change in quite a number of different departments and agencies , &quot; Haas said . Several officials confirmed the directive to the Energy_Department , however . Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary has strongly opposed suggestions that her department might be targeted for elimination . Tierney said that O ' Leary welcomes &quot; healthy discussions of whether or not the department ' s missions should be done at the department or somewhere else. &quot; But she said O ' Leary doubted it would &quot; save a lot of money &quot; to transfer the department ' s functions to other agencies . There has been speculation that if the Energy_Department were eliminated , its nuclear weapons-related functions would go_to the Defense_Department . Critics have argued that this would undermine a long-standing bipartisan agreement that stewardship of nuclear stockpiles should rest in civilian hands . An Energy_Department official , who declined to be named , said O ' Leary urged Clinton and his top advisers to put more emphasis on seeking cuts_in &quot; the whole government rather than just willy-nilly eliminating one department. &quot; A 20 % cut_in the department ' s budget , the official said , &quot; will hurt some of the initiatives that President Clinton has considered priorities , such_as environmental cleanup and defense work . It would severely limit our defense role of taking_care of nuclear weapons. &quot; Several interested organizations , after hearing from energy officials that their department might be eliminated , sent letters of protest to Clinton on Monday . &quot; We are writing to urge you in the strongest possible terms not to abolish the Department_of_Energy or transfer its nuclear weapons-related functions to the Department_of_Defense , &quot; wrote Robert Wages , president of the Oil , Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers International Union . The Union of Concerned Scientists declared that abolishing the department would be &quot; a historic mistake &quot; that would put valuable programs at risk &quot; for questionable political or economic benefit. &quot; Nonetheless , the White_House -- caught between the fiscal rock of the federal_deficit and the political hard place of an unhappy electorate -- has little choice but to consider significant spending_cuts . No final_decisions have been made , said a senior White_House official , &quot; but we all know the public remains dissatisfied with how the federal_government works. &quot;</TEXT>
