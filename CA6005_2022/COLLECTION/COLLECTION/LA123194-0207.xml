   <HEADLINE> VICTORIOUS REBEL MUSLIM TAKES FOLLOWERS BACK TO THEIR BIHAC HOME ; BOSNIA : THE RETURN OF FIKRET ABDIC IS A SETBACK FOR THE GOVERNMENT . HIS SUPPORTERS CALL HIM ' DADDY. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A week after renegade Muslim leader Fikret Abdic retook his headquarters in the Bosnian town of Velika Kladusa , a virtual wagon_train of refugees headed_home Friday under the rebel leader ' s wing . In tractors and trucks , buses and horse carts , about 6 # 000 Muslim refugees moved_out of the no-man ' s-land border between Croatian government and Serbian rebel forces , where they had been herded by Abdic four months ago . The mass homecoming is a setback for the Bosnian government and a victory for Abdic , an ally of the Serbs who is one of the more unpredictable characters in the complex Balkans conflict . By persuasion and force , Abdic had prevented the refugees from going_back to Velika Kladusa as long as government troops held the town . But now , Abdic is in_charge again with 4 # 000 to 5 # 000 of_his_own gunmen . &quot; Kladusa is free now . Our soldiers are there , &quot; said Abdic supporter Umikulsuma Beha , an 18-year-old high_school student preparing to leave Turanj , a suburb of Karlovac southwest of Zagreb . &quot; Abdic brings us peace. &quot; Not exactly , but for years Abdic has at least brought bread and jobs to the people of Velika Kladusa , a town in the northern Bihac pocket . Before the war , Babo , or Daddy , as Abdic followers call him , built the Agrokomerc poultry and food-processing empire , Communist Yugoslavia ' s third-largest company with 13 # 000 employees -- including someone from just about every family in Velika Kladusa and the Bihac area . In 1987 , Abdic went_to jail for 18 months over a multimillion-dollar fraud deal involving Agrokomerc , but he emerged a still-popular figure who some say actually won the election for president of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1990 . Abdic gave_way to fellow Muslim Alija Izetbegovic , however , and returned home to his mansion and power base in Velika Kladusa . When war erupted in April , 1992 , Abdic cut deals with anyone and everyone -- Serbs , Croats , Muslims and the United Nations -- to keep his area relatively peaceful and well-supplied . But Abdic began criticizing Izetbegovic as incompetent , and in September , 1993 , he declared autonomy for his region . The government responded with troops , launching a Muslim-against-Muslim conflict in the middle of its war with Bosnian Serbs . In August , the Bosnian government claimed a great victory by driving Abdic out of Velika Kladusa and into exile . Officials had hoped that it would be the decisive battle that would end the internecine fighting . That is when Abdic hustled about 30 # 000 followers into Turanj and another camp at Batnoga in the dangerous zone along the border with Croatia . Many boarded his buses voluntarily ; others who hesitated were warned that Bosnian troops would cut their throats . When the Bosnian government , U.N. officials and even the U.S._government promised the refugees safety in government-controlled Velika Kladusa , Abdic made_sure they stayed_put with persuasion , promises and thugs , according to dissidents in Turanj . &quot; He makes his point with fear , &quot; one detractor said . November ' s Serbian attack on the U.N. &quot; safe area &quot; in Bihac provided Abdic with the chance to make a comeback . He joined forces with his enemy ' s enemy -- Croatian Serbs who are allied_with Bosnian Serbs -- and won Velika Kladusa back from Bosnia ' s government . Then , he accepted a proposal by the top U.N. commander in Bosnia , Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , to respect a cease-fire brokered by former President Jimmy_Carter between the Bosnian government and Bosnian Serbs . The truce freezes the front_lines short of Abdic ' s objectives but allows him to move his people back . The Bihac region is an important road and railroad junction and has been a target for Serbs who would like to link Bosnian Serb-held territory with Croatian Serb-held territory in the eventual formation of a Greater Serbia . Abdic would be a useful ally for them . Western diplomats and political analysts shake their heads in amazement at the mention of Abdic ' s name . &quot; He has created a world of_his_own , &quot; said a Western diplomatic source who asked not to be named . &quot; Abdic is always available to the highest bidder . The Croatian Serbs have armed and reclothed his soldiers . The people are being used as pawns. &quot; * Witting and unwitting pawns . The primitive camp at Turanj is so inhospitable that even a war-torn town could easily look better after four cold months . The refugees have been living_in the chilly basements of houses left in ruins from Croatia ' s 1991 civil_war . The town was abandoned and mined ; the people have no running water or electricity , no beds or bathrooms . Refugee workers and military_police say 6 # 000 people have left Turanj in the past two days in a caravan of Agrokomerc buses and trucks , with possibly hundreds of horses , carts and tractors . &quot; They call us extremists , &quot; said Dzemila Durmic , 31 . Fingering the barbed wire in front of her at the camp ' s perimeter , she began to cry . &quot; Before all_of this , I had property , two horses , nine cows , a tractor . Sometimes you have everything , and then sometimes you don ' t even have clothes to dress in. &quot; More on the Balkans * Look_to the TimesLink on-line service for a special package of background articles on the origins of the Yugoslav civil_war .
