   <HEADLINE> PACIFIC RIM TRADE ; AMERICA ; IN TRADE DEBATES , THE PUBLIC OPTS OUT ; AMERICANS DON ' T OFTEN GET EXCITED ABOUT TRADE_POLICY . TIMES OF ECONOMIC UPHEAVAL CAN STIR THEIR ANGER , THOUGH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As diplomats hammered_out final details of a new_world trade agreement last December in Geneva , hundreds of journalists packed the hall but only a_few were from the United States , the No . 1 trading nation and the one with the most at stake . Completion of the new trade rules under the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade sent 200 # 000 angry Indians into a violent protest in New Delhi . But in America , the trade plan drew scant public interest . Even last fall ' s debate over the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , which strikes close to home , attracted only a_few thousand people to occasional rallies staged by opponents . Pro-NAFTA demonstrations drew even fewer . It would seem that most Americans view trade issues with monumental indifference . Not so . Trade is an issue that is deeply embedded in the nation ' s political landscape . But it is one that remains latent for long periods , surfacing only sporadically , particularly during times of economic upheaval . And even when it tops the national agenda , trade tends to defy traditional political analysis . In trade_policy , like foreign_policy , partisanship stops at the water ' s edge . &quot; Trade is a bipartisan and nonpartisan issue . It is not ideological , &quot; U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in a speech last month . &quot; It would be devastating for this country . . . to make this a partisan issue. &quot; Nevertheless , trade is an issue with a long and colorful history in the United States , and it involves an extensive web of political and economic connections that Presidents , lawmakers and negotiators ignore at their peril . The stiff import tariffs that were applied , under heavy political pressure , at the start of the Great Depression are but one example . The difficulties faced by President Clinton last month as he decided to extend China ' s most-favored-nation trading status , despite a lack of progress by Beijing in addressing human_rights issues , are but the most recent . Political leaders around the world typically express their devotion to the concept of free_trade and endorse the idea of holding quotas , tariffs and other restrictions to an absolute minimum . But their allegiance to free_trade in the abstract often falls by the wayside in the reality of day-to-day politics . For instance , said a congressional staffer actively involved in trade issues , the American people &quot; look elsewhere for the culprit during a period of problems . The last place you will lay blame is yourself. &quot; * In such circumstances , he said , foreign trade offers a ready , if primarily symbolic , response for politicians . When the economy is troubled , they focus blame beyond the nation ' s borders . &quot; It ( trade ) is an issue most other countries deal with on a continuing basis , with pretty much the same intensity , &quot; the official said . But , he said , speaking on condition of anonymity , in the United States it is a subject more often below the surface of public_debate , &quot; so it is primed ( only ) by the political pump. &quot; Thus , when the Clinton_Administration felt a need to &quot; stand_up for the American worker , &quot; Japan ' s trade_policies provided a convenient target in mid-1993 and early 1994 . But , he added , &quot; as the economy has gotten better , there is a waning of interest &quot; in trade relations with Tokyo . A Los Angeles Times poll in April found only five out of 1 # 682 people questioned who volunteered that foreign trade was the most important problem facing the nation . On a day-to-day basis , trade issues may be higher on the political agenda in Europe or Japan than they are in the United States , and therefore may appear open_to more routine handling . In fact , they are no less volatile overseas . It was the political clout of French farmers -- and sympathetic urban voters devoted to the romantic image , if not the reality , of French rural life -- that for years blocked approval of the agricultural provisions in the recent GATT round . In Japan , Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa left_office in April amid criticism of his failure to strike a new trade agreement with the United States . It wasn ' t the sole factor_in his departure , but it played a contributing role . In the United States , partisan divisions over trade issues are rare . For instance , Clinton found support among Republicans and Democrats alike as he fought successfully for congressional approval of NAFTA last fall , affirming American acceptance of more open trade among the United States , Mexico and Canada . Do such alliances mean a trade negotiator can ignore congressional crosswinds and the interests of constituencies in writing a trade agreement ? Of course not , said one former negotiator , adding : &quot; I was as attentive as I could conceivably be. &quot; Some issues are less likely to attract the political spotlight . Intellectual property_rights -- the protection , for example , of U.S. patents guarding biotechnology products -- &quot; never resonate with anyone other_than a small community &quot; in Congress , said one trade expert . But when trade disputes are linked to volatile public issues -- such_as human_rights in China , the opening of Japanese markets to U.S. products and Clinton ' s willingness to open diplomatic and trade relations with Vietnam -- they &quot; clearly have grass-roots resonance , grass-roots understanding and grass-roots impact , &quot; the trade specialist said . At the heart of the Administration ' s decisions on these difficult issues , said Claude Barfield , a trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute , is this question : &quot; How can we do the right thing without taking a lot of flak ? &quot; &quot; Producers and workers threatened by imports tend to be concentrated , organized and ready and able to press their interests in the political_arena . Those who benefit from trade are diffuse , and their stake in any particular trade matter is usually small , &quot; I . M . Destler wrote in &quot; American Trade Politics , &quot; a highly regarded study first published in 1983 and revised in 1992 . * Last year ' s NAFTA debate was a remarkable exception . Supporters who stressed the potential long-range gains from increased exports to Mexico were able to prevail over those concerned about the more immediate impact of Mexican products competing with higher-cost goods made in U.S. factories . There usually is an imbalance , Destler wrote , between those riding an economic wave and those being swamped by it . &quot; Firms with expanding markets and ample profits tend to concentrate_on business ; their worry is that government may get_in their way by placing constraints on their flexibility and their profits , &quot; he pointed_out . &quot; It is the embattled losers in trade who go_into politics to seek trade protection. &quot; So , he said , quoting a former trade official , it is an &quot; unnatural act &quot; for a politician to vote to lower trade_barriers , particularly in the face of well-organized interests seeking quotas on imports or higher tariffs to protect a local industry . While the economy provided the text for the 1992 presidential campaign , trade -- and the role of lower trade_barriers -- offered an important subtext . Throughout the campaign , then-President George_Bush tried to use his own support for NAFTA , which removes trade_barriers among the United States , Mexico and Canada , as a weapon against challenger Clinton . Clinton waited until October , one month before the election , to tackle the sensitive issue , and then offered only his conditional support . Since the election , Clinton aides have noted that it would have been much easier for their candidate to gain support in America ' s industrial heartland , where NAFTA was unpopular , had he openly opposed the agreement . Which brings us back to Geneva , and the negotiations to rewrite the rules that have governed international trade since the end of World_War_II . In the closing days of the GATT talks , negotiators were meeting nearly 24 hours a day . Even so , a senior aide in the U.S. delegation managed to find time each day to make his way to a meeting room at the Intercontinental Hotel . There , he sat with a team of lobbyists representing such diverse segments of the U.S. economy as agriculture , entertainment , textiles , steel and pharmaceuticals , delivering a classified briefing on the latest developments in the negotiations . There was nothing nefarious about it . Nor , officials said , were the lobbyists given insider_information . Rather , the briefers were simply recognizing an unavoidable fact of life in the world of trade and politics : When the world trade pact was completed , the lobbyists would return to Washington . Without their support , the Administration would stand little chance of winning congressional approval of the pact .</TEXT>
