   <HEADLINE> QUAKE SEEN SPEEDING RECOVERY OF ECONOMY ; REBUILDING : $ 15 BILLION IN INSURANCE PAYOUTS AND AID PROVIDES STIMULUS FOR AREA . LONG-TERM EFFECT IS UNCLEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Call it shock_therapy : Earthquake rebuilding efforts are about to breathe new life into Southern California ' s battered economy , as disaster relief money showers_down on an army of builders , repair companies , retailers and suppliers . Remarkably , some economists now expect the quake to speed_up the region ' s recovery rather than push it back into 1995 , as_many had feared in the chaotic days after Jan . 17 . The fuel : $ 15 billion in insurance checks and disaster aid -- in_effect an economic stimulus program aimed at the heart of Los Angeles . &quot; It filters through the economy in an amazing way , &quot; said Morton O . Schapiro , chairman of USC ' s economics_department . The Sherman Oaks resident said the earthquake has provided his family a do-it-yourself lesson in the economics of disasters . &quot; We replaced a TV . We replaced two VCRs . We spent a_thousand dollars to get our car fixed . We built a new fence . And I don ' t think we ' re the only ones. &quot; From earthquakes to blizzards , floods to tornadoes , natural disasters obviously take a toll on wealth as well as nerves . Work_time is lost forever . Rattled residents move away . Businesses are wiped_out . Tourists go elsewhere . Job gains in Southern California may be slightly lower in the future , when the rebuilding wave winds down around 1996 . Yet seven weeks after the Northridge earthquake sparked fears of regional paralysis , the surprise is that Southern California ' s economy is not faring worse . Sky-high estimates of up_to $ 30 billion in damage have been slashed to $ 13.5 billion in a new UCLA study . Freeway repairs in Los Angeles are proceeding much more rapidly than in the Bay Area after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake . Federal money is coursing through the pipeline from Washington . &quot; The irony of it is that this bad event that created a lot of hardship is going_to start an economic expansion about a year before it would have happened otherwise , &quot; said private economist Mark Zandi , who expects a recovery this summer , based on his analysis of Hurricane Andrew and other disasters on their regions . Already , new signs of economic life are emerging , as the shell-shocked aftermath of disaster evolves into a phase of methodical rebuilding . Property_owners , still awaiting insurance payments , now are calling contractors and beginning to plan major renovations and repairs . &quot; The increase in calls and estimates is tremendous , &quot; said Mike Quiroga , owner of Mike ' s Roofing Service in Van Nuys , who expects business to leap as much as 75 % this year . &quot; We ' re going to be busy in the next 30 to 45 days , &quot; he said . &quot; Everybody will start receiving their insurance checks. &quot; Not far from the epicenter , Roy Armstrong also is standing at the threshold of an upturn . His Northridge business , Far West Plywood Co. , has recently suffered some of the worst weeks ever . But word on the street is encouraging . &quot; They ' re quoting the work , &quot; Armstrong said of the building contractors to whom he sells lumber and other materials . &quot; They ' re just waiting for the money . There ' s a lot of bidding going_on right now. &quot; No magic formula can reveal precisely how a region will fare in the aftermath of disaster . But Miami ' s experience with Hurricane Andrew may be instructive . The August , 1992 , storm devastated sections of Dade County and was blamed for $ 23 billion in losses . Yet $ 19 billion in relief , mostly private insurance money , seemed to propel Miami out of recession shortly after the storm , despite the closure of nearby Homestead Air_Force Base . The county gained 28 # 400 payroll jobs in 1993 , an above-average advance , and the unemployment_rate fell to 7.8 % from about 10 % . &quot; There ' s no doubt that it ( disaster relief ) speeds_up economic_growth in the short run , no doubt at all , &quot; said Pat Fishe , a professor of economics at the University of Miami . &quot; A lot of employment and a lot of income was created that people didn ' t plan to create. &quot; It will be a long_time before Californians know the final price_tag of the quake . UCLA researchers last week estimated earthquake losses at $ 13.5 billion , although the governor ' s office maintains that the damage is between $ 13 billion and $ 20 billion . Overall , government_agencies are providing $ 11.6 billion in aid and insurers are providing $ 3.5 billion . But Southern Californians stand to benefit more from relief money than their counterparts in other places because a lot of the cash will stick_around . Local factories can produce many of the items needed for replacement and rebuilding , from home_appliances to building_materials to electronic_equipment . &quot; After about March you ' ll start to see a plus from the rebuilding effort , &quot; said Ted Gibson , principal economist at the California Department of Finance . &quot; You ' ll get an economic push for a year to 18 months that otherwise would not have occurred. &quot; Ultimately , residents and retailers may feel the pinch of lost wages and out-of-pocket rebuilding expenses . Damage to the region ' s image , as employers and tourists choose to stay_in_places they perceive to be safer , will be hard to measure . Some analysts view the negatives as enough to cancel_out the positives . In the first_half of this year , Los Angeles housing values may be 1 percentage_point lower than without the quake , according to First Interstate Bancorp , with steeper declines expected in the San Fernando Valley . &quot; In the long_run , it ' s a negative , &quot; said the University of Miami ' s Fishe . &quot; Otherwise you ' d like these disasters to keep coming along. &quot; It is , however , a modest negative , almost too small to discern as the years progress , economists say . UCLA researchers were startled Friday when statewide jobs data for February revealed virtually no earthquake losses . &quot; If February didn ' t show the hit , we could be talking positive gains from here on out , &quot; said UCLA economist Larry J . Kimbell , discarding his initial estimate of a short-term loss of 29 # 000 jobs . &quot; We could be talking the end of recession. &quot; The local economy should create 36 # 000 new jobs by September , the UCLA study found , knocking 2 percentage_points off the unemployment_rate and triggering an economic recovery three months earlier than expected . After 1996 , as the rebuilding stimulus peters out , the county will lose another 12 # 600 jobs , according to the forecast . But that loss may be partly offset by other job gains because a recovery is expected to be in_progress . &quot; We agonized over the question -- is this earthquake a good thing for California ? &quot; Kimbell said . The long-term answer , he and colleague Nancy Bolton concluded , was no -- but almost to a minuscule degree in an economic sense . In the short term , the quake ' s aftermath has been a time of economic turmoil , reminiscent_of wartime for many scrambling enterprises . Bed Bath &amp; Beyond , a national retailer , air-freighted new inventory , such_as breakable picture_frames and glassware , to meet public demand after the quake . Moreover , it flew dozens of managers in from around the country to get its four Los Angeles-area stores back into shape . &quot; These guys flew in from Florida , from New York , from around the country . We probably had 100 guys , &quot; said regional manager Art Stark . &quot; They dropped what they were doing and were here for 15- ( to ) 18-hour days , seven days a week . It was an amazing thing. &quot; Construction firms , their suppliers and a wide range of specialists from asbestos removers to glass replacers are among the many beneficiaries of rebuilding . Yet the massive task of getting things back to normal is creating less obvious opportunities as well . Masters of Printing , a small business in Northridge , suffered $ 10 # 000 in damage , along with the loss of important customers at the Northridge Fashion Center . For the moment , however , the post-quake helter-skelter of people moving_around , scrambling for aid -- and keeping_in touch with each other -- has provided a jolt of printing work . &quot; We ' ve been doing a lot of business_cards . We ' ve been doing a lot of flyers , &quot; said Natalie Berger , who owns the shop with her husband . &quot; A lot of copies have to be made_for FEMA ( Federal Emergency Management Agency ) stuff . Fortunately , we have been busy. &quot; It will remain a mystery how the economy would have performed without the one-two punch of disaster and rebuilding . Some believe the earthquake struck at a pivotal moment when the region was starting to edge out of recession . Home sales had been rallying . Economists had detected an emerging trend of lower job losses , despite the continued weakness in aerospace and defense . Business failures in California had declined slightly after shooting_up in 1991 and 1992 . New businesses were being created , and opinion surveys pointed to rising public confidence . Now , the prospect of billions of dollars in relief money has become the most persuasive piece of evidence that Southern California ' s long economic winter is going_to end this year . &quot; We don ' t want to get lulled into saying , ' Hey , everything ' s great . It ' s just like the good old days , ' &quot; said USC ' s Schapiro . &quot; But we are_on the path to recovery -- undoubtedly. &quot; * RELATED STORY : D1</TEXT>
