   <TEXT> * So Saddam Hussein has reared his ugly head again ! Just as George_Bush demonized this comic_book villain four years ago , Bill_Clinton is now taking his turn -- just in time for the November election . The United States had no business getting_into the Iraq / Kuwait conflict in 1990 . I was part of the 10 % who opposed the Gulf War . I am proud that my wife and I spent every weekend at the Federal Building in Westwood protesting this unjust , unnecessary war . The U.S. succeeded in killing 100 # 000 Iraqis , unfortunate people who didn ' t choose Saddam as their leader and had no way to get_rid_of him . This was clearly wrong . Since the Gulf War , the supposed &quot; alternative &quot; -- as if the situation is the U.S. ' to fix -- has been economic sanctions . This policy hurts the people of Iraq . Our government can take responsibility for Iraqi children who face malnutrition , inadequate medical_care , and shortages because goods can ' t get_into the country . The embargo should end immediately . I urge President Clinton to drop the embargo against the Iraqi people and to withdraw all U.S. troops from the Middle_East . The U.S. is not the world ' s policeman . TED BROWN Pasadena * Flashback : George_Bush commits troops to Desert Storm ; assures American people that oil is not the issue but rather the restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait in the name of justice . Present : Bill_Clinton commits troops to the restoration of the legitimate government of Haiti ; is pilloried for jeopardizing American troops in the absence of a threat to national security_interests . Flash forward : Demands are made on the Clinton_Administration to commit troops to Kuwait to protect the oil reserves in the name of our national security_interests . ROBERT B . SILVER Los Angeles * Regarding your editorial , &quot; Clinton Said ' No , ' and Saddam Blinked , &quot; Oct . 11 : I think not . Clinton is still dealing with a military deck that Ronald Reagan provided , you know , in those greedy ' 80s , when he and his wife were trying to become millionaires in one-party Arkansas . The military was made strong again , first rate , in spite of the protests of the liberal Democrats in Congress . Don ' t you think it strange that the liberals who were so against the Gulf War , when George_Bush was President , are now strangely silent , as Clinton tries to increase his poll numbers . Haiti . A great foreign_policy victory ? No . Just danger for American kids . RICHARD L . SWIFT Covina * Tell me , why were the Republicans not screaming for a &quot; consent of Congress &quot; before Clinton sent 36 # 000 troops to oil-rich Kuwait , where the danger to the men and women of our military is far more real than it ever was in Haiti ? Can anyone doubt that the trillionaire Emir of Kuwait thinks_of Uncle_Sam as &quot; Uncle Sucker &quot; ? BILL LIVINGSTONE Santa Barbara * Ross Perot ' s paranoid warning that President Clinton ' s strong response to Iraq ' s troop buildup along the Kuwait border is nothing but a ploy to gain strength in the upcoming election ( Oct . 10 ) proves what many have suspected all along -- that Perot is not only inane , he is insane . I hate to think what would have happened to the world if Perot had been President in 1940 . JACK ALLEN Pacific Palisades * Was Saddam Hussein really &quot; naive &quot; to think that he could shake_off sanctions by dispatching his troops to the border ? The last six months have been witness to a parade of renegade leaders who , strangled by global sanctions , have touched_off international incidents to gain a bargaining_chip . And whether it was Kim Il Sung , Fidel Castro or Raoul Cedras , the U.S. has gladly gone_to the negotiating table with them . Perhaps Saddam was logically expecting Jimmy_Carter to ride to his rescue . BYRWEC ELLISON Lakewood * The second_coming of Saddam Hussein is the lesson that we seem unwilling to learn . Nearly all wars are caused by the ambitious self-love of one man . Saddam ' s single voice now summons us again to war as he luxuriates in fame . No longer can we hope that diplomacy , negotiations and compromise with another nation will substitute for individual redress . Instead , a world_court must charge this man with crimes against humanity ; arrest , convict and banish , not kill , but keep as living evidence of our determination to end war , the vice of the emperors . Orderly progress is man ' s destiny . It will come when we establish a process that anticipates and suppresses these individual scourges of our future . SID O ' NEIL Alamo , Calif .</TEXT>
