   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : ' 94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER ; ' HAIR-TRIGGER GRIN ' GETS PUT TO WORK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One guy named Moe . Tommy Moe , American , is sitting_by himself , elbow on a desk , chin cupped in his palm , daydreaming , drifting_off into space , scratching his Fu Manchu , four days before his downhill run . He is thinking_about Bill Johnson , about another place , another race , another American . He is thinking_about Wild Bill ' s wild ride down the slope of an Alp , about what it must have been like , 10 years before , descending that snowy stairway from heaven . &quot; Let ' s see . Yeah . Where was I then ? &quot; Tommy Moe asks himself . Away he goes , on a ski_lift in his mind , transporting himself backward in time , searching his memory . A smile suddenly gleams like a sunbeam on a snowcap . One often does . The official USA ski team guide describes Tommy Moe as having &quot; a hair-trigger grin. &quot; He says , &quot; Guess I must ' ve been in Alaska . I was , like , 13 or 14 years old , so , you know , I don ' t know how far I could have wandered off. &quot; Palmer , Alaska , population 2 # 666 and several moose , is the Moe family ' s home base . Has been for years . Pa Moe ( Tom Sr. ) runs a river-rafting business near Mt . Alyeska for what he calls &quot; day-trippers. &quot; Step-Mom Moe ( Tyra ) began her weekend in Palmer , north of Anchorage on the way to Fairbanks . She and her husband day-tripped by airplane and automobile Saturday and came huffing and puffing to the zenith of a Norwegian mountain_range Sunday morning , just in time to see Tommy ski . And oh , what they saw . They saw him hurtle downward at speeds as high as 80 m.p.h. , hugging every turn , bumping and grinding over snow and rock . They saw him descend the 2 # 746 feet of Kvitfjell in a low tuck , then glide to a stop within sight of the frosted Glomma riverbank . They saw him squint into a perfect sun , flip up his goggles , check_out his time and thrust his arms skyward triumphantly . Tommy Moe , king of the_hill . That hair-trigger face of his , clean-shaven now , fired off another grin . Look who was here . What a place for a family reunion . Great-Great-Great-Grandpa Moe made his home here in Norway in the 19th Century before emigrating to the New World . Great Uncle Olvar , 82 , still_lives in Oslo , as do a dozen other Nordic kin . What a place for this to happen . Even in his daydreams , he couldn ' t quite picture it . &quot; would n ' t it be unbelievable , me winning ? &quot; Tommy asks , four days before the race . Sure would be . &quot; Maybe I will , &quot; he says . Tommy Moe , American , on top of the world . He has had total northern exposure . He knows every inch of our 49th state . He mountain-bikes . He kayaks . He camps_out . He fishes . He and his older brother , Mike Moe , go free-skiing . Together they recently built a house , with the name , Downhill Circle , etched into the driveway post . Tommy can clown_around about having been an adolescent stranded in Alaska , but fact is , when he was 14 , he already was winning medals in junior events , mushing along like a malamute , making tracks . Mike never sensed how much faster his brother could go . Their father said here Sunday , &quot; Mike ' s back home , probably tearing the house down right now. &quot; On Feb . 17 , 1970 , slightly more_than 24 years to the day before he would become America ' s favorite and most famous Alaskan , Tommy Moe was born in Montana , up near the glorious peaks of Missoula . He grew_up and hung_out in the hillsides near Whitefish . When his ancestors left Europe and headed for lower ground , they didn ' t want to go too low . They settled in Montana , not long after it achieved statehood . This is where Tommy Moe started_out . Then he moved north to Alaska and that ' s when his gold_rush really began . At 4 , he already could ski . Once up in Alaska , though , Tommy Moe got familiar_with Mt . Alyeska the way children closer to sea_level got_to know hockey rinks or soccer fields . Tommy took sixth place in the U.S. junior championships a_couple_of days before another dear-diary birthday , his sweet 16th . Later that same year , he also won the Western J-II downhill , the super-G , the grand slalom . A silver in the slalom , too . Tommy Moe was junior skiing ' s hottest property . And then , in Tommy ' s teens , skiing in America became hotter than ever before . At Sarajevo in 1984 , after years and years of European rule , oh , how the Americans had flabbergasted everybody . As others crashed all_over the Mt . Bjelasnica slalom course -- only 47 of 101 starters completed two runs -- Phil Mahre paired his silver medal from Lake Placid with a gold . His twin brother , Steve , got the silver . And then both twins broke_down crying on American TV , when Donna de Varona broke the news to Phil that his wife had given_birth to a son . That wasn ' t a bad way to end an Olympics . But combined with what happened at the beginning of those Olympics , skiing ' s popularity in American rose like never before . Bill Johnson had won the downhill . &quot; Remember what he said before the race ? &quot; Tommy Moe asks , on this dreamy day in Norway 10 years later . Yes , someone says , but Tommy repeats it anyway . &quot; He said , ' Everybody else is racing for second place. ' &quot; Tommy Moe knows this story the way other kids know stories about Babe_Ruth supposedly pointing to a baseball fence , or Joe Namath guaranteeing a football game . He knows that Bill Johnson went_on to say , &quot; I don ' t even know why everyone else is here , &quot; not unlike the way another Johnson , a football_coach from Dallas , would crow 10 years later that his team would have no problem with a team from San Francisco . How even though no American had ever won an Olympic downhill gold medal , the totally cool Wild Bill stood_in front of everybody and said , &quot; They should just hand it to me now. &quot; One of Tommy Moe ' s all-time favorite tales . &quot; So why didn ' t you do that ? &quot; the person he is chatting with inquires , once a crowded room has cleared_out . Tommy Moe gives him the eye and says , &quot; You know , I thought_about it . I really did. &quot; Then that grin again . &quot; would n ' t that have been cool ? &quot; he asks . Sure would have .</TEXT>
