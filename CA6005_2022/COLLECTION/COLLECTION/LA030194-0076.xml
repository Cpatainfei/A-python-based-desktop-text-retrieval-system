   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEW ; L ' ORCHESTRE NATIONAL : FROM PARIS WITH FINESSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once upon a time , not that long ago , orchestras had faces . They didn ' t all sound more or less the same . * The differences had a lot to do with national proclivities of style and taste , not to mention uniformity of personnel , schools and techniques . Now , as the world shrinks , as people move and boundaries collapse , the language of music is becoming even more universal than we expected . A Beethoven symphony in Moscow needn ' t be all that different , these days , from a Beethoven symphony in Minneapolis or Munich or Milan . And , significantly , it may be conducted by the same maestro in all four places . Still , some things change less than others . At least , some things change less quickly . Take , for grateful example , the Orchestre National de France , which came_into existence 60 years ago as L ' Orchestre National de Radiodiffusion Francaise . We used to regard it as a typically French orchestra ; that is , an orchestra more notable for finesse than force . It never was a dazzling virtuoso instrument , and its special timbre -- transparent strings , nasal winds , lean brass -- wasn ' t always admired in the Germanic repertory . But , if one switched_on the radio or played drop-the-needle guessing_games , no one was likely to confuse this orchestra with the Chicago Symphony or the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam . When it first visited America in 1948 , the Orchestre de France played mostly French music . Now , returning for its ninth tour , the ensemble pays only token attention to its national origin in matters of repertory . The all-too-hackneyed agenda Sunday afternoon at the Orange County Performing Arts Center began with something legitimately , delicately Gallic : Ravel ' s &quot; Ma Mere l ' Oye &quot; suite , a.k.a. &quot; Mother Goose. &quot; Then the focus turned_to all-purpose sure-fire Russia , with Tchaikovsky ' s all-purpose sure-fire Violin Concerto followed by Mussorgsky ' s all-purpose sure-fire &quot; Pictures at an Exhibition &quot; ( the latter presumably assuming a second-hand French accent through Ravel ' s 1922 orchestration ) . But -- and it is a big but -- the Orchestre National de France played everything on this occasion like a recognizably French orchestra . Under Charles Dutoit , the Lausanne native who succeeded Lorin Maazel as music-director in 1991 , the old-fashioned virtues of elegance and understatement overpowered any ominous threat of banality . * The revelations came at the outset . Ravel ' s wispy storybook evocations were delineated with a really idiomatic touch -- that is , with a very_light touch . The strings shimmered sensuously . The narrative punctuation was applied with wit predicated on restraint . The charm was gentle , the scale always intimate . A similarly modest view of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto proved illuminating , if somewhat startling . Dutoit and his attentive followers refused to wallow in the inherent emotional goo , and the bona-fide Russian soloist , Vladimir Spivakov , approached the heroic bravura as if it were so_much chamber_music . We certainly have heard more rousing performances of the hum-along masterpiece , and we have heard more accurate ones . Some of the orchestral lines in mid-concerto got a bit tangled , and rhythmic definition turned_out to be a bit flabby . For all his energetic hopping and climactic bobbing , Spivakov found the lyrical passages more congenial than the dramatic outbursts . Still , it was rewarding to be reminded that Tchaikovsky can respond so nicely to a enlightened introspection . The French have always been good at deflating bombast . Under the prevailing aesthetic circumstances , the mighty &quot; Pictures at an Exhibition &quot; emerged more like miniatures . Dutoit ignored the vast canvas to which we have become accustomed , for better or worse , and he refused to exaggerate either grotesquerie or comic nuance . At the end , the &quot; Great Gate of Kiev &quot; resembled a relatively modest doorway . Still , everything was set_in its proper dynamic perspective , and the ultimate pealing cadences still managed to stimulate the usual push-button cheers . The cheers led to an encore that sustained the quasi-Russian ambience : the overture to Glinka ' s &quot; Ruslan and Ludmila. &quot; Incidental intelligence : * The agenda originally announced for this occasion was completely different and more demanding , too . It would have contrasted Roussel ' s &quot; Bacchus et Ariane &quot; with Stravinsky ' s &quot; Sacre du Printemps. &quot; Perhaps someone deemed it too forbidding for fragile Orange County sensibilities . * The house program , a veritable festival of typographical and editorial errors , claimed that Dutoit has &quot; been named principal guest-conductor of more_than 150 orchestras. &quot; He must be a very busy man . * The Orange County Philharmonic Society , which sponsors this stimulating series , has sent renewal notices for next season to its subscribers . The mailer lists the visiting artists and ensembles , but omits any mention of repertory . Perhaps someone assumed that local audiences only care about whom they hear , not what .</TEXT>
