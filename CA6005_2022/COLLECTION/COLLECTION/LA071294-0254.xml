   <HEADLINE> BAN ON STRIKER REPLACEMENTS HEADS FOR VOTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the most heated and emotional political battles between labor and management in a generation will climax today when the U.S. Senate casts a critical vote on legislation that would prohibit corporations from replacing striking union workers . Both corporate America and organized labor have poured their lobbying resources into the bitter congressional fight , one both sides see as critical to determining who will have the upper_hand in the American workplace of the 21st Century . Business groups fear that the striker-replacement bill would give unions unbridled power and sharply reduce management ' s authority over its workers . Union leaders , joined by the Clinton_Administration , believe that passage of the bill is vital to the survival of an American labor_movement badly shaken by the growing willingness of employers to resolve labor disputes by firing striking workers . &quot; This bill would make strikes risk-free and tip the balance_of_power at the bargaining table to the unions , &quot; warned Dan Yeager , a spokesman for the Labor Policy Assn. , a management lobbying group . William Klinefelter , chief lobbyist for the industrial-union department of the AFL-CIO , countered : &quot; This goes right to the heart of what the trade_union_movement is all about -- this issue is such an emotional one for our members because almost all_of them have been_on strike at one time or another in their lives. &quot; While the struggle intensifies , Rosemount , a Mississippi_River town south of Minneapolis , finds itself on the front_lines . Indeed , while business groups argue that companies only rarely use replacements for strikers , union officials warn that the story at the CF Industries , Inc. , fertilizer plant here is an example of an all-too-frequent scene today : one in which U.S. firms ranging from Caterpillar Inc. , to Greyhound Lines Inc. , are displaying an increasing willingness to replace striking workers and eliminate their unions -- or at least threaten to do so -- whenever contract negotiations bog_down . The rapid spread of such tactics during the last decade has had a &quot; chilling effect on unions and contract negotiations , &quot; said Bernard Brommer , president of the Minnesota AFL-CIO . &quot; Now most unions simply won ' t go_out on strike . They ' ll keep their workers in no matter what. &quot; In Rosemount , far from the arcane debate in Washington over legislative language , the issues are being played_out in real_life for workers like Doug Greene and supervisors like Gary Cater . Management and labor are locked_in an economic war with a rising toll in financial hardship and emotional stress on all sides . Twenty-four union workers are fighting to regain the jobs that they lost two months ago when management fired them and brought_in permanent non-union replacements immediately after their local union called a strike . Sixteen years after their last strike , the workers have found , to their horror , that it is no longer an effective weapon against management . Even before the walkout began , CF Industries made_it clear that it was ready to take a strike here in its only unionized facility . Weeks before the union decided to walk , the firm began advertising for replacement workers and building living quarters for out-of-state replacements in the plant ' s parking_lot . &quot; We had absolutely no choice , the union struck us at the height of our busy season , &quot; said Dan Van Tassel , spokesman for CF Industries at its headquarters in Long Grove , Ill . Now each day , picketing CF Industries workers like Ken McCloud -- under the watchful eyes of a phalanx of security_guards and cameras -- angrily scream at their replacements driving_in and out of the plant ' s gates and berate supervisors for refusing to reopen contract negotiations . &quot; Hey , scab ! Scab ! How does_it feel ? &quot; McCloud shouted one afternoon at a passing truck . The replacement worker in the driver ' s seat stared stonily ahead , refusing to return McCloud ' s glare from inches away . As the strike drags_on , the emotions on both sides are reaching a jagged edge , leading to increasingly dramatic confrontations . &quot; Why are you doing this to us ? &quot; Greene shouted in one exchange with Cater . &quot; All we want to do is work . Let us do our jobs. &quot; Cater , clearly tense , stopped his truck outside the plant gate to shout back at McCloud for insulting his wife . &quot; I ' ll meet you any day if you talk_about my wife ! &quot; he screamed . &quot; Leave my family out of this ! &quot; &quot; Why should we ? You haven ' t left our families out ! There are 24 families out here , not 24 guys ! &quot; was Greene ' s retort . His wife , Gail , and their two young sons watched the confrontation from the roadside . &quot; As time passes , the guys are getting more and more frustrated ; they don ' t know what ' s going_to happen , &quot; said Gail Greene , who now supports the family with her job as a nurse . Life on the picket_line is particularly hard for Greene and the other union_members because their lost jobs at CF Industries were so good -- and offered a ticket into the middle_class . Workers here had been union_members since the Rosemount plant opened in 1962 and they had enjoyed high wages -- as much as $ 36 # 000 a year with overtime -- for relatively unskilled work . &quot; It just blows my mind that we are out here , &quot; said Scott Dohman , a striking equipment operator . &quot; I was proud to tell people I worked_at CF Industries. &quot; Rick Stoffel , a CF Industries crane operator for 11 years , added : &quot; This is the best job I ' ve ever had . I would have been here 30 years. &quot; But trouble hit last winter when the Oil , Chemical and Atomic Workers Union , which represents the CF Industries workers , rejected a company demand for a new contract allowing the firm to hire non-union employees to work alongside union_members . &quot; We were willing to compromise . . . . We don ' t understand why they went_on strike over that , &quot; Van Tassel said . But now , with their only steady income coming from $ 305 a week in unemployment benefits and $ 50 in strike_pay , the CF Industries workers are beginning to feel the pinch . &quot; I ' m probably going_to lose my house , &quot; Stoffel sighed . Increasingly , Stoffel and other workers here look_to Washington and passage of the striker-replacement legislation for their salvation . While the legislation would not prevent firms like CF Industries from replacing workers temporarily during strikes , it would require management to hire them back after a settlement was reached . &quot; If we had that bill , we would be back at_work right now , &quot; said Paul Linder , a CF Industries striker and father of four . But in Washington , the debate over the striker-replacement bill has worn_down into an ideological war of words and competing studies , as both management groups and labor fight to win_over a handful of key swing votes that will be needed today to break an expected Republican filibuster in the Senate . &quot; Organized labor is trying to achieve politically ( with this legislation ) what it can ' t in the marketplace , which is to gain more members and more clout , &quot; said Jeff Joseph , a top lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce . Yet union lobbyists point to a new survey by the Bureau of National Affairs , a Washington research organization , showing that 82 % of companies surveyed said they would either use replacement workers or threaten their use in upcoming contract talks with their unions if Congress does not pass the striker replacement ban . In today ' s showdown in the Senate -- the striker-replacement ban already has passed the House -- union lobbyists concede that they can count_on just 56 or 57 votes , short of the 60 votes needed in a critical vote to break a filibuster and allow a full vote on the legislation . If the bill does go_down , the workers at CF Industries recognize it will have a direct impact on their futures . &quot; What is going_to happen to the middle_class if companies can just do this all_the time ? &quot; Greene asked . &quot; We will have two classes in this country , the high and the low . . . . All the companies will bust their unions. &quot;</TEXT>
