   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A WITH TIM SCHIFFER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tim Schiffer , the Ventura County Museum of History and Art ' s new curator , is a bright , soft-spoken sort , with a broad-based curiosity and a penchant for change and challenge -- within reason . A taste for moderate change is a characteristic job requirement in a museum such_as Ventura ' s -- aiming to please as large and wide a crowd as possible . The 39-year-old Yale graduate spent eight years teaching at the College of Creative Studies , an academic enclave at UCSB . At CCS , Schiffer gained valuable experience running the gallery space , known for its chance-taking exhibitions outside of commercial or general public considerations . It ' s another story entirely at the Ventura museum , where accountability is paramount , an active board and membership check every move , and aesthetic conservatism is the rule . Because his arrival in the curator ' s chair last October almost coincided with the museum ' s plum National Endowment for the Humanities grant , Schiffer is seen by many as a timely force for positive evolution at a key time in the museum ' s history . &quot; I think some people expect me to work some sort of wonder and do a make-over with this museum , and it ' s not in my job description , &quot; he said , laughing . &quot; I ' m just trying to do my job. &quot; But the very nature of that job may be in transition , as the museum goes_through a growth spurt and continues to refine its identity -- one that wavers on a line between history and art . Schiffer recently spoke about riding that fine line . The next day , he was off to Washington , D.C. , to learn a thing or two from the NEH . How does this new role differ from the job you had at UCSB ? This is much more complex , because there are more people involved . This museum has a lot of different facets to it . It ' s a historical society with a library and there is a mixture of art shows and historical shows . That makes_it a bit different . There is also the whole organization of the museum -- the board , the docents . It ' s a much larger institution . It involves working with a lot more people . Does the issue and importance of diplomacy come_up more often ? Yes , to a certain extent . I ' m trying to coordinate the different activities -- the tours , the membership drive , long-range planning for the museum that we need to be aware of . The NEH grant that we just got is , for me , very exciting . My part of it involves coordinating the efforts of a number of different people to try and get this plan for the new exhibit done . There is a lot of responsibility attached_to it . It seems like this grant might usher_in the next phase of the museum ' s life . Is that true ? I think so . I think this museum is_on a definite upward tack . I hope that it will allow us to have a really good installation in the gallery . This museum gets a lot of use by school kids and tour groups , so it should be really good . It ' s one of the only things of its kind that ' s available in Ventura . The art aspect of the museum came_into being much later than the historical component . Does that color the attitude toward exhibitions ? There is , not animosity , but some people in the membership favor the historical aspect , and some favor the art aspect . When they changed it to the Ventura County Museum of History and Art , some people thought that was a good change , and some didn ' t . I think people are OK with it . I gave a lecture about art a_few weeks ago and 40 of the docents showed_up . That was a good showing . A lot of the shows that we do are crossover between history and art , like the ( late Santa Paula artist ) Cornelius Bottke show coming_up . We ' re going to do a show of all his etchings . He ' s part of the history of Ventura County . On the other hand , I ' m going_to do a tool show this summer -- featuring historical tools and appliances . I think that will go_in the opposite way : It ' s a historical show that will have an art side to it , because a lot of those tools are almost art . Old tools get_into the art realm . My idea is that you try to have a variety of shows so that people will be encouraged to come_in and broaden their interests a little bit . Do you feel that you have to do that with kid_gloves on , not stepping too far outside of certain parameters of taste ? I would say that I don ' t see it being a museum for cutting-edge contemporary art . I just don ' t think that ' s what the museum is about . The mission of the museum , as it ' s written , is about Ventura County art-wise and history-wise . Part of what the art shows should do would be to encourage artists in Ventura County and give them some kind of venue to show their work , and also to show historical work that relates somehow to the county or is by county residents . Next year , I ' m hoping to do a show of Otto and Vivika Heino , the ceramic artists from Ojai . They ' ve been here since the ' 50s . Do you have_in_mind to change the identity of the museum ? Partly because there ' s an endowment in the museum now for art exhibits , I think that will change the identity of the museum in terms of what kinds of things it ' s able to present . There is funding for doing_good art shows and catalogues , occasionally . There ' s a fine_arts committee that provides support for doing the art shows . They organize the Assembly of the Arts show on_their_own . It ' s a really positive group . They ' re interested in forming a collection of art as opposed to just historical things . We own a_few nice paintings and a_few prints and things , but they ' re interested in trying to keep artwork in the county and eventually -- if the museum expands -- having a permanent exhibition space for artwork . We ' ve drawn_up an art accession policy . And you play a critical role in that whole process of accenting the art of the museum ' s title ? Well , my background is in art , but right now I ' m finishing the Portuguese show , which will be the next show . I ' ve put a lot of energy into that . It ' s about Portuguese immigration to Ventura County and the Portuguese community . It ' s funny : It ' s taken a lot more time than a comparable art show would take , because I have to find all_the material . Josef Woodard</TEXT>
