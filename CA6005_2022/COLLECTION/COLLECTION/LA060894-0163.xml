   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE ; LET GOPHER DIG FOR GOVERNMENT INFORMATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Time was when getting information from the U.S._government involved letter writing , phone_calls and sometimes even trips to Washington to search through records . Nowadays , you can get a good bit of government information on the Internet . One of the best tactics is to use gopher , a simple menuing system that will take you almost anywhere on the Net.Investors will be glad to learn that corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission , previously available on the Internet only by invoking various arcane commands , are now easy to get this way . Type gopher town.hall.org to get a menu of items , including the keyword-searchable SEC database ( known as Edgar ) , as well as a new section containing U.S. patents and trademarks . For more general information , type gopher marvel.loc.gov. If you don ' t have gopher , type telnet marvel.loc.gov and use marvel as the log-in . The marvel gopher can help you access government data on topics ranging from aerospace to weather , including U.S. Census_Bureau data , job openings and federal assistance programs . Marvel and other gophers also offer the Library of Congress catalogue . Another good resource is the Commerce_Department ' s Economic Bulletin_Board , which can be reached by typing telnet ebb.stat-usa.gov and logging_in as guest . If you lack Internet access , just use your modem to dial ( 202 ) 482-2584 . You can browse through hundreds of economic indicators , some of them updated daily . ADAM S . BAUMAN</TEXT>
