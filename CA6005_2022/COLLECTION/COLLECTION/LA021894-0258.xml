   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : AIRPORT AUTHORITY URGES EL TORO STUDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An association of cities that wants the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station converted into a commercial airport called_on the county Thursday to commission an independent study of the issue . Members of the Orange County Regional Airport Authority said that an &quot; unbiased and untainted &quot; review is a logical way of determining how best to use the 4 # 700-acre base when it is closed at the end of the decade . The airport authority officials suggested that the county use the Washington-based Urban Land Institute to conduct the study . Institute officials who attended Thursday ' s Orange County Regional Airport Authority meeting said that such a study would be carried_out by a panel of economists , land-use planners , aviation industry officials and other experts . All panelists would come from outside California , reducing the likelihood that conclusions would be drawn based on local political considerations , airport authority officials said . &quot; This is an opportunity for us to get some good advice on the El Toro conversion , &quot; said Mark Leyes , a Garden Grove councilman and airport authority member . &quot; This would be an unbiased review . ( The panel ) would have no vested interests. &quot; An Urban Land Institute study would cost about $ 100 # 000 . Leyes suggested that the county and the airport authority might share the costs . What to do with El Toro has been a hot topic ever since the Pentagon announced last year its intentions to close the base . Some South County cities oppose converting the base into an airport , fearing that such a move would cause traffic , noise and pollution problems . But other cities , including Garden Grove , Anaheim and Newport Beach , argue that building an air-cargo facility at El Toro would be a boost to the county ' s economy . The county has formed a nine-member board to oversee the conversion of El Toro . The panel is made_up of five county supervisors as well as council_members from Irvine and Lake Forest .
