   <HEADLINE> LAWMAKERS BACK FCC ' S PLAN TO FAVOR 3 FIRMS IN AUCTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Moving to choke_off 11th-hour objections to a license auction plan that would help pay_for global trade legislation , lawmakers met Wednesday to blast Pacific Bell and other critics for calling the proposal a &quot; billion-dollar giveaway &quot; in the telecommunications arena . The bickering stems from a little-known provision in the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that would give three media companies that developed a new mobile telephone technology a substantial discount on government licenses needed to offer the service . A year ago , the Federal Communications Commission agreed to give the three &quot; pioneer &quot; firms free licenses to serve markets in Los Angeles , New York and Washington , but it backed_down after several members of Congress objected . The FCC then proposed to give them discounts of about 10 % , but the GATT provisions would sweeten that to as much as 50 % . Other entrepreneurs , meanwhile , are expected to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the mobile licenses when they are auctioned to the highest bidder by the FCC later this year . At least $ 400 million of the auction proceeds are earmarked to pay_for implementation of the GATT treaty . But critics , including Pacific Bell and Texas businessman Ross Perot , have launched a blistering attack on the discounts won by the three companies : American Personal Communications , which is 70 % -owned by Washington Post Co. ; Cox Enterprises Inc. , and Omnipoint Corp . In full-page newspaper_ads this week , for example , Pacific Bell termed the discounts a &quot; billion-dollar giveaway. &quot; But the barrage of criticism apparently swayed few lawmakers . Edward J . Markey , the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance , said critics are simply &quot; using this one provision as a means to derail the larger ( GATT ) legislation. &quot;</TEXT>
