   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : HE KNOWS AGONY OF THE FEET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dallas kicker Eddie Murray , whose own Super Bowl moment could be coming this Sunday , cuts_to the quick when asked about the memory of Scott Norwood and wide right on that fateful evening three years ago in Tampa Stadium . &quot; I don ' t want to use this as an analogy , &quot; Murray says , &quot; but every kicker felt all_the emotions he was going_through as much as every guy felt the emotions Bobbitt went_through . &quot; It didn ' t happen to us , but we had an idea of what might have been going_through his head at that time. &quot; There is one significant difference , however . John Wayne Bobbitt once was lost , then he was found . Norwood never made_it back , never all_the way , and now he is gone , a cautionary tale for every poor soul who ever had to split the uprights for his daily bread . &quot; When that ball went sailing to the right , I felt it , too , &quot; Murray says . &quot; I have kicked it to the right when it meant something . But never when it meant a Super Bowl . &quot; Unfortunately , that made_it more magnified. &quot; For better or worse , Murray could be stepping under that magnifying glass next . If Murray ' s lucky , this Dallas-Buffalo Super Bowl will proceed along the same lines as the last one , when his predecessor , Lin Elliott , wore himself out kicking_off and tacking_on extra points . If not , Murray insists he will be prepared . &quot; I ' ve been thinking_about it for 14 years , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' m the kicking version of Chris Farley . You know those basketball commercials ? I ' ve been going_over all these scenarios in practice for years and years and years . &quot; This is my opportunity . Maybe , I might get a shot at it. &quot; Thirteen of those years were spent in Detroit , Kansas City and Tampa Bay , where daydreaming is usually the extent of the Super Bowl experience . For Murray to finally get his ticket punched , another comrade had to fall wide of the goal post with another monumental game on the line . That would have been Dallas ' second game of the 1993 regular season -- early September for the rest of the world , but in Dallas , nervous time . When Elliott missed two field_goals in a 13-10 loss to Buffalo , the Cowboys dropped to 0-2 and Texas was in a state of hysteria . &quot; Off with his head ! &quot; all_of Dallas cried . Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson , in a benevolent mood , settled for Elliott ' s job . Soon , Murray ' s phone was ringing and a tryout was arranged . Murray was unemployed at the time , having been cut at the end of Tampa Bay ' s training camp . He was instructed to fly down for the day and engage in an eight-man kickoff . To the winner would go a paycheck -- and maybe another if he didn ' t shank one against Phoenix . Johnson goes_through kickers like cans of hair varnish . In four-plus seasons , Roger Ruzek , Luis Zendejas , Ken Willis and Elliott had come and left . By the time Murray ' s plane touched_down in Dallas , he had a firm idea of what he was stepping into . &quot; I ' ve seen every press_conference ( Johnson ) has had just after one of his kickers has done poorly , &quot; Murray says . &quot; I remember watching ESPN after the Buffalo game and hearing him make comments that he was going_to bring kickers in to replace Lin Elliott . &quot; I remember his comments after Ken Willis left the Cowboys on Plan B to go_to Tampa Bay after he said he would n ' t leave . You can make_up any adjective you want , because Jimmy used all_of them . &quot; So Jimmy ' s relationship with kickers is something I was conscious of. &quot; Was Murray bothered ? &quot; Not at all , &quot; he says , &quot; because he never had me as a kicker . That may sound like an arrogant statement , but that ' s how I looked_at it . He never knew what it was like to work with me. &quot; If there ' s one thing Johnson can appreciate , it ' s arrogance . The man breathes it instead of oxygen . If there ' s another thing he can appreciate , it ' s hitting 10 of 10 field-goal attempts into rain and 25-m.p.h wind . Murray walked the walk and kicked the kick . Doubly impressed , Johnson told Murray to get a physical and show_up at practice the next day . Murray and Johnson have hardly spoken since . This means Murray is doing splendid work . In 14 regular-season games with Dallas , Murray converted 85 % of his field_goal tries , 100 % of his extra points and finished third in the conference with 122 points . He averaged 8.7 points per game with the Cowboys , roughly the same as the Ram offense under T.J. Rubley . He set a club record with 28 field_goals and received a game ball after kicking Dallas into the playoffs with three field_goals in a 16-13 victory over the New York Giants . So what ' s this business about Emmitt Smith as league MVP ? Weren ' t the Cowboys also 0-2 without Murray ? &quot; Some of my family members might think that , &quot; Murray says with a grin . And don ' t try convincing Murray the game is worse off today because men of his ilk -- short of stature and strong of quadriceps -- have turned the NFL into a weekly procession of 9-6 sleeping pills . &quot; I think , &quot; Murray says , &quot; it ' s just a situation where kickers have adapted to rule changes a lot quicker than the other players . . . &quot; What really changed it was when the college ranks took the kicking blocks ( tees ) away . It made college field-goal kickers more proficient by the time they came_into the NFL . &quot; I don ' t know if that ' s good or bad . You ' re splitting hairs , really . The owners and the competition committee say they want to make a change . But talk to me and I ' ll tell you that I ' m proud_of those kickers who come_in and do what they ' re asked to do -- and that ' s kick field_goals . &quot; I mean , it is called foot ball. &quot; Or talk to the Buffalo Bills . What the game needs now , they will tell you , is more field_goals , not less . One more , properly placed three years ago , would have done just fine .</TEXT>
