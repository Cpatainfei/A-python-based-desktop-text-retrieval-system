   <HEADLINE> SOME KIND OF WONDER STUFF ; EXISTENTIAL CRISIS PASSED , MILES HUNT AND BAND-MATES ARE BACK ON THE ROAD , FOR ' CONSTRUCTION FOR THE MODERN IDIOT. ' THEY ' LL BE AT THE COACH_HOUSE SUNDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Miles Hunt of the Wonder Stuff concluded a_few years ago that being a rock_star , or at least something approximating one , wasn ' t so wonderful after all . To hear the_English band ' s singer tell it , 1991 was a year of fear and loathing on the campaign trail as he and the Wonder Stuff tried to promote their then-current album , &quot; Never Loved Elvis. &quot; One of the low points came July 29 , on Hunt ' s 25th birthday , when a friend invited him to celebrate by attending a Guns N ' Roses concert at the Forum in Inglewood . Hunt had spent the previous three weeks crisscrossing the United States on a publicity tour without the band , chatting_up the &quot; Elvis &quot; album in a round of interviews and other promotional appearances . As he watched Axl Rose strut , Hunt found himself questioning the terms of_his_own existence . &quot; Guns N ' Roses came_on in all their stupidity . I was extremely intoxicated , and I was looking_at them and the audience , and I hated everyone in the room , &quot; Hunt recalled over the phone last week from Seattle , the first stop on a tour that brings the Wonder Stuff to the Coach_House on Sunday . Hunt remembers wondering exactly what it was he was striving for : &quot; I spent three weeks whoring around America to pacify my record company , and this ( GNR-style arena-rock godhead ) is the end result ? I got very upset and decided I would stop being in the group and get a job . I ' m not saying I ' m a victim ( of rock ' s promotional machinery ) . I know it ' s my choice . But it came_to a massive confusion for me. &quot; At least Hunt got a song out of his moment of revulsion . On a plane flight the next day , the badly hung-over singer began scrawling diary notes that subsequently emerged in &quot; Hush , &quot; a song from the Wonder Stuff ' s new release , &quot; Construction for the Modern Idiot. &quot; The song , which begins with the line , &quot; If this is the prize , it feels_like a threat , &quot; expresses Hunt ' s misgivings about the chase for fame and his reluctance to divulge too_much of his inner self to the public . The song ' s last line goes , &quot; No , you don ' t know my relatives , and that ' s as deep as you get in. &quot; Instead of getting a job , Hunt soldiered on with the Wonder Stuff , which nearly staged its own Waterloo in a Tokyo hotel_room . &quot; I was very serious &quot; about quitting , Hunt said . &quot; Things came_to a worse head by the end of the year , when the whole band came_to blows with one another . I attacked everybody . The first thing I threw was the lamp , &quot; which meant that the Wonder Stuff ' s internecine free-for-all took_place in the dark . &quot; There was no light in the room , I was hurling things at everybody , &quot; he said . &quot; The next few gigs were difficult . We were all on stage wondering who had hit who. &quot; As the long , glorious and occasionally pugilistic careers of the Who and the Kinks attest , a bit of brawling among band-mates seems to do British rockers some good . The Wonder Stuff got_over its blow_up , and reconvened determined to take the idea of a &quot; fresh_start &quot; as literally as possible . As the band prepared to record again , Hunt said : &quot; We wrote and rehearsed all_the songs as if we were a brand-new band getting_together its first set . The old cliche about a band ' s first album being the easiest and most enjoyable to make -- there is a little bit of truth in that. &quot; The band rehired Paul Collier , the producer who had recorded its first two albums , &quot; The Eight Legged Groove Machine &quot; ( 1988 ) and &quot; Hup &quot; ( 1989 ) . Those had established the Wonder Stuff as a cheeky but exuberant and catchy band that managed to sound bilious and frolicsome at_the_same_time . The folk strains that dominated &quot; Never Loved Elvis , &quot; the band ' s more reflective third album , were de-emphasized in favor of a louder guitar-rock approach . Hunt reports that this was not a problem for Martin Bell , the fiddler / mandolinist / accordionist whose playing was highlighted on &quot; Elvis. &quot; Looking_for a new challenge , the singer says , Bell busied himself arranging the rich horn and string orchestrations that crop_up on several of the songs on &quot; Construction for the Modern Idiot. &quot; Hunt also rearranged some of his personal habits , first giving_up marijuana and then , about a year ago , booze . Although it is his policy not to write confessional songs , the new album alludes several times to his own bouts of excess . At a time when singing the praises of weed has become high_fashion in pop , as practiced by megaselling rappers ( Cypress Hill , Dr. Dre ) and rockers ( the Black Crowes ) , the Wonder Stuff takes a contrarian stance . One new song , &quot; Storm Drain , &quot; depicts pot as a sense-dulling , life-stalling escape . Going_against the flow is no problem for Hunt , a brash fellow who seems to relish a good verbal tussle and pulls no punches . &quot; Dope smokers bore the ( expletive ) out of me , &quot; he said . &quot; I know what a boring ( expletive , expletive ) I was when I used to smoke it . The song is a celebration of clearing my mind. &quot; Hunt says he gave_up marijuana several years ago at the behest of his wife but maintained his liberal intake of alcohol . &quot; I spent the majority of the last three or four years &quot; inebriated , he said , until &quot; I gave myself a little test &quot; last year and gave_up drinking . &quot; Now I get_up earlier , I do much more , I ' m a lot more sociable , and I think things through more clearly. &quot; Hunt says that some of his band-mates wondered whether he had thought things through clearly enough in his lyrics to &quot; I Wish Them All Dead. &quot; The track from &quot; Construction &quot; excoriates the Man-Boy Love Association , a fringe San Francisco group that cites the ancient_Greeks in advocating mentor-lover unions between men and boys . There is nothing controversial about condemning child_abuse , but Hunt takes his condemnation to extremes with lyrics that urge vigilante justice against abusers : &quot; It ' s time to pick_up a knife , or any weapon you like , to see an end to their lives , &quot; he spits . Hunt , who had just alighted in the United States , was momentarily taken_aback when told of recent California cases in which his wish came true : the Menendez case , in which , if one believes the defense , past sexual abuse justified a double parricide , and the Ellie Nesler case , in which a woman stepped_up in a Sonora courtroom and left her son ' s alleged molester riddled with bullets . &quot; She killed him in the courtroom ? ( Expletive ) me ! &quot; Hunt said in astonishment . His first impulse was to weasel . He began to suggest that &quot; I Wish Them All Dead , &quot; which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera expose on the MBLA , didn ' t actually advocate lynching child abusers . Then he caught himself . &quot; It doesn ' t . . . . Well , it does , actually , &quot; he admitted with a laugh . The song simply captures his &quot; knee-jerk reaction &quot; to its loathsome subject , Hunt said . &quot; Certain members of the band were saying , ' It ' s dodgy territory . Do you have to name who you ' re after ? ' They wanted to make_it more general. &quot; The song remained quite specific , and Hunt takes no responsibility for any listener who might act_on its very specific suggestions . &quot; People do whatever they do , &quot; he said . &quot; You ' re pretty much responsible_for your own actions. &quot; The Menendez and Nesler shootings both predated the September release of the &quot; Construction &quot; album . Although the Wonder Stuff has yet to move beyond cult status in America , it has had a healthy run in its homeland : Hunt said that &quot; Construction for the Modern Idiot , &quot; the band ' s fourth album , went Top 5 in England and has produced two hit singles , &quot; On the Ropes &quot; and &quot; Full of Life ( Happy Now ) . &quot; Touring opportunities abound : After its American tour , the Wonder Stuff will stay_on the road until June with tours of England , Australia and Japan . &quot; Then we might do another tour of North_America , if there appears to be a hungry audience that wants to see us again. &quot; All in all , Hunt said , life these days among the Wonder Stuff is fairly wonderful . The band that almost self-destructed is still on_the_road , singing , in &quot; On the Ropes , &quot; a battle_cry for intelligent rock : &quot; Do you want to know what this fight ' s about ? / Commerciality over art can ' t win out. &quot; After that near-Waterloo in ' 91 , the battle is going well again . &quot; We ' re in a very lucky position , basically , &quot; Hunt said . &quot; We ' re getting_away with it is the way we look_at it. &quot; * The Wonder Stuff , Chapterhouse and Primitive Painters play Sunday at 8 p.m. at the Coach_House , 33157 Camino Capistrano , San Juan Capistrano . $ 13.50.
