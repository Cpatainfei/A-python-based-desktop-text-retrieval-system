   <HEADLINE> OIL PRODUCERS FORGE PACT TO BUILD PIPELINE ; ENVIRONMENT : THE PROJECT , WHICH WOULD RUN 130 MILES BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD AND THE SOUTH BAY , IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND STILL FACES NUMEROUS HURDLES . BUT TANKER TRANSPORT MUST END OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a bid to settle a lengthy battle over how to transport crude_oil from the Point Arguello offshore field near Santa Barbara , the field ' s major oil producers have signed a memorandum of understanding to build a $ 150-million , 130-mile pipeline . The pipeline project would carry oil from Bakersfield to refineries in the Los Angeles Basin -- including Chevron ' s refinery in El Segundo and Texaco ' s refinery in Wilmington -- along a route past Santa Clarita and through the San Fernando Valley and central Los Angeles . Point Arguello crude would reach the new_line via the existing All American Pipeline . The project -- a joint_venture of Chevron U.S.A. Products Co. , Texaco Trading &amp; Transportation Inc. , Anschutz Co . and Pacific Pipeline System Inc. -- replaces an earlier proposed pipeline route along the coastline south of Santa Barbara . That route was opposed by the Los Angeles City_Council , questioned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and eventually abandoned by Chevron as too costly . &quot; We believe that this is a win-win-win for the county of Los Angeles , &quot; said Norman L . Rooney , Pacific Pipeline president . The pipeline could provide the long-term alternative to oil_tanker traffic along the coastline from Santa Barbara . The California Coastal Commission has required that tankering be eliminated over the next two years . Also , Rooney said , it could lessen environmental and safety risks , since it would be constructed using up-to-date technology that would reduce its vulnerability to earthquakes . It also would take some of the load off older pipelines -- one of which dramatically ruptured in the Northridge quake -- and trains now being used to bring crude_oil into Los Angeles . But environmentalists and other critics see numerous hurdles before the pipeline can go_forward . &quot; They have agreed on the route , but the people on the route haven ' t agreed with them , &quot; said Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez . Hernandez described the route choice as &quot; a classic example of environmental racism . . . . They ' ve chosen a route through densely populated minority and high-use areas. &quot; Hernandez prefers what is known as the Cajon pipeline route through the El Cajon Pass . In the past three years , he said , the council has voted for three motions opposing a permit for the section of the Pacific Pipeline route through heavily populated portions of the San Fernando Valley and central Los Angeles that remains from the earlier proposal . Environmentalists , who have opposed shipment of crude by tanker until a new pipeline can built , were equally skeptical of the new route ' s chances . &quot; We still feel that this may be the most difficult pipeline to get_through the ( permitting ) process , &quot; said Lisa Weil , policy director the American Oceans Campaign . Chevron and the other producers , she predicted , &quot; will use this to continue to find loopholes to allow their tankering from Point Arguello to continue past the deadlines imposed by the Coastal Commission last year. &quot; The commission approved the interim use of tankers by Chevron , contingent upon the oil_companies and pipeline builders meeting several milestones . The producers must also end all tanker use by Jan . 1 , 1996 , regardless of whether a pipeline is completed . Chevron is currently barred from using tankers because it failed to meet a Feb . 1 deadline that required a commitment to a specific pipeline project . It was also supposed to have the key permits required by various municipal_governments and agencies with jurisdiction over the pipeline route . And to get these , it has to have an approved environmental impact statement for the entire route . &quot; They ' re not on schedule , &quot; said Alison Dettmer , coastal program analyst with the Coastal Commission . &quot; I don ' t even think they can get the local approvals until fall of 1994 , based on their current schedule. &quot; Some environmentalists and regulators had expected Chevron to ask the Coastal Commission to amend its tanker permit and resume tanker operations because of the decision to back the Pacific Pipeline . But a Chevron spokesman said Thursday that no such request was contemplated . Proponents of the Pacific Pipeline hope to begin construction in early 1995 and to open the line by the time tanker use must end . The memo of understanding &quot; gives us the funds to make the project work while we negotiate funding for the overall project , &quot; said Rooney , the Pacific Pipeline president . One financing agreement has already been signed , he said . Larry Perkins , project coordinator for Chevron U.S.A. Inc. , said Chevron committed itself to the new route largely because it is shorter and less expensive than the first proposal , which would have cost $ 215 million , compared with the new route ' s $ 150-million price_tag . Also , it will let the company transport crude_oil from Kern County oil fields , which have faced a bottleneck coming_into the Los Angeles Basin . New Route for Offshore Oil In the continuing battle over shipping crude from the Point Arguello offshore oil fields to refineries in Los Angeles , an oil_industry consortium has proposed a 130-mile pipeline from Bakersfield through Santa Clarita to El Segundo and Wilmington . The line would connect with the existing All American Pipeline , Council opposes the urban segment of the latest route ; the proposal Cajon Pipeline is one alternative .</TEXT>
