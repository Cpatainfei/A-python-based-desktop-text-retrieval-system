   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / ELLIOTT ALMOND ; BETTER JUDGMENT NEEDED FROM THE ADULTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The sad , sordid affair of Jennifer Capriati , former tennis prodigy , should not come as a surprise . Not when future tennis stars are treated like deities before they reach puberty . Developing solid_ground strokes and good hand-eye coordination is fine , but the Nick Bollettieris and Stefano and Denise Capriatis of the tennis world might consider character development for the next one to come_along . And that takes time , like the aging of a fine wine . In 1990 , Capriati was rushed onto the professional circuit at 13 , and because we embrace new faces , she was an instant media and fan hit . She did not let us down , becoming the youngest player to win a match at Wimbledon , and the youngest Grand_Slam semifinalist in the_French Open . She also reached the Wimbledon semifinals in 1991 and won an Olympic gold medal by defeating Steffi Graf in 1992 at Barcelona . Since then , she has made more headlines away from the courts . She played her last match in August , and before this week was in another time_zone from her public life . Many chuckled when she was arrested last December for shoplifting a $ 10 ring . She claimed she forgot she was wearing it when she walked_out_of the Florida store . It was an acceptable excuse from a millionaire child . But last week ' s arrest for possession of fewer than 20 grams of marijuana , and her subsequent admission into a Miami Beach drug treatment facility have more ominous overtones . Capriati , 18 , who is believed to be estranged from her parents , reportedly spent a wild weekend in Coral Gables , Fla. , with new-found friends . One , Mark Black , told reporters he did not know she was a tennis star after an all-night party . &quot; I thought she was this girl Jennifer having a great time , &quot; he said , adding that Capriati later told him she simply wanted to be normal . If that means experiencing growing pains , the Capriatis are getting all_the normal they could want . &quot; What I think we ' re seeing here is a teen-ager who is going_to learn , who is learning , how to exercise good judgment , &quot; said John Ross , Capriati ' s attorney . But what the world also has witnessed is poor judgment by adults who surround her . that ' s not to say Capriati is not responsible_for her foibles , but with agents , attorneys , coaches and parents thinking more of dollar_signs than maturation , it is a wonder she lasted four years as a successful pro . She will be missed in the_French Open , opening Monday at Roland Garros Stadium with a vacuum in the women ' s field . But it ' s better to leave her be . She was right to put tennis on the sideline when she walked away last summer . She needs time to grow_up . * Top-seeded Pete Sampras and Steffi Graf , winners of seven of the past eight Grand_Slams , drew easy first-round opponents for the_French Open . Sampras will play a qualifier to be determined today , and Graf will face No . 106-ranked Katarina Studenikova of Slovakia . Andre Agassi , twice a finalist here , drew three-time winner Mats Wilander as his first opponent . Wilander needed a wild-card invitation to make the field , and Agassi , ranked 19th , failed to earn a place among the 16 seeded players . Defending champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain drew Martin Damm of the Czech Republic ; two-time winner Jim Courier drew France ' s Jean-Philippe Fleurian , and No . 2-seeded Michael Stich of Germany drew Renzo Furlan of Italy . * Venus rising : Venus Williams , widely hyped as the next big star of women ' s tennis , is expected to make her WTA Tour debut in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles Aug . 8-14 at the Manhattan Country_Club in Manhattan Beach . Her father , Richard , said he will seek a wild-card entry for his daughter if she maintains high marks in her schoolwork . &quot; And I ' ll tell you something , her grades are ahead of where they should be , &quot; he said . &quot; So , if I had to make that decision right now , she would play . She ' s going_out of her way to bring her grades ( up_to ) exactly where they should be. &quot; Said Jan Diamond , director of the Manhattan Beach tournament : &quot; If she plays our event , we ' d be ecstatic . I ' ll keep my fingers crossed. &quot; Williams , 6-feet-2 and 130 pounds , was born in Long_Beach and grew_up in Compton before moving with her family to Florida almost three years ago . She will turn 14 on June 17 . Her father said she will be brought along slowly . &quot; At 14 , Venus probably will play one or two tournaments , &quot; he said . &quot; At 15 , she will be allowed to play about four or five . At 16 , if she ' s doing very well , she can turn professional , but she shouldn ' t play more_than eight or nine . At 17 , she can play full time. &quot; Said Diamond : &quot; We don ' t mind having the exclusive ( this year ) . &quot; Tennis Notes Local qualifying for the Prince Cup , a national doubles tournament for amateurs , will be held today at La Canada Flintridge Country_Club . Details : ( 818 ) 790-4318 . . . . Three &quot; opportunity &quot; tournaments -- July 6-10 at Rancho San Clemente Tennis &amp; Fitness Club , July 13-17 at the Beverly Hills Tennis_Club and July 20-24 at Rancho Valencia Resort -- will send their winners into qualifying play for the Toshiba tournament , a WTA Tour event Aug . 1-8 at La Costa Resort &amp; Spa in Carlsbad . . . . Boris Becker , ranked among the top 10 this week for the first time since November , is scheduled to make a rare Southland appearance in the Los Angeles Open Aug . 1-7 at UCLA . Becker won titles at Indian Wells in 1987 and ' 88 , but the three-time Wimblebon champion has never played in the L.A. Open . Among others scheduled to compete are Andre Agassi , who won the tournament in 1988 , and Michael Chang , a finalist in three of the last five years .
