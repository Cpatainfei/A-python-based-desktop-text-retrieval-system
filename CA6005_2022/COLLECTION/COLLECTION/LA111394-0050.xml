   <HEADLINE> RECORD RACK : IN BRIEF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Queensryche , &quot; Promised Land , &quot; EMI * * * . Edgy , brooding , grand sonic gestures and gusts of harmonies continue to sweep_over Queensryche ' s hard-rock terrain.But in the two years since their last album , they ' ve tempered their songs , revealing some subtle new dynamics . &quot; Promised Land &quot; covers much territory , from stretches of introspection and social commentary to quiet acoustic moments and epic compositions . New albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) , two stars ( fair ) , three stars ( good ) and four stars ( excellent ) . Sandy Masuo</TEXT>
