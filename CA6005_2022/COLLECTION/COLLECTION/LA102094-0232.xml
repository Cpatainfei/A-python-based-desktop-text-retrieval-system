   <HEADLINE> FINDING THE SALT OF THE EARTH AT OSAKA KAPPO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kansai ( literally , &quot; west of the barrier &quot; ) is the large district of Honshu where many of Japan ' s major cities , such_as Kyoto , Kobe and Osaka , are concentrated . To devotees of Japanese cooking , kansai means earthy , assertive flavors , with more salt and less soy than in other parts of Japan , all served with a roll-up-your-sleeves informality . It ' s my favorite part of Japan for eating . A Tustin restaurant named Osaka Kappo specializes in the kansai cuisine of Osaka , prepared by the firm hand of a master chef named Itsuki . Kappo are small dishes designed to accompany beer or sake -- Japanese-style pub food , if you will . Itsuki-san ( as he is known , using the honorific commonly attached_to Japanese surnames ) will prepare sushi if you insist , but asking_for sushi misses the point of this kitchen by a country mile . Coming_to Osaka Kappo for sushi is like going_down to the wharf for a juicy steak . That goes double when you consider that this may be the best Japanese food Orange County has yet seen . Sitting at the counter the other night , I got_into a discussion with a self-styled Japanese gourmet , a native of Osaka . &quot; I eat_in all_the best Japanese restaurants in Southern California , &quot; he confided , &quot; and no one can duplicate the taste of Osaka like Itsuki-san. &quot; I second that emotion . Itsuki-san makes a wonderfully smoky dashi , the broth of mushroom , seaweed and shaved bonito that is the heart of Japanese cooking , and has a subtle touch with cooked dishes . For instance , one evening I ordered tara ( butterfish ) and waited , expecting an ordinary piece of broiled fish . But what was handed me over the counter was a slice of the flaky , rich fish , skin on , on a limpid pool of spicy yuzu ( Japanese citrus ) sauce . The fish came topped with a lightly browned cloud of egg_white embedded with a basil-like herb called mitsuba . Three slices of exquisite matsutake mushroom hid_out in the cloud , waiting to be discovered . If a chef like Nobu Matsuhisa , the bicoastal star of Matsuhisa in Los Angeles and the newly opened Nobu in New York , were to add this dish to his menu , he ' d probably get national attention for it . But here in a quiet part of Tustin , Itsuki-san has to content himself with the gratitude of a nearly all-Japanese clientele . It doesn ' t help matters that most of Osaka Kappo ' s menu is in Japanese , either . The menu has a printed apologia : &quot; Kappo dishes are hard to translate , &quot; it says . But the fact is that on a 133-item menu , the dishes numbered from 56 to 133 are written in Japanese , and that doesn ' t even take_into_account the specials blackboard at the back of the restaurant , which is also entirely , maddeningly , in Japanese . Osaka Kappo is a modest place , just a_few tables and a long curved counter . The decor is limited to a_few ceramic plates ( one emblazoned with a tengu , or demon ) and a bunch of watercolors depicting golf scenes . Itsuki-san works with a staff of about eight . Some of the hot dishes , such_as noodles in iron pots , come_out of a rear kitchen . Four chefs work_up front in_full_view , assisting the master . Order an alcoholic_beverage and you ' ll be given a dish of edamame , delicious cooked soybeans that you pop into your mouth direct from the pod . Ask the waitress for ankimo , creamy monkfish liver . It is the Japanese equivalent of foie_gras , and a_few pink slices make a masterful beginning for a meal . From there , you might move_on to a dish of simply grilled Japanese eggplant or perhaps yudofu , hot squares of tofu eaten with grated carrot and radish . Both can be ordered in English , though as it happens , neither is_on the_English part of the menu . There are good things on the_English menu , too . One is written_down as aspara bataa yaki , another as anago shichimi yaki . The first is a hearty roulade of grilled , marinated beef and asparagus . The beef is soft and the vegetables crunchy , resulting in lots of textural fun . The second is truly wonderful -- lightly grilled saltwater eel , sprinkled with orange- and pepper-flavored shichimi , which means &quot; seven spices. &quot; Kappo bento is a dinner box containing several Japanese delicacies . In the box you find a light tempura of fish and vegetables flanked by perfectly cut pieces of marinated and grilled beef , rice and pickles . On the side , you ' ll get a cup of chawan mushi , an ethereal Japanese savory custard with a surprise at the bottom : gingko nuts , chicken and sweet shrimp . You also get okara , a fluffy dish made from a byproduct of tofu -- in_effect , the whey , separated_out from the milk of the soybean . Finish a meal here by insisting on chazuke ( not available from the_English menu ) , a hot iron pot filled with broth , cooked rice , tiny pearls of crisp rice , a meat or fish of your choice and a healthy dose of hot tea . When I was married and living_in Tokyo , my late father-in-law , a proper Tokyo businessman , chastised me roundly for eating chazuke in public . &quot; A gentleman never eats chazuke , except when he is at home. &quot; Maybe not in Tokyo . But in Osaka , and in all_of the Kansai region , for that matter , those restrictions don ' t exist , only the sheer joy of eating does . And at Osaka Kappo , joy is right across the counter , waiting to be handed to you . Osaka Kappo is moderately priced . Kappo dishes are $ 3.50 to $ 12.95. Dinner boxes are $ 11.75 to $ 14.75. Combination dinners are $ 7.25 to $ 9.25. * Times Line : 808-8463 To check an Orange County restaurant by name to see if The Times has reviewed it recently , call TimesLine and press * 6170 For other weekly recommendations from Max Jacobson , press * 6160 * OSAKA KAPPO * Tustin Plaza , 13861 Newport Ave. , Tustin . * ( 714 ) 730-7051 . * Lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday ; dinner 5:30 to 10 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday .
