   <HEADLINE> BIRTH_DEFECTS IN GULF VETS ' BABIES STIR FEAR , DEBATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ten babies have died here already . The children of Persian_Gulf_War veterans , they died of heart defects and liver cancer . One was born with no spleen . Three were stillborn . Their short , tragic lives -- chronicled neatly by their mothers in family photo albums -- are raising new fears that the mysterious Gulf War syndrome , an inexplicable , untreatable collection of afflictions that reportedly have touched thousands who fought in the desert , is now being passed_on to the next generation . Here at Ft . Bragg , home to the Army ' s 82nd Airborne Division , veterans ' wives learned almost by accident that they were not the only ones mysteriously losing children . Some by chance struck_up casual conversations with other grieving mothers at the beauty_shop ; others traded stories at the grocery . The Ft . Bragg experience is being repeated all_over the United States . With some groups believing that as_many as 65 % of the children born to Gulf War soldiers are suffering in some form or another , veterans and their spouses are growing confused and angry -- and are increasingly refusing to have more children . Noting that it took the government 20 years to acknowledge that Vietnam_War veterans were harmed by exposure to Agent_Orange , they worry that their lives are being ruined by a Pentagon that has yet to draw any relation between the illnesses and possible exposure to chemicals or other toxins . &quot; If they could give me some sort of medical reason , I might not feel this way -- but I am very angry , &quot; said Malulani Patrick of Fayetteville , whose child , Logan Jacob , was stillborn a year after the Gulf War ended . &quot; This was my first baby , and our son ' s death really tore us apart. &quot; Defense_Department officials say that while they deeply sympathize_with the ailments and deaths , they have yet to pinpoint a cause . They maintain that unless more research shows otherwise , U.S. soldiers in the Gulf were not exposed to life-threatening chemicals or other toxic agents , from either the U.S. military or the regime of Iraq ' s Saddam Hussein . Air_Force Lt . Col . Doug Hart , a Pentagon spokesman on health and personnel matters , says some studies suggest that the infant deaths and birth abnormalities are in_line with expected percentages in the general population . But don ' t tell that to the mothers of Waynesboro , Miss. , site of a National_Guard quartermaster corps . There , 13 of the 15 children born to returning Gulf War veterans suffer from serious birth_defects . Dennis West said his daughter , Reed , was born prematurely with collapsed lungs and a faulty immune_system that leaves her almost defenseless against pneumonia and bronchitis . Aimee Miller said her son , Joshua , came_down with strange colds , pneumonia and high fevers . A simple mosquito_bite caused his face to swell and his eyes to close shut . Some nights he would wake_up in a raging fit and run_through the house . Infant_mortality_rates have suddenly increased among Gulf War veterans in four counties in Kentucky and Tennessee , home base of the Army ' s 101st Airborne Division ; in three counties in Georgia that support the Army ' s 197th Infantry Division , and at Ft . Hood in Texas . Here in Fayetteville , Melanie Ayers lost her 5-month-old son , Michael . Except for some unusual sweating bouts , he had seemed a healthy child . Then , during a restless sleep one night last summer , he stopped breathing . And while Ayers frantically drove him to the hospital , he died . &quot; It ' s very frustrating the way people are just patronizing to us , &quot; she said . &quot; They pretend they understand our anguish . But we ' re getting more upset with government officials coming out and saying how confusing this all is but doing nothing to solve it . &quot; I ' m not out_to point my finger at the government . But it ' s been over a year now , and all I want is for them to tell me why my son died. &quot; That the Pentagon still cannot do , although spokesman Dennis Boxx says the government is pursuing the_matter &quot; very aggressively on a number of fronts. &quot; &quot; We do not have any indication at this point that these things are transmittable to children or spouses , &quot; Boxx said . &quot; But we have not ruled_out the possibility . We simply cannot . Because if we cannot diagnose it and describe what it is , we then cannot tell you that it is not transmittable. &quot; Hart , the Air_Force spokesman , said the Pentagon is continuing to gather and examine statistics on health matters from Gulf War veterans and is comparing them with data from soldiers who did not go_to the Gulf , as well as accumulating other data on the long list of ailments that have touched the soldiers and their families . He noted that a study by the Mississippi State_Department of Health , which analyzed the incidents of birth_defects in Waynesboro , came_up with initial findings that indicated a normal rate of birth_defects for the group there . Yet the phenomenon persists . About a year after the war ended in early 1991 , veterans began complaining of strange diseases . Rashes , nausea , headaches , even more severe ailments such_as blood_clots and cancers were revealed . Pentagon , veterans affairs and private medical experts remain at_a_loss to explain the problems , let alone determine if they are in any way related to service in the Gulf War . In hearings before Congress , the sick veterans charged that they were carelessly exposed to dangerous toxins and that the government knew of the health risks and was trying to cover them up . Government officials deny this . But Congress passed a Gulf veterans aid bill , signed this month by President Clinton , that authorizes payments to veterans who are chronically ill with undiagnosed disabilities that surfaced during or after the war . The President , while noting that the illnesses cannot yet be medically explained , added that this &quot; should not stop us from providing an expeditious and compassionate response to these veterans ' needs. &quot; However , the bill did not extend assistance to the veterans ' families , something many angry parents hope to push_through Congress next year . Meanwhile , a special Gulf War registry continues to document the individual cases of veterans . Of the 697 # 000 soldiers sent to the region , about 29 # 000 have signed_on to the VA ' s registry . But it is the new indications that the disease is spreading to children that alarms many who are racing to find an explanation . Experts in the private sector theorize that U.S. troops may have been harmed by any of a wide range of chemical or biological agents ; by uranium , sandfly_fever or oil fires ; or by anti-nerve-gas medications . When they returned home and began reporting their symptoms , some of their wives also began coming_down with similar rashes , fatigue and other ailments . Strangest of all , many wives complained -- and still complain -- of burning urinary_tract and vaginal infections after having_sex with their husbands . They also said their husbands produced &quot; burning semen &quot; that burns the skin when it is touched . And while many of the ill veterans and their families now live together in military communities such_as Fayetteville and Waynesboro , the husbands did not necessarily serve together in the Gulf region . Rather , they were spread_out in different units around the Gulf area , raising the possibility that any toxic exposure may_not be confined to just one group of troops . Further befuddling to researchers is the fact that some of the fathers of ill or dying children have similar ailments while others seem perfectly fine . But one thing is clear : In recent months have come slow but mounting indications that the illnesses -- particularly those of the children -- might be related to the Gulf War experience . Dr. Ellen Silbergeld , a molecular toxicologist at the University of Maryland , told a congressional hearing in August that scientists now know that men exposed to toxic chemicals can pass the poison directly to their children through semen . What is frightening , she said , is that the chemicals can cause genetic mutations to the sperm that helps conceive the child . Exactly why this occurs , she added , is the &quot; question we know the least about. &quot; Dr. Francis J . Waickman , an Akron , Ohio , environmental pediatrician , compared birth-defect statistics of Gulf War_babies and other children . He found a 30 % rate of abnormalities among the children of Gulf veterans -- &quot; probably tenfold of what is in the normal population , &quot; he said . But as experts delve further into the issue , he said , more questions pop_up . &quot; Can it be passed_on ? The answer is yes , insofar as we have hard evidence that chemicals can absolutely decrease numbers of sperm . &quot; It can create an infant whose immune_system does not function normally , and as a consequence this can be a cause for the increased incidence of infections in these children . &quot; But does this alter genes ? And can this occur when you have severe chemical exposure ? &quot; He answered his questions this way : &quot; To my knowledge , this is the first time we ' ve ever had such a large group exposed to a possible large degree of chemicals , so we better learn from this whole series of events. &quot; Betty Mekdeci , founder and director of the Assn . of Birth_Defect Children in Orlando , Fla. , is also studying the illnesses and deaths . Her group is circulating 10 # 000 questionnaires to Gulf War families in search of information that will be thoroughly dissected in a search for trends and patterns . What she hopes to determine is whether the ailments and fatalities are linked to the war . &quot; These families need to know , &quot; she said . &quot; They need answers now on whether they should have more children. &quot; In addition , a recent report by the government ' s General Accounting Office identified three factors -- pesticides , oil fires and decontaminating agents -- that were present in the war environment and may have caused &quot; reproductive dysfunction &quot; in the soldiers . But how direct and widespread the exposure was remains debatable . &quot; The studies performed to date are unfinished , &quot; the GAO said , &quot; cannot be generalized , or are too weak methodologically to demonstrate convincingly that there are or are not abnormally high reproductive dysfunction rates among Persian_Gulf veterans and their families. &quot; It is this kind of lingering doubt that continues to confuse the parents of the ill and dying . The only thing they know for_sure is that their children born before the war are fine , but those who came later are not . Kim Sullivan of Fayetteville , whose son , Matthew Adam , died in his sleep at 10 months , said he had seemed fine since birth . But after his death last year , doctors discovered cancer that ruptured his liver and caused him to hemorrhage . Sullivan has since learned that it is extremely rare for children to contract liver cancer , and she said she has been told that &quot; it is not likely but is also not unheard of &quot; that there could be a Gulf War connection . She opened a photo album and showed pictures of her seemingly healthy son , one taken shortly before his death . Not knowing , she said , is the worst pain of all , and until she knows , her dream of having more children is_on hold . &quot; I guess not until I ' m brave enough to know I could handle a death , &quot; she said . &quot; I guess that ' s hardhearted , but that ' s the way it is. &quot;</TEXT>
