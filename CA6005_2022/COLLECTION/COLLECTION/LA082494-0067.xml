   <HEADLINE> OPENING EARS TO URBAN AFRICAN POP ; WORLD MUSIC : TABU LEY ROCHEREAU , WHO PERFORMS TONIGHT IN LONG_BEACH , IS A MISSIONARY OF SOUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first taste of stardom came early to Tabu Ley Rochereau , when he played before a huge crowd -- including an assortment of dignitaries , the king of Belgium among them -- celebrating the 1955 opening of a new soccer stadium in Leopoldville , Belgian_Congo . City and nation long since have been known as Kinshasa and Zaire , respectively , and the stadium went_on to gain a measure of fame in 1974 as site of one of the most celebrated boxing matches ever , the &quot; rumble in the jungle &quot; between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman . But Rochereau , who performs tonight in Long_Beach , remembers best that long-ago day when the stadium was new . Just 14 , his public singing had been confined before then to family gatherings and baptisms at his church . But he was invited to take_part in a vocal competition to mark the stadium opening -- and he won . &quot; It was maybe 80 # 000 people in the stadium ; it was live_on radio , &quot; Rochereau recalls . Before then he was just another youngster , but &quot; that same day , I was very known. &quot; Newspapers and radio_stations called_on him for interviews . More important for the young singer , &quot; there was one big , big star -- we call him the father of modern Zairian music -- ( who ) called me to write a song for him. &quot; That was Joseph Kabasele , known as Le Grand Kalle , who more_than anyone was responsible_for creating a distinctive Central African sound that fused Latin rumba with Congolese rhythms . Rochereau began writing songs for him , at first without credit . &quot; When I finished my school on 1959 , I started to put my name on the records . The first song was ' Kalia. ' That song was very , very popular , even to now . Even the musicians from Puerto Rico , Cuba and all_over Africa , they put that song in their language and make a record with it. &quot; Rochereau and Orchestre Afrisa International play tonight on the lawn at the Long_Beach Museum of Art for the final concert of the museum ' s summer series . He was interviewed in late June on an earlier swing through Long_Beach , the morning after he performed during the FESTAC African-Caribbean music festival at Rainbow Lagoon . His singing has often been described as honey-voiced , but his speaking tone is deeper and more resonant . He chatted amiably in heavily accented English about his long career , pausing only occasionally to reach for words ( French is the official language of Zaire , although Rochereau sings most often in Lingala , the main local language ) . In a career than spans almost 40 years , Rochereau has released more_than 100 albums in Zaire and has written , &quot; I suppose , 2 # 200 , maybe 2 # 300 songs . Because every year , I make new songs for me and for other musicians. &quot; In the United States , Rochereau has been a steady presence on the touring scene and has even resided here periodically ( he lived_in Los Angeles for a spell in 1989 and is staying now in New Jersey ) . He is not as well known here , however , as Nigeria ' s King Sunny Ade , Senegal ' s Youssou N ' Dour or Mali ' s Ali Farka Toure . But it was Rochereau who opened Europe ' s eyes to urban African pop , with an astonishingly successful 1970 run ( extended several times ) of 26 performances in 18 days at the Paris Olympia , followed by a shorter engagement at the London Palladium . &quot; It was a big event for Africa , &quot; Rochereau said . &quot; It was the first time that a black star came straight from Africa with a band to play the Olympia . . . . Before me , it was Miriam Makeba , but Miriam Makeba was based here ( in the United States ) , and she played with American and Brazilian musicians. &quot; In the decade before his European breakthrough , he was building his stature as a Pan-African star with few rivals . After several years of writing , singing and touring with Kabasele ' s seminal African Jazz , he joined the band full time in 1959 ( other members at the time included Dr. Nico , who was Zaire ' s top guitarist until his death in 1985 , and Cameroonian saxophone player Manu Dibango , still an international star ) . When that band dissolved a_few years later , Rochereau and Dr. Nico joined forces , but &quot; only for two years , &quot; Rochereau said . &quot; Him and me , we were very young , and ( had ) no experience . After two years , we started over again. &quot; Both started their own bands -- Nico had African Fiesta Sukisa , while Rochereau led African Fiesta National , which eventually became Afrisa International . In the ' 60s , Rochereau created controversy when he introduced the use of a Western-style drum kit ( now widely accepted in Afro-pop ) and popularized elaborate , highly choreographed stage shows . * Later in the decade , Rochereau helped pioneer a new sound that continues to dominate Zaire and other parts of Central_Africa : soukous . Essentially speeded-up versions of the older rumba tunes , soukous are long , two-part songs with a lilting first section , in which the lead singer , later joined by a chorus , sings the main lyrics ; then in the second section , or sebene , the beat kicks into hyper-drive and the music is propelled by elaborately interlocking guitar parts that echo the traditional melodies of the likembe , a Zairian thumb piano . In the nightclubs of Kinshasa , audiences sit quietly for the first part of the song , then get_up and dance en masse for the second section . &quot; The first part is for lyrics and poetics , words , &quot; where the audiences &quot; listen to what the musicians are talking_about , &quot; Rochereau explained . &quot; After that , sebene comes , and people move. &quot; Many soukous musicians left Zaire in the 1970s and ' 80s to live and record in Paris , but Rochereau stayed until 1988 . He left on a temporary visa but stayed away as political and economic_conditions in Zaire worsened . His family is in Belgium . Rochereau also owns homes_in Paris , Kenya and South_Africa . * In Zaire , Rochereau and another enormously popular singer , Franco , had very complex relationships with the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko , who has held power since 1965 and is widely accused of destroying the country while enriching himself to the tune of billions of dollars . Rochereau and Franco were courted -- and held_in deep suspicion -- by Mobutu because of their popularity . Any song perceived as critical of the government was likely to land them in_trouble . Rochereau found himself in and out of favor while in Zaire . His decision to leave in 1988 and some of the songs he has recorded in Paris since have created further tensions with Mobutu . &quot; I left to record in Europe . . . but I stayed a long_time , and ( the ) government was thinking I had run_away . They called me to go_back , but I refused. &quot; Rochereau said he now is barred from returning . Since leaving Zaire in 1988 , he has been allowed to return only once , a 24-hour visit for the funeral of Franco in 1989 . Still , he shrugged when asked if it worried him . &quot; As a politician , he will change , &quot; he said . &quot; He needs me. &quot; Franco ' s death ( reportedly of AIDS ) ended an era in which the two singers sparred publicly through their songs . &quot; Sometimes he writes song , he talks bad of me . I worry , and I write a song for him , &quot; Rochereau said . &quot; Many times he was a rival , because he was working to be better than me. &quot; Privately , the two became friends , but the public enjoyed the rivalry , so it was maintained . &quot; One day he told me , ' You know , Tabu Ley , people don ' t like us to be friendly , because you and me we are like plane engines , you on right and me on_left , and we work to make the aircraft go_to the destination. ' It was one year before he died , he told me that. &quot; While touring this summer , Rochereau has also been putting the finishing touches_on an album for Rounder Records , his first recorded in the U.S. Scott Billington , who has worked with such New Orleans R &amp; B artists as Irma Thomas , Johnny Adams and the Dirty Dozen Brass_Band , produced the record , which will be released in September . One of his goals , Billington said in a telephone_interview , was to get_away from the heavily synthesized drum sound of recent recordings Rochereau has made_for the_French label Sonodisc ( some of which have been released in the United States by Shanachie Records ) . &quot; I wanted to get_away from tracks that were so computer-oriented . . . . There was so_much reliance on MIDI sounds , he was losing a bit of the spirit and excitement , &quot; Billington said . Rochereau , who has a full-time MIDI player in his band , took some persuading . &quot; We actually had some pretty heated exchanges , &quot; Billington said . &quot; In the end , when we finally got_down to mixing the record , we had a very good time . . . . &quot; I grew , as I got_to know him , to respect him very much , &quot; said Billington . Working with an African artist was new for him , but &quot; I ' m always looking_for people who have taken a roots-music style and created something new. &quot; * Billington and Rochereau agreed that while the new album is designed to reach a wider U.S. audience , it remains primarily a work for the singer ' s compatriots in Zaire . One song in particular , Rochereau said , &quot; is for reconciliation for all_the people in my country . ( I want ) the people from government , the people in the opposition , everyone to sit together to talk good , to push our country to go_ahead . I think they will be happy. &quot; * Tabu Ley Rochereau &amp; Orchestre Afrisa International perform tonight at the Long_Beach Museum of Art , 2300 E . Ocean Blvd. , Long_Beach . 7 p.m. Grounds open at 6 p.m. for dining . $ 8 to $ 10 , free for kids 12 and under . ( 310 ) 439-2119 .</TEXT>
