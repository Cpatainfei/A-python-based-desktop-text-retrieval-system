   <TEXT> Turning nuclear-bomb waste into glass logs looked_like a safe and economical way to handle 35 million gallons of radioactive sludge back in 1981 , when the Energy_Department began designing a treatment plant in South Carolina . But today , the sludge -- so radioactive that it can kill a person in minutes -- remains in underground tanks at the Savannah_River nuclear_weapon plant . Six years behind schedule and $ 1 billion over budget , the Westinghouse Corp . plant is another year away from starting_up the glass melter . The plant is an &quot; embarrassment , &quot; acknowledged Thomas Grumbly , environmental management chief at the Energy_Department . While recent tests at Savannah_River have raised his hopes that its technical defects have been fixed , Grumbly worries that further maladies may be lurking . &quot; Murphy walks the halls of the Energy_Department , &quot; he said , referring to Murphy ' s Law , which holds that anything that can go_wrong will go_wrong . The problem with the melter is emblematic of a broad legacy of mismanagement and inefficiency that has dogged efforts to clean_up U.S. nuclear waste left from decades of frenetic Cold_War bomb production . From 1950 to 1990 , the federal weapon complex produced , on average , more_than four nuclear bombs a day , leaving_behind all_the waste in about 9 # 000 production buildings , tank farms , ponds , burial pits and other sites across the nation . Plutonium , uranium and other radioactive poisons have contaminated the soil at thousands of spots . Even with the best environmental practices , the waste will pose a risk to health and safety for more_than 10 # 000 years . Despite $ 23 billion in government spending since 1989 , the nuclear waste problem looms larger than ever and is more intractable , principally because federal bureaucrats badly miscalculated the depths of the problem at the outset . A recent General Accounting Office report lambasted the Energy_Department ' s performance , saying &quot; little cleanup has resulted. &quot; The decontamination of old bomb plants and management of nuclear waste is by far the largest environmental program in the world , costing taxpayers $ 6.1 billion this year alone . In only five years , the program has mushroomed into a massive commercial undertaking but without an industrial infrastructure , contracting system or technology base to fully support the job . In many cases , the Energy_Department has tied its own hands by signing legal agreements with states and other federal agencies , which it has neither the money nor technology to meet . As a result , the department has been left open_to a barrage of lawsuits that is usurping federal policy . Colorado sued when the Energy_Department couldn ' t meet its cleanup schedule . Nevada sued to keep_out Ohio ' s radioactive dirt . South Carolina went_to federal_court in an effort to block a shipment of foreign fuel rods . As matters stand , deciding which contaminated places to clean first &quot; is being left up_to courts and who has the most powerful congressional delegations and the meanest attorneys_general , &quot; said Bob Alvarez , deputy assistant energy_secretary . &quot; That is not the way we should be doing business . We have a regulatory framework that encourages this. &quot; A Curse on Future The Energy_Department emerged from the Cold_War a master at secretly cranking_out sophisticated nuclear bombs to protect America ' s national security , but it was poorly equipped to protect America ' s environment or to reassure a distrustful public . Although many federal programs have well-advertised failures , the consequence of bungling the cleanup of nuclear waste looms as a potentially toxic curse on future generations . Public attention and federal commitment could atrophy before the waste is safely contained , according to government and private experts . &quot; We can never look our children in the eye and say we have done a great job , &quot; said Arjun Makhijani , president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research , a Washington group frequently critical of the Energy_Department . &quot; What we have done so far points in the wrong direction. &quot; Estimates for the total cleanup cost are rising to staggering levels -- ranging from $ 200 billion to $ 600 billion . Some experts say that upcoming studies may put the cost at $ 1 trillion -- enough to buy every American family a new car . The Clinton_Administration came_into office with high hopes and an aggressive agenda to improve the process that began only during the George_Bush Administration . Clinton ' s commitment has won support from congressional leaders worried that the program has become unaffordable . Studies Assailed Grumbly is quick to acknowledge that his department has not done enough cleanup for the $ 23 billion spent so far -- a failure he blames on a management philosophy that encouraged interminable studies of problems before any actual work could begin . The result was &quot; spending a whole_lot of money feathering the nests of consultants and other . . . beneficiaries to the program rather than spending those dollars on the real environmental risks that we have , &quot; he said . Now Grumbly has promised Congress that his department will cut the cost of major projects by 20 % and has already proclaimed it will exceed its 1994 cleanup goals . The Energy_Department hopes to improve efficiency by opening competition on contracts worth $ 31 billion and has brought_in high-tech firms , such_as TRW Inc. and Lockheed Corp . to apply robotics and space technology . It is ending contracts that simply reimburse firms for their billings , which created little incentive to hold_down costs . It is also adding 1 # 200 employees to shore_up its relatively small staff of civil_servants who supervise and audit cleanups . Until recently , the department ' s environmental program had 1 # 800 employees overseeing more_than 42 # 200 contractor employees . The remedies , however , have had little time to show real results and strong evidence continues to mount that the cleanup is going poorly . &quot; We do not intend to shovel billions of dollars into this program without seeing some results , &quot; Sen . J . Bennett Johnston ( D-La. ) , a congressional powerbroker on nuclear issues , said at a hearing last year . &quot; To say the program has been mismanaged in prior years is . . . a vast understatement. &quot; The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board , an independent federal agency , has issued a series of reports finding poor safety standards , lethargic action and inadequate training . In a recommendation last May , it warned of &quot; imminent hazards &quot; of radioactive leakage from tanks , holding basins and pipes at sites across the nation unless action is taken within 24 months . Separately , the Congressional Budget Office has faulted the agency for investing just 7 % of its budget in new technology , despite its rhetoric to the contrary . The General Accounting Office recently called the department ' s decision-making process &quot; flawed. &quot; At Fernald , Ohio , for example , the Energy_Department wanted new management and hired a subsidiary of the Fluor Corp . But the Irvine-based firm quickly became the target of an acrimonious congressional investigation into charges that it billed taxpayers for a pricey Earth Day celebration , among other questionable spending . Oversight Blamed At the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico , the Energy_Department spent $ 1.5 billion on a burial pit that it cannot open because it never obtained the required regulatory charters . Authorities are still trying to determine whether the site can safely store uranium , plutonium and other wastes . In project after project , costs are out of control . Energy_Department cleanup programs have an average_cost overrun of 48 % , according to a study by Independent Project Analysis , a firm hired by the Energy_Department last year . Among IPA ' s findings : Projects suffer from repeated changes of managers , the department has not learned from past mistakes and it has lax control over the hundreds of cleanup programs across the country . &quot; DOE people have been trying to manage projects from 50 # 000-feet altitude , &quot; said Edward Merrow , the president of IPA . &quot; In many projects , there was no federal employee directly responsible . . . . &quot; What is at stake is whether we are able to do the cleanup . Unless the costs are brought_down , the cleanup will not get done . The costs will be unaffordable. &quot; Even when progress is made , the ultimate goals are unclear -- whether it is to ensure radioactivity remains safely confined to old bomb plants or whether it is to decontaminate those plants for unrestricted use . &quot; If you wanted to turn the entire nuclear defense complex into green fields on which we would let our children freely roam , there might not be enough paper down in the Treasury_Department , printed in any denomination , to do that now , &quot; Grumbly said . &quot; So , if that ' s your definition of cleanup , total green fields for the whole system , then I don ' t think even the $ 300-billion number buys that. &quot; A parallel problem is that nobody has agreed on what standards should be met in cleaning_up sites . Even with the best technology , some sites will have residual radiation above background_levels , but the Environmental Protection Agency has not been able to set safe limits . &quot; This is a place where as a society we do not have a consensus yet , &quot; Grumbly said . Sacrifice Zones Some heavily polluted sites , dubbed by critics as national sacrifice zones , will have to be sealed_off for hundreds , or possibly thousands , of years . Even now , the Energy_Department is spending nearly half its environmental budget on managing and storing the waste -- not on restoration . &quot; The federal_government has created profoundly contaminated zones that we don ' t have the money , resources or technology to restore to even restricted use , &quot; said Alvarez , the Energy_Department executive . Dealing with waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years raises deep questions . To begin with , it is unlikely that the Energy_Department or even the U.S._government will exist in a_few thousand years . The department has already lost track of where some radioactive waste is buried , raising questions about how it will keep precise records for thousands of years . Even posting warning signs at polluted sites may be a challenge because linguists doubt that the present English_language will be spoken in the distant future . Congress has more immediate concerns . For the first time since the program was launched in 1989 , Congress this year cut some of its funding . The Congressional Budget Office wanted to go_further , proposing a $ 630-million cutback . With a furor rising in Congress , the department is loath to ask_for yet more money . Nonetheless , Grumbly has begun warning of a &quot; fiscal train wreck &quot; in which the cost of cleaning_up all_the nuclear waste will outstrip the ability of taxpayers to foot the bill . Only a_few years ago , Energy_Department officials had projected their environmental management budget would rise to $ 14 billion annually by the year 2000 ; today the expectation is that the annual budget will rise little , if at all . With less money than expected , it would seem more urgent than ever for the department to address the biggest problems first . As simple as that seems , it isn ' t . The department signed about 100 legal agreements in the 1980s and 1990s with states and the federal Environmental Protection Agency to clean_up heavily contaminated sites . And since then , Congress passed the Federal Facilities Compliance Act , allowing states to sue the Energy_Department for noncompliance . Legal Disputes But the $ 6.1 billion in annual spending is &quot; woefully short &quot; of what is necessary to meet those agreements , and in many cases the government is failing , said Victor Rezendes , a key GAO watchdog . Indeed , at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last year , Grumbly testified that by the year 2000 , the agreements would require spending of $ 12 billion to $ 18 billion annually . Unable to comply with its own deals , the federal_government is embroiled in some nasty legal disputes . What ' s more , the compliance agreements have forced the Energy_Department to treat each plant as a separate program . To comply with a deal signed_in Ohio , for example , the Energy_Department wants to ship 16 # 000 truckloads of radioactive dirt to its Nevada Test Site , triggering an acrimonious lawsuit a_few months ago by Nevada officials who don ' t want Ohio ' s contamination . Harry Swainson , the state ' s senior deputy attorney_general , said the dirt would further contaminate a 20 # 000-year-old aquifer running_along Nevada ' s eastern border that contains enough water to supply a_million families for 800 years . &quot; We can ' t shame the federal_government into stopping these shipments , &quot; Swainson fumed . Among other problems , the dirt would be trucked through downtown Las Vegas , raising the risk that even a non-threatening incident or spill would generate horrific publicity that could maim the tourist industry , Swainson said . In many cases , the lawsuits and the risk of suits are forcing the Energy_Department to spend money in seemingly absurd ways . The department is spending about $ 500 # 000 a year pumping water at the Savannah_River plant to maintain an artificial_lake -- solely to comply with state regulations that have designated it as wetlands . The pumps originally drew cooling river water for nuclear_reactors , which have been shut_down for years . The water is discharged into what is known as L Lake -- an eyesore that has attracted fish and alligators . By shutting the pumps , the lake would go dry and kill the fish . To comply with state regulations , the department must continue pumping 25 # 000 gallons of water a minute into the lake , according to a Savannah_River plant spokesman . Leaks Urgent Meanwhile , 67 out of 177 tanks of high-level radioactive waste are leaking into the soil at the Hanford Reservation in Washington state , posing one of the more urgent contamination problems . The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board has advocated quicker action in dealing with the tanks . And at the Nevada Test Site the department has yet to conduct an environmental study of about 1 # 000 bomb craters left from underground nuclear tests that created serious radioactive contamination in the water_table , state officials complain . To deal with such inconsistencies , the Energy_Department is attempting to renegotiate the agreements , hoping to create a more realistic cleanup schedule . Colorado Assistant Atty . Gen . Daniel Miller said his state is being reasonable , talking with other states and federal groups to find an alternative to court fights . Nonetheless Colorado also brought an administrative complaint against the Energy_Department for failing to meet a 1991 cleanup agreement at the Rocky Flats bomb plant . The department paid a $ 2.8-million fine last summer . Political battles between state congressional delegations for cleanup funds are rising , said Alvarez . &quot; That pressure is there , and it is growing because of the amounts_of_money involved , &quot; he said . &quot; Progress is measured by how much you spend. &quot; But outsiders express it a different way : &quot; It is pork , that ' s the cynical way of putting it , &quot; said Merrow , the IPA president . &quot; Each site views getting their cleanup dollars in survival terms , and court_orders help them with that survival . . . by putting pressure on headquarters to keep money flowing. &quot; Meanwhile , the department is hoping to improve performance with new cleanup technology , like the $ 2-billion glass melter in South Carolina . Although transforming waste into glass -- a process called vitrification -- is widely supported , the department ' s approach has been controversial and costly . If the plant works perfectly , it would run 24 hours a day and fill its 5 # 000th canister with the last of the sludge in 2019 . But the plant has a far from perfect record . Du Pont Bows Out Chemical giant Du Pont &amp; Co . started the design work in 1981 with a schedule to start operations in 1989 . But after Du Pont got_out of the nuclear business , the Energy_Department concluded the plant had been designed to safety standards suitable for the chemical_industry , not the more stringent requirements of the nuclear industry . An evaluation and redesign by Westinghouse , the new management firm , took years . The plant ' s prospects began to improve until April , 1993 , when an accident revealed new flaws . During testing , the melter unexpectedly filled with water , triggering hundreds of alarms . A resulting Energy_Department investigation found that Westinghouse operators had become so accustomed to warning alarms that they failed to take appropriate action . The probe also uncovered inadequate training , poorly designed responsibilities for managers and the use of unauthorized procedures . A number of design changes were ordered as well . Westinghouse officials declined to be interviewed . Had nuclear waste been inside the plant , it would have caused a major contamination of the building , critics charge . Drying_out the melter caused a 10-month delay . Thomas Cochran , a scientist on the Natural_Resource Defense Council , criticized the design for having one melter rather than a series of smaller backup melters inside a single plant . And the safety board has cited such inadequacies as the plant ' s fire-protection system , its hazard warning system and its seismic standards . The plant , originally estimated to cost $ 1 billion , will end_up costing about $ 2 billion , not including another $ 2 billion in related treatment facilities . &quot; We could have built it cheaper , &quot; acknowledged Mario Fiori , the Energy_Department ' s chief at Savannah_River . &quot; It is academic . We need this facility . It is going_to operate for 30 years , and it is a technology we are going_to export to other Energy_Department sites. &quot; Compared to the cost of the nuclear arms race , projects like the melter might even be regarded_as a bargain . The United States has spent an estimated $ 4 trillion on nuclear bombs , missiles and command systems since World_War_II , said Stephen I . Schwartz , guest scholar at the Brookings Institution think_tank . A series of recent tests in which non-radioactive glass was poured from the melter were highly successful , said Steve Richardson , the chief government official at the plant . Waste processing operations are scheduled to begin in late 1995 . The Energy_Department plans to store the glass logs at Savannah_River only temporarily . South Carolina is adamantly opposed to permanent storage . Eventually , the Energy_Department intends to bury the logs at Yucca Mountain , Nev . In 1 # 000 to 10 # 000 years , the radioactivity in the logs would decay significantly and the problem would theoretically be gone . In the worst fears of the most staunch environmentalists , however , such repositories could leak radioactive waste into public water_supplies or , even worse , explode into a radioactive steam cloud that would annihilate life on Earth . Most experts believe that such fears are preposterous . &quot; The repository shouldn ' t be any more dangerous than a ( benign ) uranium_ore body , &quot; Cochran said . &quot; We shouldn ' t make society any worse off than if we hadn ' t mined an ore body to begin with. &quot; Nonetheless , Nevada authorities have been gearing_up for a future battle to block Yucca Mountain from opening , another roadblock confronting the Energy_Department ' s cleanup agenda . Swainson , the state ' s senior deputy attorney_general , has a suggestion for Energy_Department officials on an alternative burial_site for the glass logs . &quot; Let them bury it at the Mall in Washington , &quot; he said . &quot; We get a little bitter about this. &quot; Keeping Nuclear Waste Safe The search for safer ways to store radioactive waste has led to a process called vitrification , in which sludge is transformed into glass . Here ' s how the process at one site is supposed to work : 1 ) The plant has 35 million gallons of radioactive sludge in underground tanks , left by the production of plutonium and tritium for bombs . 2 ) The sludge is pumped from the tanks into the defense waste processing facility . Mercury is removed and 150-pound batches of sludge are mixed with 3 # 500 pounds of special sand , called frit , and chemicals . 3 ) The mixture is fed into a smelter , where water is boiled out of the sludge . A special filtration system captures any remaining radioactive particles from the steam . 4 ) The melted mixture is poured into stainless_steel canisters , which are sealed and loaded into a shielded transporter . 5 ) The cannisters , generating nearly as much heat as a 1 # 500-watt portable hair_dryer , are lowered into concrete pits for &quot; interim &quot; storage . Paying_for the Cleanup The Department_of_Energy will spend more_than $ 6 billion this year cleaning_up nuclear plants .
