   <HEADLINE> CYBER-DINING ON THE INTERNET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Along the information superhighway , a_few truck_stops have opened_up -- cyber-diners , where culinary travelers can drop_in to ask a question , find a new recipe or recommend a restaurant . The journey starts with the Internet , a global collection of interconnected computers that makes_up a virtual community . A community with a healthy appetite . Databases have files with a wide range of recipes , and on-line news groups answer all types of questions . For instance , &quot; I ' m posting to get some opinions on the various uses of different kinds of oils , &quot; one man recently asked . &quot; With so many different kinds of oils to choose from , one has to have a sense of why one oil is appropriate over another. &quot; Replies included : &quot; A good cannola and vegetable_oil blend , low in saturated fat , should meet nearly all your needs unless company is coming and you want to use a little olive_oil . Such a simplistic approach is healthy , thrifty and saves space in the kitchen. &quot; And : &quot; Peanut_oil is also often used for stir-frying . Peanut_oil ' s high smoke-point makes_it good for this. &quot; When a woman posted a message that she was at her wits end trying to clean her stainless-steel teapot , someone helpfully suggested a small amount of baking soda , a &quot; nylon scrubbie &quot; and elbow_grease . When a man wrote that he wanted to keep fresh pesto over the winter , he asked if it was possible to store basil , soaked in vinegar and topped with oil , in a jar in his refrigerator . Several people answering his post suggested freezing the pesto as &quot; pesto cubes , &quot; while others affirmed that it was possible to acidify the basil in vinegar and then set it in oil . * In cyberspace , someone seems to have an answer_for almost any question . Some cooks have found this out and now are using their keyboards almost as often as their cutting_boards . One of the best ways to start on the Internet is with an alt . or rec . news group . News groups , or users ' groups as they are sometimes called , are areas of the Internet used for posting messages . By first accessing a news service_program such_as NN -- a program usually issued by an Internet access provider -- a specific address can be used to get_to the message list . Once there , the messages appear , usually with the name of the author and the subject of the message . What ' s most interesting about computer messages is that they ' re not just dry questions and answers . Instead , the postings are lively and active -- like sitting around a kitchen_table with a group of friends . They can be caring , interesting , funny and intimate . There ' s always a personal tone to them . When one man asked where to buy 26 pounds of bacon , a woman responded with a cheery : &quot; Say hey Ray ! Well , there ' s that pig meat palace at the Housewife ' s Market in Oakland . Twenty-six pounds of bacon . What a lot of grease ! ! ! Sooo-weee ! &quot; * When he wrote back , he began with the greeting : &quot; Bless your little cholesterol-impaired heart. &quot; Another woman , after posting a long list of her favorite foods , logged_off with : &quot; See you in alt.recovery.dieting . &quot; There is a news group on the Internet for almost any topic or hobby , but the groups can be very specialized , and that can be a problem to the uninitiated . For instance , rec.food.drink.beer is a group that covers ales and beers . Dropping_in on their news group is like landing in a different country . &quot; GB is actually much more boring , and less imaginative than TH , &quot; wrote one poster . &quot; Boring if you don ' t like Exports and Dunkels and Doppels ! &quot; Came the reply from someone else . Rec.crafts.brewing is a news group that focuses_on home brewing . The group answers questions about yeast , making Trappist Ale or , as someone asked on a recent post : &quot; What exactly happens to make beer acquire this unwelcome character of ' skunkiness ? ' Is this phenomenon specific to green bottles ? &quot; A chemist wrote back : &quot; The skunking reaction is photochemical , and it ' s real. &quot; He said that he only uses brown bottles and described his own experiment when he left a clear bottle out_in direct sun for two weeks . &quot; Whew ! The odor was not subtle . It smelled like a dead cat. &quot; Rec.food.veg is a news group for vegetarians , and some are quite passionate about their life_style . When one woman discovered she had accidentally bought a sausage-flavored vegetable protein round , she said &quot; fifty hail-lentils as penance. &quot; * Other news groups include rec.food.sourdough , a group dedicated to baking the perfect loaf_of_bread ; alt.coffee for coffee lovers ; and both alt.bacchus and rec.food.drink for wine drinkers . Most groups have dozens of messages posted . The rec.food.cooking group is a news group that answers questions about cooking . . . any question about cooking . &quot; Has anyone accidentally ( or even purposely ) put metal in a microwave ? What really happens ? &quot; One answer : &quot; If the metal is near the side of the oven , the sparks can jump to the wall of the oven and cause damage. &quot; In this group , a series of messages on the same topic , called a &quot; thread , &quot; has been debating what is the most useless kitchen gadget . &quot; A pineapple peeler and corer , &quot; replied one woman . &quot; Mine is shaped and colored like a pineapple . A John Waters film is the only place for this thing. &quot; Another woman had no use for a ginger grater . &quot; I defy anyone to grate sensible quantities of ginger on one of these and not lose a knuckle , &quot; she grumbled . &quot; Mine is made of bamboo -- how appropriate for a device that seems to be designed as an instrument of torture. &quot; Rec.food.recipes is a group where cooks freely post their favorite home recipes . The recipe selection is an eclectic mixed bag , with a recipe for escargot butter followed by a recipe for pasta e fagioli . Cooks are very open about sharing their recipes . Either someone will post their favorite recipe , or a request will be made_for a specific dish . Usually within a_few days , an answer_for the request will be posted . Rec.food.recipes is one of the easiest ways to find recipes on the Internet . * Also available on-line on the Internet is the USENET cookbook , a collection of recipes previously posted in the rec.food news groups . After you access the cookbook , a list of food titles appear . The titles are listed by subject -- appetizers , barbecue , beef / veal and so on . Make a choice and you get a list of previously posted recipes . One of the most interesting topics from the USENET cookbook is &quot; miscellaneous , &quot; where you can get recipes for any type of celebration , and from various countries . A Mardi Gras menu is listed alongside recipes from Mexico and Thailand . Because the Internet is so vast , several search programs , which help find files online , have been developed . The most-used search programs are Gopher and its sub-program Veronica . They both operate in roughly the same way . Depending_on the Internet carrier used , you either call_up the search program by name at the prompt , or choose it from the Internet menu . The program asks_for a subject . After you type in a word or two , the program searches the computer_databases for the files or titles . When using the search programs , it definitely helps to be specific . When the word &quot; food &quot; was used as a topic search on Veronica , a list of more_than 200 entries scrolled down , with an additional 3 # 852 entries available . Not only were there recipes , but articles that just happen to have &quot; food &quot; in the title . Some were quite obscure : &quot; Effects of Different Types of Food on Fecundity of Predacious Mites , &quot; and &quot; Reaction of Young Carp to Food Flavors. &quot; * Food history is also covered on the Internet ; simply access the news group rec.food.historic . &quot; I have some 18th-Century English recipes that ask_for a quarter-pint or a pint of ' ale-yeast , ' &quot; said one message . &quot; I suspect what they mean is the sludge left in the bottom of the brewing vessel after the wort has been drawn_off , &quot; someone offered . &quot; A good friend of mine would like to do a banquet with a Byzantine theme , &quot; asked another poster . The only reply ? &quot; Me too ! &quot; * If the Internet seems too complicated , then try using one of the more commercial computer_networks such_as Prodigy , CompuServe or America Online -- which just recently added its own Internet gateway . Like the Internet , these networks have messages and files , but they ' re not as vast and are easier to move_around in . Each network offers a distinctive service . America Online has a celebrity cookbook in which users find recipes such_as &quot; Petula Clark ' s pots de cre me au chocolat , &quot; or the diet hints of such stars as Lauren Hutton ( she skips lunch ) and Linda Evans ( she has light_beer with dinner ) . Prodigy features a special guest chef whom users can message directly . This month , Nancy Harmon Jenkins , author of &quot; The Mediterranean Diet , &quot; is answering questions , as is Border Grill chef Mary Sue Milliken , who has been asked questions about black_bean cake recipes and chiles verdes . Not all questions are so up-scale . Michael Roberts , then chef at Trumps , was once asked to supply the recipe for the &quot; Bob ' s Big Boy fudge cake. &quot; All three services offer a &quot; chat &quot; section , in which users can talk to each other in &quot; real time &quot; -- directly typing messages to each other . It ' s similar to talking on the phone , but all words are typed . Of the three services , only CompuServe has a chat line that is specifically set_in the Cooks ' forum . * With words such_as &quot; byte &quot; and &quot; menu &quot; now common computer terms , it isn ' t a surprise that the culinary and on-line worlds would meet . A byte in cyberspace is as likely to mean something to eat as it is a piece of information . The following recipes were all downloaded from the Internet . * This is a very mild salad_dressing .
