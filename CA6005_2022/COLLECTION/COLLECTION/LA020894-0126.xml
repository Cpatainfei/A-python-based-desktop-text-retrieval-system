   <HEADLINE> PHARM REPORT / KATHLEEN DOHENY : WORKING MEDICINES INTO YOUR WORKOUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You hate to miss your workout but can ' t stop sneezing . So you pop a cold pill and head to the gym . But should you pump iron with that load of decongestants in your system ? You rarely have trouble falling_asleep , but last night was the exception . You took an over-the-counter sleep aid and snoozed away the night . Now it ' s 6 a.m. and you ' re raring to run . But should you ? Do over-the-counter medicines and exercise mix ? It depends , the experts say , on how much medicine you took ( and what kind ) and the extent of your workout . ( Consult your physician regarding prescription drugs. ) Even among pharmacists opinions vary . There is usually no problem taking cough and cold medicines right before a moderate workout , contends Alan Martin , president-elect of the California Pharmacists Assn . and owner of Economy Drug in San Luis Obispo . Other experts suggest that some medicines are_best taken an hour or two before exercise and that some are_best taken_after a workout . * Cold Medicine and Exercise : Cold and cough medications that aim to decongest usually contain stimulants . If you exercise soon after taking a dose , you might feel a rush of energy followed by fatigue as the drug wears_off . You could also experience a fast heart beat , nervousness , shakiness and a headache . Consider waiting an hour or two , says Sylvia Curry , director of pharmacy at Century City Hospital . Cough and cold medicines can also include antihistamines , which act_as sedatives . ( Don ' t count_on them canceling_out the stimulant effects of the decongestants , Curry says , noting that everyone responds to medicine differently. ) It ' s best to pick a cough syrup without alcohol , Curry says . But Martin counters that there is not enough alcohol in most over-the-counter cough syrups to have much effect on exercise . When taking cough and cold medicines with stimulants , though , it is wise_to reduce caffeine intake to minimize that &quot; hyped up &quot; feeling , says Dr. Kenneth Landis , director of pulmonary medicine at Centinela Hospital Medical_Center , Inglewood . * Allergy Medicine and Workouts : Most over-the-counter allergy medicines contain antihistamines , which can make you drowsy , slow reaction_times and impair coordination . Wait at least two hours after a dose to exercise , Curry suggests , or work_out beforehand . * OTC Sleeping Aids : &quot; Over-the-counter sleep aids usually wear_off in four to six hours , &quot; says Martin , making morning exercise likely to be free_of side-effects . * Cramp Pills : Take &quot; menstrual relief &quot; medicine ( such_as Midol , Pamprin ) after exercise , experts say , because the drugs act_as a diuretic , perhaps making_it difficult to get_through an entire workout without a bathroom stop . Be sure to eat potassium-rich foods ( bananas , orange_juice ) to replenish potassium lost with increased urine production . * Pain Medications : Taking pain medicine such_as aspirin , acetaminophen and ibuprofen before exercise might mask pain and set you up for serious injury , some say . But it can also reduce inflammation in an injured area and allow you to ease back into exercise . * Formula Options : The &quot; time-release &quot; formulas of over-the-counter medicines are probably a better option if you plan to exercise after taking them , Landis says . &quot; Slow-release forms are less likely to increase your heart_rate and elevate your blood_pressure , &quot; he says . Ask your pharmacist which forms are slow-release because not all may be labeled as such . The Common-Sense Factor : People with a tendency to anxiety or who have chronic conditions such_as asthma should be especially careful about mixing over-the-counter medicine and exercise , Landis says . Listening to your body is wise , too . &quot; People ' s response ( to medicine ) is variable , &quot; Landis says . Someone who rarely takes medicine might be more sensitive to the sedating effects of antihistamines , for instance . Regular exercisers often have a better-than-average ability to listen to their bodies and are likely to recognize side_effects promptly . * Natural Remedies : Consider natural routes to relief if your cough or cold isn ' t too_bad . Use a humidifier to decongest . Drink lots of water and get more rest to relieve congestion . Exercise itself might improve congestion , at least temporarily . * Caveats : Exercisers should make their physicians and pharmacists aware of their workout routines , especially if a new medicine is ordered . When buying over-the-counter medicines or filling prescriptions , ask the pharmacist what effect , if any , a dose will have_on your regular workout . Know when to stop self-treatment . &quot; Don ' t take a cough or cold medicine longer than five to seven days without seeing a doctor , &quot; Curry says .</TEXT>
