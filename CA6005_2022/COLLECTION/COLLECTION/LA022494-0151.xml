   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : RECYCLING HOT_LINE ADDS SPANISH SERVICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Officials operating a 2-year-old recycling hot_line have added Spanish to the telephone_service to attract more callers and to better alert the Latino population to the variety of recycling information available . The Ventura County Recycling Consortium , a group of public agencies and private businesses that promotes recycling , announced the addition Tuesday , saying the sizable Spanish-speaking community in Ventura County needs better access to the recycling services offered locally . &quot; By providing recycling information in Spanish , more Ventura County residents will have access to recycling information and ( that ) will allow_for greater participation in recycling programs countywide , &quot; said Jay Duncan , who coordinates the recycling program for Oxnard . More_than 25 % of Ventura County residents are Latino . County solid waste officials estimate that more_than 200 # 000 tons of wood , newsprint , glass , aluminum and other materials were recycled in Ventura County last year . But that represents just 20 % of the materials that could be reclaimed , according to Toni Moran , a waste management analyst for Ventura County . &quot; We have to do_better , &quot; said Moran , who estimated that the hot_line now receives more_than 100 calls a month . &quot; We have to increase that to 25 % by 1995 under ( state law ) , and then to 50 % by the year 2000. &quot; For information about various recycling programs or to find_out where or how to dispose_of hazardous materials , call 654-3935 .
