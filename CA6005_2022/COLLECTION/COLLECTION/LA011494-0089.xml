   <HEADLINE> ITALY PREMIER QUITS , SIGNALING END OF ERA ; GOVERNMENT : THE 73-YEAR-OLD FORMER CENTRAL_BANK GOVERNOR ' S TECHNOCRAT REGIME HAD SEEN THE COUNTRY THROUGH A PERIOD OF CRITICAL CHANGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi resigned Thursday , sounding the death_knell for an old-pals political_system that transported Italy from war-racked fascism to prosperous but corruption-scarred democracy . Italy ' s 52nd postwar government passed quietly in a half-hour meeting on a springlike afternoon between Ciampi and his friend President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro at the Quirinale Palace overlooking the Eternal City . But there was great ferment beneath the surface : With mainstay parties tarred by unprecedented scandal and the political center up for grabs , spring elections could bring left-wing parties to national power for the first time -- chief among them the former Italian Communist_Party . Scalfaro received without public comment the resignation of the 73-year-old former central_bank governor , whose eight-month technocrat government has weathered a period of critical change while enacting some remarkable reforms . The Italian president meets leaders of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies today as a prelude to dissolving Parliament . Observers believe Scalfaro will ask Ciampi to remain at the head of a caretaker government until elections are held . Most analysts expect Scalfaro to set the election for March 27 and to have completed the transition details by Sunday so that Italy starts the business week with a caretaker government in place . The forcing of an early election underpinned an opposition no-confidence motion in Parliament , which Ciampi called &quot; an invitation to resign. &quot; The motion was withdrawn Thursday after two days of debate , but by then Ciampi had decided to go even without it . The independent , low-key banker who had never held political office or had any party affiliation has always portrayed himself as a transition figure . Scalfaro named him as a compromise leader acceptable to all sides after a referendum last April pulled the rug from under center-right political_parties that have ruled Italy without interruption since World_War_II . The referendum demanded electoral reform to replace a proportional system that resulted in an unending procession of weak coalition governments . They in turn produced a system of party control that extended not only to Parliament but also to a national web of state-controlled enterprises from banks to television channels to huge industrial conglomerates . The system came_to depend_on a foundation of illegal patronage and kickbacks for government contracts . A two-year investigation of massive political bribery has uncovered billions of dollars in nationwide payoffs involving all major parties and many of Italy ' s largest companies . * More_than 3 # 000 business people , politicians and bureaucrats are under investigation or in jail . More_than 200 senators and deputies must face magistrates with hard questions to ask once their present parliamentary immunity expires . Under Ciampi , a mulish Parliament whose majority parties have lost public confidence reluctantly approved a reform under which three-quarters of the seats in both the chamber and the senate will be filled by the candidate who wins the most votes_in a given district . The change is intended to place more responsibility on individual politicians and loosen the vise-grip of party barons . &quot; The path is cleared , &quot; Ciampi told a year-end news_conference , saying that he would leave_office once the 1994 budget had been approved . Opposition forces joined with Ciampi supporters to pass it and new taxes aimed at reducing the largest state deficit and debt in the European Union ( formerly the European Community ) . Along the way , Ciampi ' s government also launched privatization of large government holdings , beginning with banks . It began reform of Italy ' s bloated and inept public administration and won agreement on labor costs that pleased entrepreneurs but alarmed unions . Inflation sank to around 4 % , its lowest level in memory . The Christian Democrats , the largest party and the dominant partner in every postwar government , had hoped to delay elections until June to give themselves a chance to regroup from scandal . But pressures for an early vote grew inevitable after municipal elections in December , in which candidates supported by the Democratic Party of the Left , the former Communists , swept major cities . Votes for candidates backed by Christian Democrats and their coalition allies shrank embarrassingly almost everywhere . An insurgent northern-based populist movement , the Northern League , and the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement , profited from the protest vote . Polls show that the former Communists , who now call themselves social democrats , are the likely victors of a spring election . In postwar decades , Italian Communists served as mayors of virtually every major Italian city , but while the party was Italy ' s second-largest , it was always a bridesmaid -- denied a share of national power in all 52 governments .</TEXT>
