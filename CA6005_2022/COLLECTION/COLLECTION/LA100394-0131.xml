   <HEADLINE> JAPAN CENTRAL_BANK PROPS DOLLAR AGAINST YEN ; MARKETS : U.S. CURRENCY HAD INITIALLY FALLEN AS TRADE ACCORD WAS SEEN AS DOING TOO LITTLE TO CUT TRADE_DEFICIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. dollar , after initially falling , rose against the yen in early Asian trading today after the Bank_of_Japan purchased the currency to prop_up its value . The greenback had fallen on the view that the U.S.-Japan trade agreement reached this weekend won ' t do much to reduce Japan ' s massive trade surplus with the United States . But the greenback then rebounded to as high as 99.32 yen as Japan ' s central_bank intervened . In morning Tokyo trading , the dollar was last changing hands at 99.25 yen , up from 99.15 yen in New York late Friday . While shares of leading Japanese export companies rallied , Tokyo stocks were little changed at the opening . The Nikkei 225 benchmark average finished morning trading up 50.21 points , or 0.26 % , at 19 # 614.02. The dollar fell as low as 98.40 yen after Asian markets opened for trading in Singapore , on selling led by U.S. funds which had bought dollars last week in anticipation of a major breakthrough in the talks , traders in Sydney and Tokyo said . Activity in Sydney was light because of a public holiday there . &quot; There is a realization that what has been agreed on is fundamentally a breakthrough , but its impact on actual dollars in the ( trade ) deficit will be minimal , &quot; said Phil Jackson , a currency trade at Commonwealth Bank in Sydney . &quot; ( Agreement on ) auto parts is some way off , &quot; he added . Japan and the United States reached a compromise on Saturday aimed at expanding U.S. access to Japanese markets in most of the areas discussed under the so-called trade framework talks which began more_than a year ago . The agreement calls_for Japan to open its markets to imports in government-procured medical and telecommunications_equipment and in the insurance and plate_glass industries . However , the two sides failed to reach agreement on autos and auto parts , which account_for about 60 % of Japan ' s $ 60-billion annual trade surplus with the United States . Traders have cited Japan ' s persistent surplus as the primary source of the yen ' s strength against the dollar , as it leaves Japan ' s exporting companies with a massive amount of dollar revenue that must eventually be repatriated into yen . Shares of Japan ' s largest exporters -- auto_companies such_as Toyota Motor Co . and consumer electronics makers such_as Sony Corp . -- rallied . But those increases were offset by declines in shares of Japan ' s largest brokerages , which recently lowered their earnings estimates . Traders said they would continue watching the assessment delivered by currency markets . Changes in the yen-dollar exchange_rate directly affect the overall Japanese economy because a stronger yen hurts the competitiveness of the exporters at the heart of Japan ' s economy .
