   <HEADLINE> TURKS IGNORE PROTESTS FROM WEST , JAIL KURDISH LEADERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Turkish court sentenced eight elected ethnic Kurdish leaders to between 3 1 / 2 and 15 years in prison Thursday , ignoring concerns expressed in the United States and the West that they were being jailed merely for expressing their views on Kurdish rights . The military-dominated state security court in the capital , Ankara , accepted secret wiretaps and speeches to find six of the defendants guilty of working for the rebel guerrillas of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party , or PKK . Two others were sentenced to 3 1 / 2 years in jail for making separatist statements . They were the only two to be released pending an appeal . The military-dominated state security court in the capital , Ankara , accepted secret wiretaps and speeches to find five former parliamentary deputies -- Leyla Zana , Ahmet Turk , Hatip Dicle , Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak -- guilty of working for the rebel guerrillas of the banned Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK . The five all received the maximum sentence of 15 years . In addition , Sedat Yurttas received a sentence of seven years and five months for helping the rebels . Sirri Sakik and independent deputy Mahmut Alinak were sentenced to 3 1 / 2 years each in jail for making separatist statements . They were the only two to be released pending an appeal . &quot; What is being punished is Turkish-Kurdish brotherhood . . . . How can people call this democracy if this happens when we just say something ? &quot; asked Alinak in front of the steel gates of the Ankara jail , where the eight have been imprisoned for up_to nine months . Alinak , an independent deputy , retained his parliamentary seat . The other seven were all members of the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party , banned in June for alleged activities against the territorial integrity of Turkey . The ban automatically threw them out of Parliament . &quot; These heavy sentences are shocking , incomprehensible . These sentences will not help Turkey ' s image abroad or its integration with Europe , &quot; one Western ambassador in Ankara said . Diplomats said the trial will probably not divert European Union governments from concluding key negotiations this month on a 1996 customs union with Turkey . But the European Parliament has already suspended ties relations with its Turkey ish counterpart over the issue and may try to block any new legislation . The U.S._government is deeply concerned &quot; to learn of the court ' s verdict , U.S. State_Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said . The Turkish government insists that it has the right to prosecute anybody linked to Kurdish rebels , who have used terrorist methods in a 10-year-old war aimed at self-determination for Turkey ' s 12 million Kurds . It has recently rejected renewed calls_for peace by the Syria-based rebel leader . More_than 13 # 500 people have died in the fighting .</TEXT>
