   <HEADLINE> AMNESTY UNLIKELY FOR HAITI LEADERS ; POLICY : ADMINISTRATION SAYS ONLY DEPOSED PRESIDENT CAN CONVENE PARLIAMENTARY SESSION TO CONSIDER PARDONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a narrow , new interpretation of the agreement that averted an American invasion of Haiti , the Clinton_Administration said Thursday that it is very unlikely that Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras and other Haitian military_leaders will get the amnesty from prosecution they are counting_on to remain in the Caribbean nation . According to Administration officials , only exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has the authority to call the Haitian Parliament into session to consider legislation giving blanket pardons to the military for crimes committed in the bloody Sept . 30 , 1991 , coup or in the three years of dictatorial rule that followed . Aristide , who says he is willing to extend amnesty for &quot; political &quot; crimes , such_as treason and insurrection , but not for &quot; common &quot; crimes , such_as murder and rape , is not expected to summon the Parliament in time to save his political enemies from jail or exile . Cedras believed that before Aristide returned he would be granted amnesty by the existing Parliament , which includes members whose credentials are questionable because they were elected after the 1991 coup . Without amnesty , Cedras and his lieutenants will face arrest if Aristide regains power , as he is scheduled to by Oct . 15 . That would give the military_leaders their choice of three very bleak options : * They could stand trial on charges that probably would produce long prison_terms or execution . * They could leave the country for exile abroad . * They could refuse to resign and try to hold onto power , a step that probably would be blocked by the vastly superior , 14 # 000-member American intervention force . There was no immediate reaction from the Haitian military junta Thursday night . The reinterpretation of the amnesty provision -- done unilaterally and which likely was most swiftly conveyed to Haiti via television_news broadcasts -- was part of a concerted effort by the Administration to snatch away some of the concessions former President Jimmy_Carter gave to Cedras and his deputy , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby , during arduous negotiations last weekend . The seven-point agreement Carter reached with Cedras and Biamby on Sunday seemed to offer the Haitian generals far more_than President Clinton was willing to give . When Clinton dispatched Carter , retired Gen . Colin L . Powell and Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) to make one final diplomatic attempt to head_off an imminent invasion , the President said the delegation could only discuss the &quot; modalities &quot; by which Cedras , Biamby and Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois , the Port-au-Prince police_chief , would surrender power and leave Haiti . The President said the three must go -- the only question was whether their departure would be peaceful or as a result of military_force . Instead of sticking_to his narrow mandate , Carter negotiated a deal that called_for the three officers to retire from the military by Oct . 15 . But it let them remain in their posts during the interim , and it did not require them to leave the country . The agreement also seemed to promise an immediate lifting of the economic embargo imposed by the U.N. Security_Council . Clinton accepted the Carter plan because it allowed American forces to enter Haiti unopposed and because it permitted Aristide to regain the presidency within a little less than a month . But , Administration officials said Thursday , the President ordered State_Department lawyers to probe the pact for possible loopholes . The Administration announced earlier this week that the economic embargo will remain in_force until Aristide is back in power . The Carter-brokered agreement said the sanctions &quot; will be lifted without delay in accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions. &quot; Those resolutions specify that the embargo will be lifted only after Aristide regains the presidency . Carter ' s agreement to extend a blanket pardon to Cedras , Biamby , Francois and other members of the military caused more consternation . Aristide complained bitterly about that provision , which his advisers said could set the stage for a new coup . But on Thursday , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry announced an Administration interpretation that finessed both the amnesty and exile issues . &quot; The arrangements that were made last Sunday included general amnesty , but that is very clearly one that has to be granted by the Haitian Parliament , &quot; McCurry said . &quot; Since they are out of session at this point , it will be up_to President Aristide to convoke a special_session of the Haitian Parliament. &quot; McCurry said the United States would question the legitimacy of any Parliament convened by Emile Jonassaint , the Haitian president who was installed by the military earlier this year . Other Administration officials said William H . Gray III , Clinton ' s special envoy on Haiti issues , outlined the Administration ' s interpretation to Aristide on Wednesday . The exiled president , pleased with the construction , endorsed the plan later in the day , ending a two-day sulk during which he pointedly failed to thank American officials for their efforts .</TEXT>
