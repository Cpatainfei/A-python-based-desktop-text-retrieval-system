   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; THE LIGHT OF DAY ; A SPANISH LITERACY PROGRAMS ARE BRIGHTENING THE LIVES OF LATINO IMMIGRANTS , TEACHING THEM TO BE MOE POLITICALLY AWARE AS THEY LEARN TO READ AND WRITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> AT A KITCHEN_TABLE IN HER SMALL WESTLAKE APARTMENT , Natividad Barrera pens the day ' s lesson : &quot; Housing and health are a right , &quot; she writes in Spanish , moving slowly from one letter to the next , as sunlight filters through a window of the run-down flat . Just as the sun brightens the dank room , so too has learning to read and write illuminated Barrera ' s life . Until a year ago , the 40-year-old Guatemalan immigrant was illiterate in her native Spanish . Unable to write her name or read street_signs , Barrera says she lived_in virtual darkness . But her life changed after she enrolled in one of a handful of Spanish literacy programs for Latino immigrants in Central Los Angeles . She now reads and writes in Spanish at about the second-grade level and is enrolled in English as a Second Language classes . For the most part , the literacy programs are run_by immigrants themselves . Many of them were activists in Central_America or Mexico who use techniques popularized in Latin_American literacy campaigns . Stressing themes such_as gangs , poverty and housing , the classes not only teach students to read and write , but also to become politically aware of issues facing their communities . &quot; We try to get them to realize that certain things are not acceptable , &quot; said Marcos Cajina , executive_director of the Centro Latino de Educacion Popular , a Temple-Beaudry nonprofit organization that has been teaching Spanish literacy classes since 1991 . &quot; Changes do not happen overnight , but students begin to question issues and think critically. &quot; Instructors say the literacy classes are the first_step in providing immigrants with basic grammar skills needed to eventually read and write in English . They say the programs offer a glimmer of hope in an otherwise dismal situation . A major federal study released in September concluded that nearly half of American adults are &quot; at risk &quot; of being left_behind in the information age because they possess the barest reading and mathematics skills . The study ' s authors said one reason for the bleak findings is the large_number of Latino immigrants who are not proficient in English . Some educators criticize the Spanish literacy programs for setting students back in their efforts to learn English . Regardless of their age , the critics say , students should be immediately immersed in English_language classes . &quot; There is no rhyme or reason why we can ' t teach in English , &quot; said Gloria Matta Tuchman , an outspoken proponent of English-immersion education and president of the Tustin Unified school_board in Orange County . But Spanish literacy advocates disagree . &quot; You just can ' t throw adults who have been illiterate for 20 or 30 years into a classroom and expect them to learn English , &quot; said Raul Anorve , a linguist with California Literacy Inc. , a statewide nonprofit organization that has funded and set_up reading_programs for more_than 50 years . &quot; If you learn to read in your native language first , you then transfer the skills you acquire into a second language. &quot; Though no hard numbers exist , literacy experts estimate that thousands of Latino immigrants in Central Los Angeles are unable to read or write not only in English , but also in Spanish . Statewide , a 1989 survey of 5 # 000 Latino immigrants found that they had completed an average of 6.5 years of school in their native countries . The survey was conducted for the California Department_of_Education to assess skill levels of Latinos who qualified for citizenship under the 1986 federal amnesty program . In El_Salvador and Guatemala , experts say , more_than two-thirds of the residents are illiterate , having grown_up in the countryside where work is valued over schooling or where few opportunities exist for those who want to learn . Many of those campesinos , or countryside workers , moved to Los Angeles during the immigration wave of the late 1970s and ' 80s . Among them was Barrera . One of eight children -- four of whom died of childhood diseases -- Barrera was relegated to domestic work as a child and teen-ager . Beginning at age 6 , she awoke daily at 3 a.m. to grind cornmeal and make tortillas for her dad and two older brothers , who worked the cotton and coffee fields . Other chores , such_as cleaning the family ' s dilapidated shack , cooking dinner and hauling water from a nearby well , would last into the evening , she said . &quot; My life has always been one of work , &quot; Barrera said , pointing to a thick scar across her neck from the yoke she wore to carry the buckets of water . Barrera , who came_to Los Angeles in 1976 and now makes ends meet by cleaning homes , said she wanted to go_to school as a child , but her father refused to send her . &quot; He said , ' You just want to learn to write letters to your boyfriends , ' &quot; Barrera recalled . A member of a storefront evangelical church in Echo Park , Barrera is now able to read her Bible during services . Before , she said , she just stared blankly at the pages . &quot; I read it for my heart and soul , &quot; said Barrera , whose goal is to improve her Spanish reading capability and eventually become proficient in English . The study released in September by the U.S. Department_of_Education found that Latino immigrants scored in the lowest of five levels that tested reading comprehension in English and math skills . The 26 # 000 test recipients were required to read newspaper_articles and brochures , balance checkbooks and calculate prices on lunch menus . Though it is not surprising that immigrants with limited English skills would score poorly , the results show that a major segment of American society is falling_behind in an increasingly technological world economy , said Irwin Kirsch of the Educational Testing Service of Princeton , N.J. , which conducted the test . The New Jersey firm also administers college placement exams . &quot; We ' re creating two societies -- those who can do , and those who can ' t , &quot; said Kirsch , director of the ETS learning and assessment group . And among those who will have the most difficulty adapting in the changing society , experts say , are immigrants who cannot read or write in their own languages , let alone English . To help bridge the gap in education in Central Los Angeles ' immigrant community , about half_a_dozen Spanish literacy organizations have sprouted up in the past several years . Most of them have developed their own primers and rely_on &quot; popular education &quot; methodology , which has its roots in the theories of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire , perhaps best known in the United States for his seminal book &quot; Pedagogy of the Oppressed. &quot; Popular education instructors teach students to read and write with words that are relevant to their daily experiences . For example , instead of using phrases such_as &quot; See Spot run , &quot; students write sentences using words such_as poverty , housing and racism . The idea , instructors say , is to prompt discussion on those issues affecting their lives and what they can do to improve their communities . The technique has been widely used in Cuba , Brazil and Nicaragua , among other Latin_American countries , to educate and politicize large peasant populations . &quot; Education has to be tied into the social , political and economic reality in which the students live , &quot; Anorve said . But critics say &quot; popular education &quot; is steeped in leftist doctrine . &quot; It is a very radical agenda , &quot; said Sally Peterson , director of Learning English Advocates Drive , an organization that has spoken out against bilingual education . &quot; Many of the instructors have an ax to grind and lose sight of their teaching goals. &quot; Though the Central Los Angeles literacy organizations are few compared to the need , they have changed the lives of some residents . For Paula Palma , a Guatemalan immigrant , learning to read also meant learning that she had a right to be paid a minimum_wage . The former garment_worker said she earned three cents for every blouse she sewed , making about $ 40 for two weeks of full-time work . Palma said she did not know about minimum-wage laws until they were discussed in her literacy class at the Temple-Beaudry nonprofit organization . &quot; I learned that if we work , we have to get the proper pay , &quot; said Palma , now a cafeteria cook at 9th Street Elementary School in Downtown . &quot; Now , if something is not right , I speak out. &quot; She is one of about 75 students who have attended the free classes at the Centro Latino de Educacion Popular , which was founded by Cajina in 1991 . A literacy teacher in Nicaragua , Cajina realized the need for similar programs here while working for a Downtown social_service agency . During the course of helping garment_workers file court grievances seeking back wages , he discovered that many could neither read nor write . The organization has two paid staff_members and several volunteers . It has received about $ 110 # 000 in grants from the Liberty Hill Foundation and Cal Literacy Inc. , among other groups and corporations . Liberty Hill and Cal Literacy also fund other area literacy organizations , including the Centro de Educacion Popular de Este Los Angeles in Boyle Heights and the Proyecto Educativo Comunitario in South-Central . The South-Central organization has taught 40 students to read and write since it started in late 1992 . The organization , which offers free classes , was founded by Roberto Bustillo , a former law_student and human_rights activist in El_Salvador . On a recent evening , at St . Columbkille Catholic_Church at 64th and Main_streets , six students learned how to pronounce different sounds created by vowels and consonants . &quot; Bla-ble-blo-blu , &quot; Bustillo said , pointing to the letters written_on a chalkboard . The students repeated : &quot; Bla-ble-blo-blu. &quot; &quot; What is the name of the material we use to build houses ? &quot; Bustillo asked_in Spanish . After several wrong answers , student Victoriano Melendez offered the correct response : bloque , which means block in Spanish . A native of El_Salvador , Melendez grew_up in the countryside and worked in the coffee , cotton and bean fields since he was 7 years old . The 38-year-old South-Central resident emigrated to the United States in 1977 and works_at a garment factory near Athens County Park . &quot; I don ' t know how I lived all these years in ignorance , not knowing anything , &quot; Melendez said . &quot; It was like I was blind. &quot; Melendez said he feels bad because he was unable to read bedtime stories to his daughter when she was little . He says she is now 21 , attending Cal State Fresno and considering applying to law_school . &quot; On the other hand , I gave her all_the support she needed , &quot; he said . &quot; And I taught her the most important thing : Have respect for herself and others. &quot; Jorge Ramirez , who is taking advanced classes offered by the South-Central organization , sums_up the feeling of many who are learning to read and write . &quot; It is beautiful to be able to know what is happening in the world , &quot; said the 43-year-old Mexican immigrant . &quot; To read a book , read a map or look_at the newspaper is a wonderful feeling. &quot; On the Cover Cuban immigrant Ana Hatch , 65 , takes_part in a literacy class at Malabar Library in Boyle Heights . Several literacy groups are reaching_out to illiterate Latino immigrants by teaching them to read and write in Spanish . &quot; Learning to read opens_up a whole new_world for these students , &quot; said Gaspar Verdugo , executive_director of the Centro de Educacion Popular de Este Los Angeles , which offers the free classes in Boyle Heights for Hatch and other Eastside residents . The Spanish literacy organization is one of a handful that have sprouted up during the past several years to bridge the gap in education in the area ' s immigrant community . * IMPROVING LITERACY : Roberto Bustillo , the director of Proyecto Educativo Comunitario , gave_up his dream of becoming a lawyer to teach Spanish language skills to Latino immigrants .
