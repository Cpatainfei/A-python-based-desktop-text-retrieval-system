   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT : STROBE TALBOTT ' S IDEAS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES ; NOW THAT HIS THOUGHTS AFFECT MORE THAN MAGAZINE READERS , THE SENATE MUST CLOSELY EXAMINE HIS PRIOR WRITINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Strobe Talbott , the deputy secretary of state-designate , was more_than a mere reporter during his days as chief diplomatic correspondent and editor-at-large of Time magazine . He was , rather , an advocate for a distinctive interpretation of the Cold_War , and particularly of its endgame . Now that he is playing a large , even dominant , role in formulating U.S. foreign_policy , Talbott ' s understanding of the recent past is of more_than antiquarian interest . For the way Talbott thought_about the collapse of European communism is clearly shaping the way he is thinking_about the future . And , as the recent NATO summit demonstrated , the way Talbott is thinking_about the future is likely to become the way the United States_government thinks_about the future of post-communist Central and Eastern Europe . Thus , senators questioning Talbott at his upcoming confirmation_hearings might well revisit some of his more provocative analyses of the history of the 1980s -- not to settle the ongoing argument about who won the Cold_War and how , but to determine how Talbott ' s understanding of the revolution of 1989 shapes his vision of U.S. policy in the 1990s . Senators so inclined might begin with Talbott ' s essay , &quot; Rethinking The Red Menace , &quot; from the Jan . 1 , 1990 , issue of Time -- the issue that proclaimed Mikhail Gorbachev &quot; Man of the Decade. &quot; Based on that essay , here are the questions it would be interesting to hear Talbott address : * Do you still believe that &quot; Gorbachev . . . had a near monopoly on the promulgation of bold ideas &quot; in the endgame of the Cold_War ? Did President Reagan or Prime_Minister Thatcher or Pope John Paul II have any &quot; bold ideas &quot; during the 1980s ? How about Lech Walesa ? Or Tadeusz Mazowiecki ? Or Vaclav Havel ? * You placed enormous stress on Gorbachev ' s role in breaking our &quot; grand obsession &quot; with the Cold_War . Psychiatry aside , how does your judgment on Gorbachev ' s singular role in the 1980s shape your judgment on Yeltsin ' s distinctive role in the 1990s ? We all want Yeltsin to succeed . But given his dire economic problems , we wonder why Yeltsin has proposed a Yalta II in which the West and Russia would decide the fate of East-Central Europe . Is Yeltsin vulnerable to neo-imperialist pressures within his reform coalition ? And if so , isn ' t that a more immediate threat than the ravings of Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky ? * Would you explain your claim that &quot; for more_than four decades , Western policy ( was ) based on a grotesque exaggeration of what the U.S.S.R. could do if it wanted to ? &quot; Did Harry Truman , Dean Acheson and Arthur Vandenberg &quot; grotesquely exaggerate &quot; the Soviet threat after World_War_II ? Did Dwight Eisenhower in the mid-1950s ? Did John F . Kennedy in 1961 ? Doesn ' t the suggestion that they did imply that the Cold_War was really the West ' s fault ? What does that implication suggest about U.S. policy today ? * You wrote that &quot; scenarios for a Soviet invasion of Western Europe . . . always had a touch a paranoid fantasy about them. &quot; Do Walesa ' s and Havel ' s concerns about a post-communist revival of Russian imperialism exhibit &quot; a touch of paranoid fantasy &quot; ? How do you read Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev ' s assertion of a historic Russian sphere_of_influence in east-central Europe ? Prior to the arrival of the Red Army in 1945 , when had Russia ever asserted an interest in Prague ? * You wrote that &quot; the doves in the Great Debate of the past 40 years were right all along. &quot; What role do you think NATO military modernization played in the endgame of the Cold_War ? How did the Strategic Defense Initiative influence Soviet negotiating behavior in the late 1980s ? What role does other states ' military_capability play today in shaping Russian understanding of the Russian role in East-Central Europe and in the &quot; near abroad &quot; of the former Soviet republics ? * Did human-rights activism behind the Iron_Curtain influence the collapse of communism ? Your own writings focus_on what happened &quot; at the highest level. &quot; Do you believe that democracy and the free market will be consolidated in Russia primarily from the top down ? What role do democratic and entrepreneurial activists at the grass-roots level play in stabilizing post-communist Russia ? Ideas , as ever , have consequences . Strobe Talbott ' s ideas could have great impact , for good or for ill , on the history of the 1990s . They deserve the closest critical scrutiny .</TEXT>
