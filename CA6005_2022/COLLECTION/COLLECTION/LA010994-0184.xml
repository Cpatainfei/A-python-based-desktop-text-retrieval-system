   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ; COMMENTARY ON SOCIETY ; U.N. PROCLAMATION PUTS FAMILY AT FRONT OF GLOBAL CONCERNS ; COUNTY PANEL PLANS TO MAKE 1994 A YEAR IN WHICH WE PULL OUR RESOURCES TOGETHER AND SHARE SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every new year brings with it hope for meeting new goals , the desire to bring_about changes that will improve the quality of one ' s life , and the determination to break habits and patterns that are self-defeating . In this regard , 1994 will bring a special challenge around the globe . The United Nations has proclaimed it International Year of the Family . The theme of the year is &quot; Family : Resources and Responsibilities in a Changing World. &quot; The motto is &quot; Building the Smallest Democracy at the Heart of Society. &quot; The underlying principles of the proclamation are : The family constitutes the basic unit of society and therefore warrants special attention . The United Nations recognizes that the family as an institution is the single most important means of perpetuating values nurturing individuals , building self-esteem and providing stability in any society . If we accept the premise that secure families determine the degree of society ' s security , we in Orange County have serious problems . The concern I hear over and over is the fear and insecurity people feel , in their homes and in their communities . There are crime , drugs , gangs and violence . We have children shooting children , children becoming parents , children abandoned before they have a name . Hate crimes and multiethnic tensions are impacting families and individuals across all sectors of our society . Families cannot rely totally on law_enforcement or the legal_system to solve the problems of violence . These problems have roots within social forces , but it is within the family that they are exaggerated or softened and contained . It is within the family that we should receive the basic training for skills that will help us live_in a larger &quot; family &quot; -- our community . We need to learn to share , to develop a sense_of_responsibility , to have tenderness and compassion for others , to be tolerant and accepting of individual differences and to be honest . When we fail to learn these values as individuals , the consequence will permeate our society , including political and social_policies . The values that we uphold today of competition , individualism , aggressiveness and materialism , if not tempered , are guaranteed to bring disappointment and a sense of chronic emptiness . I believe we need to balance competition with cooperation , individualism with individuation , assertiveness with empathy , and materialism with sustainable economics . When I read or hear the outcries about the eroding values in our society , I am reminded of what Aristotle taught 2 # 300 years ago . For an individual to achieve happiness in life and to live_in harmony with his society , one must build one ' s character on three values : to be temperate , that is , to curb our desire for excess and extremes ; to have courage and face our fears and the challenge to do what is right ; and to be just toward others . Christianity , 300 years later , added another value : to love one another . There are no easy answers to the problems facing families today . However , I believe that a strong and healthy family will generate strong , healthy adults who will be_better able to approach the increasingly difficult social and economic problems we face in creative and optimistic ways . Henryk Sokolski , who was named international coordinator for the year , said : &quot; Global concern for the family is not born of a nostalgic desire for simpler times , when rules and roles were less clouded by ambiguity , and the future less uncertain . Indeed , the so-called uncomplicated world of yesterday was in many ways not the sort of society we want to live_in tomorrow ; notably , for example , in respect_to the subjugation of women , the reprehensible exploitation of children , or the neglect of the elderly and persons with disabilities . On the contrary , the concerns which stimulated the International Year of the Family are very much a reflection of intensely contemporary issues , with real and substantial implications for the future. &quot; The U.N. General_Assembly , in proclaiming the Year of the Family , agreed that activities for the year should be at the local and regional level . In compliance with that declaration , the Orange County Committee for the U.N. International Year of the Family was formed . The committee comprises knowledgeable and diverse people whose common goal and commitment are to build strength and integrity in all families within the community . The committee is planning a number of activities throughout the year , including a week of family focus in schools and religious institutions , and a conference on health_care and parenting . Every Orange County city has been invited to participate in living room dialogues ( small multicultural , multiracial discussion groups aimed at further understanding of one another ) . There is increasing awareness that government cannot be relied_on to solve all_the problems of society . The goal for the year is to support families , to promote the inherent strengths of families , to build a family-friendly community , and to help families find creative solutions to problems within each community . Families can make a difference . Little can be accomplished in isolation , but with combined efforts , much can be done . However , there needs to be increased cooperation among government , businesses and volunteer grass-roots organizations . I am impressed by the large_numbers of groups and citizens who have been working diligently , although independently , to solve problems in creative ways . Hopefully , we can make this a year in which we pull our resources together , share our creativity and energy , and let each other know about solutions to problems . When I hear expressions of discouragement about the difficult task ahead , I am reminded of other &quot; idealistic &quot; efforts . It has been 30 years since the U.S. surgeon_general warned against the dangers of smoking , since President John F . Kennedy promoted physical_fitness . Little happened at first . The seed was planted long before it flourished ; but it did flourish !</TEXT>
