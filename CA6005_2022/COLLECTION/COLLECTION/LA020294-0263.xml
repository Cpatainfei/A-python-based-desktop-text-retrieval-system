   <HEADLINE> 39 RARE MICE MAY DELAY O.C. RESORT PROJECT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Tuesday that it has placed a small mouse on the emergency endangered species list , a move that could delay a proposed $ 500-million resort on one of the few undeveloped coastal properties left in Orange County . The Pacific pocket_mouse , rediscovered last year after not having been observed since 1971 , &quot; is part of California ' s natural heritage . They are an important part of the ecology , &quot; said Fred Roberts , a botanist with the service . Described as four-inch rodents that resemble hamsters , the pocket_mice were found during an environmental survey for the proposed resort_to be built_on the Headlands , 121 acres overlooking Dana Point Harbor . The development plan , which is opposed by local environmentalists , calls_for a 400-room hotel complex and 394 homes . The survey revealed that 39 of the rare mice -- believed to be the smallest member of the rodent family and perhaps the only ones of their kind that still exist -- were concentrated in about four acres of coastal sagebrush at the site . Once common as far as two miles inland along the Southern California coast from Los Angeles County ' s Marina del Rey and El Segundo south to the Mexican border , the tiny mouse has fallen victim to development and hungry cats . &quot; The urbanization of the coast all but wiped them out , &quot; Roberts said . &quot; They ' ve probably been at the Dana Point Headlands the whole time , but nobody ' s looked_for them. &quot; As far as scientists know , he said , the Headlands ' small population of Pacific pocket_mice constitutes the last remaining community of the species in the world . The emergency listing is &quot; really an attempt to restore the natural balance of things , &quot; said Connie Babb , a spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service . Under the listing , which took_effect Monday , developers will not be allowed to build without first convincing the service that construction will not further endanger the mouse . &quot; They would have to come_up with a habitat conservation plan built into this project that would show it would allow enough room to satisfy the scientists that the species could survive there , &quot; Babb said . While news of the emergency listing was not welcomed by the Headlands property_owner , a spokesman was confident the mouse would not change the project . &quot; We are certainly not happy about it , &quot; said Dan Daniels , president of the Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. , which owns the parcel along with the Chandis Securities Co . &quot; It certainly slows_down our ability to develop those ( four ) acres . The rest of the property , I would hope , would not be affected by this. &quot; Chandis Securities , a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the Chandler family , is a principal stockholder of Times Mirror Co. , which publishes the Los Angeles Times . The survey that rediscovered the mice was conducted by a biologist last July at the request of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . Originally , according to Daniels , the biologist had suggested that the landowner move the mice to a different location to save the colony because house_cats from nearby homes were already a danger to the rodents . &quot; Common_sense tells you that Dana Point is an urban environment and when development occurs the mouse is not going_to survive , &quot; Daniels said . &quot; If a long-term objective of the Fish and Wildlife Service is to have the mouse survive , it seems the only way to do_it is to relocate them to where people and cats are not around. &quot; According to the proposed Headlands development , which has been approved by the Dana Point Planning_Commission and will go before the City_Council , the area where the mice were found is slated for single-family homes , 3.5 to 7 units per acre . Joanna Craft , a spokeswoman for the city of Dana Point , said it is &quot; too early to tell &quot; what effect the listing would have_on the project ' s progress . A Feb . 15 public hearing on the plan still will be held . &quot; This doesn ' t change the process , but certainly we can ' t say it ' s not going_to change the plan . It could drastically change it , who knows ? We really don ' t know what the City_Council will decide or what other jurisdictions will decide. &quot; According to Babb , the emergency listing will be in_effect for 240 days , during which scientists will determine whether to recommend that the endangered listing be made permanent . Environmentalists , meanwhile , were expressing cautious optimism about this latest in a long series of obstacles to the development of what many consider a natural site that should be left alone . Ken Fortune , a spokesman for the local chapter of the Audubon Society , said he welcomed the listing as something that , while not likely to stop the project altogether , will probably delay it . &quot; I don ' t think ( the project ) is consistent with trying to preserve habitat , &quot; Fortune said . And Toni and Ed Gallagher , volunteers for Save the Headlands , a local grass-roots organization that is fighting the development , expressed hope that the federal_government ' s action would further complicate the property_owners ' efforts to realize their plans . &quot; We hate to see ( the landowners ) just steamroller in , right over the citizens , &quot; said Ed Gallagher , who has lived_in an ocean-view home on the Headlands for 15 years . &quot; They have a larger opponent to face now. &quot; On a stretch of untouched , ocean-bluff land behind a high chain-link fence topped with barbed wire and marked &quot; No Trespassing , &quot; meanwhile , sits the spot identified by biologists as the pocket_mouse ' s habitat . &quot; They tend to like ocean views and sunsets and very expensive pieces_of_land , &quot; said John Ballew , whose Costa Mesa planning and architecture firm , Ballew &amp; Associates , is project manager for the site , worth roughly $ 1 million per acre . Dale Savage , 32 , who has lived near the site for seven years , said she ' s never heard of or knowingly seen one of the rodents . But her cat , Jinx , drags home many creatures , including small mice . &quot; The only way I could see one is if my cat brought it home , &quot; she said . &quot; And then it would be dead. &quot; Times staff writer Anna Cekola contributed to this story .
