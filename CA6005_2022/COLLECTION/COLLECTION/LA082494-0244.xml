   <HEADLINE> VALLEY_FEVER OUTBREAK BLAMED ON QUAKE ' S DUST_CLOUD ; HEALTH : RESEARCHERS SAY THE VENTURA COUNTY CASES ARE THE FIRST KNOWN TO BE RELATED TO A TEMBLOR . AN L.A. COUNTY OFFICIAL DISPUTES THE FINDINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A cloud of dust rising from the Santa Susana Mountains after the Jan . 17 earthquake may have been responsible_for the unprecedented outbreak of valley_fever that struck Simi Valley and much of eastern Ventura County this spring , scientists say . After five months of interviews and analysis , scientists at the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control have concluded that residents caught in the dust_cloud were most likely to contract the flu-like ailment . Researchers believe that disease-bearing spores were stirred_up by landslides caused by the quake and its aftershocks , then swept with the wind across the county . &quot; The spores are often in the ground , but they ' re pretty much just sitting there , &quot; said Richard Spiegel , a researcher with the Atlanta-based CDC . &quot; Basically from all_the ground shaking , that unleashed significantly more dust than you might normally have. &quot; Altogether , 203 cases of valley_fever were diagnosed among Ventura County residents in the weeks after the quake . That compares to 52 cases for all_of 1993 . A 71-year-old Simi Valley man died in the 1994 outbreak . The CDC team will declare the Simi Valley outbreak the first known to be related to an earthquake when it presents its conclusions at a Stanford_University conference Thursday . But Dr. Shirley Fannin , director of disease control programs for Los Angeles County , disputed the findings . ' Piddle paddle , &quot; Fannin said . &quot; I have to tell you I disagree. &quot; The San Fernando Valley , hardest hit by the magnitude 6.8 quake , saw little change in its rate of disease , she said . Only 46 cases have been reported this year . The disease , a fungal_infection known to scientists as coccidioidomycosis , manifests no real symptoms in about 60 % of cases . Other victims experience flu-like exhaustion , coughing , even high fever and pneumonia . Older people are usually more severely affected . Fannin believes that Ventura County and the CDC overreacted to the valley_fever scare . &quot; They called everything with a positive lab test for antibodies a case of valley_fever , &quot; she said . She explained that tests would have been positive if a patient had contracted the illness any time in the last several years . Los Angeles County health officials do not count a case as valley_fever until further tests or active symptoms confirm the disease , Fannin said . CDC researchers defended their findings , saying all_of the Ventura County cases were confirmed with blood_tests . The direction of the wind or the amount of fungus found in the paved-over San Fernando Valley could account_for the low incidence there , said Eileen Schneider , a CDC epidemiologist in San Diego . Also , she said the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of the Valley did not experience the same landslide activity that occurred in the Santa Susana range near Simi Valley . Although the northern edge of the Valley also borders the Santa Susanas , winds were blowing toward Simi Valley after the quake , Schneider said . The quake and each of its aftershocks brought_up a cloud of ocher dust from the canyons around Simi Valley . The highest concentrations of valley_fever cases occurred in the neighborhoods near the base of the mountains north of the city , she said . A map hanging_in Ventura County ' s Public Health Services_Department shows graphically how valley_fever spores may have spread . Dozens of pushpins are clustered in Simi Valley . The pins fan_out on a southwest course , with several cases in Thousand Oaks , and thin_out farther from the mountains on the Oxnard Plain . Ventura County and CDC officials believed from the start that the earthquake had kicked_off the valley_fever outbreak , but conducted tests this spring aimed at proving their theory . They asked valley_fever victims if they had been in a dust_cloud , and more_than a third responded that they had . They tested a random_sample of the Simi Valley population for overall exposure to the fungus causing valley_fever and found fewer than 6 % had been exposed . They tracked the cases and found that the incidence of the disease returned to normal levels about two months after the quake . Finally , they studied the age , race and other demographic factors for victims and found nothing to suggest another reason for the outbreak , Schneider said . The disease takes it name from the San Joaquin Valley , where it is most commonly found .</TEXT>
