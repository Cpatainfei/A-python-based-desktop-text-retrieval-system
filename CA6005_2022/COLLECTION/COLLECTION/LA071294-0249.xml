   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER AT NUCLEAR LAB USED FOR ACCESS TO PORN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dramatically illustrating the security problems posed by the rapid_growth of the Internet computer_network , one of the nation ' s three nuclear_weapons labs confirmed Monday that computer hackers were using its computers to store and distribute hard-core pornography . Embarrassed officials at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , which conducts a great_deal of classified research and has highly sophisticated security procedures , said the incident was among the most serious breaches of computer security at the lab in Livermore , Calif . The computer , which was shut_down after a Times reporter investigating Internet hacking alerted lab officials , contained more_than 1 # 000 pornographic images . It was believed to be the largest illicit cache of hard-core pornography ever found on a computer_network . Computer hackers once were primarily mischief-makers aiming to prove their computer prowess , and they devoted their efforts to disrupting computer_systems at_large organizations or stealing technical information . But today , a new breed of hackers has developed methods for seizing partial control of Internet-linked computers and using them to store and distribute pornography , stolen computer software and other electronic information -- often for profit . The Internet , a &quot; network of networks &quot; originally designed to connect computers at universities and government research labs , has grown dramatically in size and technical sophistication in recent years . It is now used by many businesses and individual computer users , and is often viewed_as the prototype for the information superhighway of the future . But the Internet has an underside , where so-called &quot; pirates &quot; with code names such_as &quot; Mr. Smut , &quot; &quot; Acidflux &quot; and &quot; The Cowboy &quot; traffic in illegal or illegally obtained electronic information . The structure of the Internet means that such pirates can carry_out their crimes from almost anywhere in the world , and that tracing them is nearly impossible . The FBI late last week confirmed that it was investigating software piracy on the Internet . A Times reporter discovered a number of sites at prestigious institutions that were being used to distribute stolen software , including one in the office of the UC Berkeley chancellor and another at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . Pirate sites , which carry exotic monikers such_as &quot; 3 Days Till Death , &quot; &quot; Impact of Chaos &quot; and &quot; Field of Dreams , &quot; can generally be found only by highly sophisticated computer users who are well-schooled in the intricacies of the Internet . The pirates use a new and relatively obscure method for transferring information , known as the &quot; file service protocol , &quot; and they often change the location of their sites every few weeks to avoid detection . In April , MIT student David LaMaccia was arrested on felony conspiracy and wire fraud charges for allegedly using the protocols to distribute more_than $ 1 million worth of commercial software . The protocol allows files to be sent to large_numbers of computer users easily with minimal disruption of other computer functions . Pirates also have their own &quot; chat &quot; lines , a series of channels within a service_called the Internet Relay Chat . An elaborate pecking order determines who will be allowed to take_part in these conversations -- newcomers can often wangle their way in if they have a particularly hot piece of software to offer . Garden-variety copyrighted software is known as &quot; warez &quot; on these channels , while especially good software is called &quot; kewl , &quot; and brand-new software that has not even reached stores is called &quot; zero-day software. &quot; At the Lawrence Berkeley pirate site , the offerings last week included Power Japanese , which retails for $ 395 , as well as IBM DOS 6.3 and a game called Alien Legacy , which is not yet available in_stores . Sandy Merola , deputy director of information and computing at the Berkeley lab , said the pirate site was shut_down last week after The Times investigation revealed its existence . Merola said the Department_of_Energy , which oversees lab operations , as well as the FBI , had been notified of the incident . At Lawrence Livermore , officials said Monday they believe that at least one lab employee was involved in the pornography ring , along with an undetermined number of outside collaborators . Chuck Cole , deputy associate director of computing at the lab , said that nearly 2 # 000 megabytes of unauthorized graphic images have been found in a Livermore computer . He confirmed that they were pornographic . The employee has been placed on &quot; investigatory leave &quot; and his or her security badge confiscated while an investigation is under way , the lab said . It was unclear whether the pornographic images were being sold or how many people had gained access to them . The pictures were sufficiently graphic that they could be considered obscene by courts in some jurisdictions , in which case transmitting them over the Internet might be illegal . The massive amount of storage capacity used in the Livermore scheme shows how Internet hacking could be quite profitable . Seizing partial control of large and sophisticated computer_systems at universities or government laboratories can save unscrupulous entrepreneurs large sums_of_money . There were indications that the person operating the pornography database had become aware of possible scrutiny . On June 27 , a message left in a file labeled READ ME ! ! ! said : &quot; It appears that news about this site has escaped . In the past two weeks , I have had 27 unauthorized hosts attempt to access my server . This does not give me a warm-fuzzy feeling . I would hate to have to shut this down , but I may have no choice. &quot; One computer_expert , who requested anonymity , said there might be more to the incident than meets the eye . The expert suggested that the hard-core pornography may be a cover_for an ultra-sophisticated espionage program , in which a &quot; sniffer &quot; program combs through other Livermore computers , encodes the passwords and accounts it finds , and then hides them within the pornographic images , perhaps to be downloaded by foreign_agents . But Cole said there was no possibility of a computer intruder gaining access to classified data at Livermore Labs . &quot; We use an air gap security method in which no electronic connection of any kind is maintained between the classified computer world and the unclassified computer world. &quot; Cliff Stoll , a former computer_systems manager at Lawrence Berkeley who chronicled his experiences with a computer hacker in the book &quot; The Cuckoos Egg , &quot; said there would be easier ways to conduct espionage over the Internet than to use pornographic pictures as an encoding method . Still , the computer penetrations at Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley &quot; show very poor management on the part of the national labs , &quot; Stoll said . The problem of pirate sites extends far beyond U.S._government laboratories and universities : Many popular sites discovered by The Times are located in Mexico , France , Britain and other countries . One system operator of a pirate site in Istanbul , Turkey , openly bragged on-line that his country has no laws preventing the distribution of copyrighted software ; thus , he claimed , he was breaking no laws by doing so . The Software Publishers Assn. , a trade association representing major software manufacturers , has made software piracy on the Internet a major priority . Peter Beruk , the association ' s litigation manager , said : &quot; We are currently tracking over 1 # 600 pirate sites on the Internet in a joint investigation with the FBI . It is a very serious and costly problem . &quot; In the case of David LaMaccia , we estimate over a_million dollars of software was downloaded from his site in a two-week period . We will start going_after the universities next . . . . The Internet , in our view , is now getting a very bad name. &quot; Hal Hendershot , manager of the fraud and computer crime abuse initiative of the FBI , though declining to give any details , acknowledged that the bureau was cooperating with the association in_regard_to Internet piracy . As the popularity of the Internet surges , the problem of net piracy will increase , Hendershot said .</TEXT>
