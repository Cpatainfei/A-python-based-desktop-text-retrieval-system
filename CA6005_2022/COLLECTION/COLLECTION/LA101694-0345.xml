   <HEADLINE> KOHL ' S COALITION FAVORED AS GERMANS VOTE TODAY ; ELECTION : CHANCELLOR STANDS FOR PEACE AND STABILITY , HIS MAIN RIVAL SCHARPING FOR JOBS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Continuity or change . The old , post-World War II generation or the new ' 60s breed . Those are the options in the German federal election today , when voters must choose whether to return conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl to office for a fourth term or replace him with the younger Social Democrat , Rudolf Scharping . Kohl , 64 , who aspires to become Germany ' s longest-serving chancellor since the war , has barnstormed the country with such optimism that he already has journalists asking if he plans to run again in 1998 . Scharping , meanwhile , seeks to be the Bill_Clinton of Germany , a 46-year-old pragmatist leading his party back to power after 12 years in the back seat . Enough is enough , he says . It ' s time for a change . The Kohl camp is betting that , no matter how much Germany ' s 60 million voters might worry and complain , ultimately they will choose the status_quo . &quot; No German government ever has lost power in an election , &quot; a confident senior government official said . &quot; Never has a challenger replaced an incumbent through an open election. &quot; Most of the latest polls give a slight advantage to Kohl ' s three-party coalition , made_up of the Christian Democratic Union ; its Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union , and the liberal Free Democratic Party . But there are enough wild cards in the multi-party race that the weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel has prepared five possible cover stories for its Monday edition . And the weekly newspaper Die Woche asks_in a headline if there will be &quot; A Chancellor Change ? &quot; The yearlong campaign has been an American-style competition of personalities over issues : The veteran statesman Kohl versus the bearded Scharping , who quotes Dr. Martin_Luther_King Jr . Kohl stands_for peace and stability , Scharping for jobs and social justice . The business_community clearly prefers Kohl . And despite the prevailing issue of &quot; change , &quot; neither candidate has spoken_of making any radical changes in Germany ' s existing economic or foreign_policies , especially its relationship with the United States . Neither man , though , will have the votes to govern alone , and Germany ' s small parties ultimately will determine who rules a coalition government . With two ballots each to elect a Parliament , Germans vote for a deputy in their district and for a political_party . Elected deputies are guaranteed a seat if their party gets 5 % of the national vote ; the party list vote determines the overall percentage of seats each party gets . The chancellor is then picked in Parliament by the largest party or the party that can control the most seats in alliance with others . For decades , the kingmakers have been the Free Democrats . They helped bring Social Democratic Chancellor Willy Brandt to power in 1969 , and brought his party down again in 1982 when they switched sides to the Christian Democrats , putting Kohl in office . The liberals have vowed to go_with Kohl again , but they failed to win legislative seats in the last six state elections , raising questions about their viability in the federal vote . Can they scrape together the 5 % minimum needed to win seats in Parliament ? If the liberals fail to make the cut , or if the two parties together fall_short_of a clear majority , Kohl could be forced into a &quot; grand coalition &quot; with the Social Democrats . This option , last tried in the 1960s , is a last_resort for both sides . &quot; No one really wants it , &quot; said Stephan Kornelius , political reporter for the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung . &quot; A grand coalition increases the extreme parties on the left and right . In the middle_term , it will harm both of the big parties. &quot; The &quot; extreme &quot; vote is another uncertainty for Kohl , who ran a Cold_War , anti-Communist campaign . Although the ultra-rightist Republikaner Party almost certainly will not make_it into Parliament , the reformed Communist_Party of East_Germany , now called the Party of Democratic Socialism , has a shot under the leadership of its top candidate , Gregor Gysi , whom many consider to be Germany ' s most dynamic politician . Polls show that the PDS has less than 5 % support nationwide but strength in several eastern districts . Under a quirk in the election law , if it wins three districts it could take_up to 27 seats in the 656-seat Bundestag . The Social Democrats sought to form a government with the ecological Greens Party , which is expected to win its way back into the Bundestag today after losing out_in 1990 . The two parties alone are not likely to have enough votes to govern , and the question of whether they would ally_with the PDS became a campaign issue . Kohl hammered the Social Democrats for forming a state_government in Saxony-Anhalt earlier this year with the support of the former Communists . His attacks forced Scharping to say he would not turn_to the PDS to form a federal_government . The key may be in the question of change . At the beginning of the campaign season , more_than half of all voters said they wanted a change in government . Now , according to the pollsters at the Allensbach Institute , only 46 % say they do . And it takes more_than that to oust Kohl .</TEXT>
