   <HEADLINE> YEAR AFTER FAILED REVOLT , OUTLOOK BRIGHTER FOR YELTSIN ; RUSSIA : ECONOMIC INDICATORS ARE UP , BICKERING IS DOWN . BUT THE PRESIDENT MAY BE HIS OWN WORST ENEMY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A year ago , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin huddled inside the Kremlin trying to rouse his generals to quash an armed revolt by his Communist and nationalist foes . On Tuesday , a rosy-cheeked and triumphant Yeltsin spent the anniversary of last October ' s rebellion basking in the political calm that has settled over Moscow this fall . While several thousand demonstrators marched past the restored Russian White_House to mourn the 143 people killed in last year ' s strife and to denounce Yeltsin as a &quot; murderer &quot; and an &quot; alcoholic swine , &quot; most Muscovites ignored them . At a news_conference in the Kremlin , Yeltsin laid_out his plan for building &quot; a new Russia , a Russia without malice , bloodshed and deceit. &quot; The opposition , he said , is no longer dangerous . &quot; A second October_Revolution did not take_place , &quot; Yeltsin said . &quot; A catastrophe was prevented . This happened because Russians have learned to tell the truth from lies. &quot; Yeltsin had plenty to brag about after returning from a visit to the United States with $ 2 billion of trade and investment agreements , plus an agreement to speed_up the timetable for dismantling the Russian and American nuclear arsenals . A brace of positive economic statistics released Tuesday bolstered the president ' s case . Inflation rose to 7.7 % in September , up from 4 % in August but below the double-digit mark for the seventh consecutive month . In a sign that industrial production is stabilizing , output rose 2 % in August . The number of Russians living_in poverty fell slightly , from 20.5 % of the population last year to 18 % in 1994 , the Russian Labor Ministry announced . Poverty is defined as a monthly income of less than $ 23 . &quot; Household savings have begun to pick_up , &quot; Yeltsin said . &quot; The inflationary expectations of both consumers and producers have markedly declined . In other words , the first results ( of reform ) are already evident. &quot; Along with the improving economy , Yeltsin can also take cheer from a distinct drop_in the level of political bickering . When the Russian Parliament comes_back into session today , it is liable to cause Yeltsin fewer headaches than the U.S. Congress will give President Clinton . Yeltsin has promised to send 40 bills to Parliament , including a long-promised overhaul of Russia ' s wildly irrational tax code . He said the leaders of both houses of Parliament have already agreed to a new presidential decree that strengthens the president ' s control over Russia ' s unruly regions by allowing him to appoint key provincial leaders . With his enemies in retreat , the main threat to Yeltsin today may be Yeltsin himself . The Russian press has been having a field_day with Yeltsin for failing to get_out of his state airplane Friday for a scheduled meeting with the_Irish prime_minister at Ireland ' s Shannon Airport . And critics have once again begun sarcastic public discussions of the presidential drinking habits . Yeltsin said he simply overslept Friday and his security_guards refused to allow aides to wake him up in time for the meeting . The president said he slept little during the Washington summit and was tired after an 18-hour flight from Seattle . That explanation did not satisfy the Russian press , which noted that the flight from Seattle to western Ireland should not take more_than 12 hours . &quot; Where were they flying for 17 to 18 hours ? Were they flying via the South_Pole ? &quot; asked the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper . The newspaper Pravda called Yeltsin ' s explanation &quot; clumsy. &quot; Although the newspaper , which had been shut_down by the government last year for supporting the hard-line revolt , did not dare directly accuse the president of being too drunk to appear in public , it quoted the Times of London as saying that vodka might be to blame for &quot; the fiasco at Shannon. &quot;</TEXT>
