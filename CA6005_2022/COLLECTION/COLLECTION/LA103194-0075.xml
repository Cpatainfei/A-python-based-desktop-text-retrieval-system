   <HEADLINE> COMMITMENTS : SEEKING LOVE ' S FORTUNE ; IT WAS CURIOSITY REALLY , BUT MAYBE A PSYCHIC WOULD KNOW . HAD SHE MARRIED THE RIGHTMAN ? AFTER FOUR READINGS , SHE KNEW SHE HAD THE ANSWER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Our marriage enjoys the tranquillity of a peacetime truce . Generally , we have agreed to friendly nation status . But border skirmishes do arise from time to time , followed by sanctions , otherwise known as the silent_treatment . This lasts until one of us decides to wave the white_flag and the peace_treaty is again signed , honored and revered . Joy and all that other Cinderella hullabaloo enters into our marriage only as a byproduct of respect and compromise . War metaphors and fairy tales notwithstanding , we have had the good_fortune of happiness . So why screw it up with crystal balls , hazy auras and Tarot cards ? Because curiosity gotthe best of me . If I had done the right thing by getting_married to this man , then a psychic was sure to know . But if , on the other hand , I had made a mistake , I felt it my responsibility to find_out . I searched through the Yellow Pages under &quot; Psychic &quot; but was referred to &quot; Spiritual Consultants. &quot; Of course ! What was I thinking ? There were several to choose from : &quot; European Master Clairvoyant , &quot; &quot; Egyptian Psychic , &quot; &quot; America ' s Native Psychic. &quot; One of the ads offered house calls . Another , inexplicably , pictured a Star_of_David superimposed over a menorah . Most showed crystal balls and beautiful women adorned in hoop earrings and scarves . I chose a psychic who promised to answer all my love questions . She was in Beverly Hills , which seemed an appropriate place to start since this region of Planet Los Angeles has always subscribed_to its own cosmic set of rules . My psychic greeted me at the door of her tiny apartment with a portable phone stuck_to her ear and gruffly motioned for me to sit_down at the kitchen_table . Then she left me there for several minutes while she whispered hotly into the phone in the adjacent room . Urgent matters concerning past lives , no doubt . When she returned , she sat_down and instructed me to shuffle the deck of Tarot cards while I concentrated_on my deepest desires and my most hidden fears . Ice_cream , ice_cream , ice_cream , I thought . In a town where no one goes five feet without a cellular_phone and Hollywood deals are made_over plates of pasta , I was surprised that there was to be no schmoozing with my psychic . She plunged into the reading with nary a preamble , flipping cards with maddening haste while she predicted what fortunes would enter my life . She quickly dispensed_with the standard predictions : I ' ll be rich , I ' ll sign an important document , I ' ll travel somewhere exotic . But essentially , I was going_to be meeting dozens of men : men from my past , men at weddings , older_men with lots of money . Even a dead man who served as my spirit guide , although I would never really know his true identity . The only mention of a woman had to do with a red-haired friend who would betray me . So_much for sisterhood . I didn ' t want to say anything to her , but this hardly resembled my life . Basically , I know four men : my husband , my dad and my two bothers . When I have free_time , I spend it with my girlfriends . As for some wizened old dead guy as my protector , I have to confess that when I believe_in it , I tend to lean toward angels as my guardians . When she had finished with the reading , the psychic told me to pick three cards and ask a question . &quot; What about my marriage ? &quot; I demanded . &quot; Oh , &quot; she said . She seemed surprised -- hardly_a response I would have expected from a psychic . &quot; You ' re married ? &quot; &quot; Three years , &quot; I said . Her response was emphatic , sudden , slightly embarrassed . &quot; I see a separation , &quot; she said . Then she looked_at her watch . &quot; Anything else ? &quot; I shook my head no . &quot; That ' ll be $ 35 , &quot; she said and showed me to the door . For a moment I stood outside in front of the glitzy storefronts of Beverly Hills , feeling much like Dorothy must have felt during those first few seconds in Oz . How did I get here ? My psychic couldn ' t have been further from the truth regarding my life , although I have to admit to enjoying that fleeting fantasy of all those future men . If anything , she was adept at fostering hope -- for single women perhaps -- but it didn ' t apply to me . I decided to go_for a second opinion . As I drove aimlessly through the urban madness of the Fairfax District , I stumbled onto my second psychic . I was drawn to the mixed metaphors displayed proudly in her gallery window . A Sphinx , a Merlin doll , a crystal ball . From behind a curtain , which presumably led to her living quarters , I heard an &quot; I Love Lucy &quot; rerun blaring from a television_set and the voices of small children . My psychic greeted me cheerfully in the gallery while her two kids ran_out into the street , tore_down the Merlin doll , grabbed for my keys and began to cry hysterically . She apologized and took_hold_of my hands while a man came from behind the curtain and retrieved the little brats . Like the first one , this psychic mentioned that I would soon be signing an important paper , that I would get rich_in the near future and that I should expect to travel somewhere distant . But she was more specific : I ' d be going_to Spain , China or Washington , D.C. Then she got right down to the nitty gritty . &quot; Your aura is filthy , &quot; she informed me . &quot; You ' re surrounded by negativity. &quot; I was shocked . This was like going_to the mechanic for a broken radiator_hose and finding_out you need a new transmission . &quot; But I wanted to find_out about my relationship , &quot; I said . &quot; Oh , don ' t worry about that , &quot; she said . &quot; You guys are made_for each other. &quot; She then closed her eyes and squeezed my hands . &quot; I could get_to the bottom of your negativity . Your aura is real pale. &quot; &quot; But what about my husband ? Did I marry the right guy ? &quot; &quot; You guys are soul_mates , I tell you , &quot; she said . She seemed a little irritated , as if she were tired_of stating the obvious . &quot; But , listen , I could clear_up that negativity for an additional $ 70. &quot; * Ideclined the offer and high-tailed it out of there . Something wasn ' t right . They both said the same things about money , travel and my signature . But in matters concerning love , they were diametrically opposed . Maybe I had just turned_to the wrong psychics . Maybe Venice Beach , land of the inscrutable , home of the slightly sleazy , gallery of life ' s shady underbelly was where the more practiced seers dwell . They seemed to congregate there at any rate . As I sauntered down the boardwalk , dodging big dogs and kamikaze skateboarders sporting Nazi tattoos , I stumbled onto a kindly psychic who greeted me with an almost toothless smile and warm blue eyes . &quot; You married your best_friend , &quot; she said . I fell_into her smooth voice like I would a feather_bed . &quot; He loves you very , very much . He has a big heart . But you two have a long , rocky road ahead of you . This is because of your past life . See this ? &quot; she said . She pointed to one of the cards , a picture of a cup with conical shapes , like icicles falling_into it . She nodded knowingly . &quot; Uh huh , &quot; she said , as if I had given any indication at all that I ' d derived meaning from the card . Then she proceeded to ask me some embarrassing personal details involving our sex life , which for some reason I felt obliged to answer . My answers seemed to surprise her , given the fact that my &quot; lower chakras weren ' t in order. &quot; I was too afraid to ask her what a chakra was . It all sounded vaguely unsavory , even though I later learned they had to do with &quot; energy centers. &quot; It was precisely these chakras that stood_in the way of total happiness for me and my husband . And for a small fee , she could clear_up the problem . When I declined , she lost interest in me . I paid her the basic rate of $ 15 and left . * By now , I realized that I was no closer to the answer than when I had started , even though I had unwittingly uncovered several problems related to my various energy centers , all_of which , miraculously , could be cleared_up for a &quot; small additional fee. &quot; Any sane person might have stopped right there and done something more conventional like go_to Palm Desert and uncover the truth in a honeymoon suite . But no one has ever accused me of being sane . In a desperate move I made one last attempt to discover whether or not , according to the mystical world of stars , planets and Tarot cards , I had married the right guy . The minute I got home , I dialed a 900 number where for $ 2.99 a minute I was guaranteed my own &quot; spiritual consultant. &quot; From the outset , she told me that we were_on a 12-minute timer and if we were disconnected , I shouldn ' t take it personally . I told her I could handle that . While the psychic computer ran my and my husband ' s compatibility chart in the background , using the extremely scientific data of our birth dates , places_of_birth and how late we would sleep if we didn ' t have to work , my psychic warned me that I should make extra allowances for my relationship next month . &quot; You know that Mars is in Cancer next month , right ? &quot; she asked worriedly . As if this meant anything to me . She then continued by telling me that even though the stars showed a marital breakup , I ' d nevertheless have a marriage of permanency . Huh ? After a six-month long-range forecast in which , among other things ( and not surprisingly ) , I would make a lot of money , sign an important document and travel someplace far away , my psychic informed me that the computer had finished the compatibility chart . &quot; OK , dear . Your compatibility chart says . . . . &quot; Click . The phone went dead . For a wild moment I contemplated calling_back . But then it occurred to me that I ' d reached the end of the road as far as my astral travels were concerned . I had just completed four sessions with four psychics in which I discovered only one truth : There was no truth unless I needed to believe_in one . But the fact is , when all was said and done , all I ever needed to do was ask myself three questions : Who is my best_friend , whom do I trust most in the world and , above all else , who would I share my winning Lotto ticket with ? I didn ' t need a psychic to tell me the answer is my husband . For us , an occasional border skirmish is never really a serious threat , especially since he and I have always loved a good peace_treaty .</TEXT>
