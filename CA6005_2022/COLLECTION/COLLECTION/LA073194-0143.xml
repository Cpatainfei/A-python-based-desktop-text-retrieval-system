   <TEXT> The peasant woman and her children barely looked_up from reaping wheat when a fleet of limousines roared by , full of dignitaries who had just pushed the world trading system into the 21st Century . Morocco ' s leaders want to take their ancient kingdom there too , but will have to make radical changes first . King Hassan II and his band of technocrats are trying to make a free-market model for the Third_World , rapidly shaping an export-driven economy that will , they hope , become to Europe what Mexico has been to the United States . But the impressive strides made in textiles , electronics assembly and agriculture coexist with poverty , illiteracy , corruption and enduring , if declining , human-rights abuses . &quot; Morocco dreams of being a new dragon , &quot; said Abdelaziz Benani , vice_president of the Moroccan Human_Rights Organization . &quot; Well , to be a new dragon , you can ' t be illiterate . You can ' t wait for people to have decent lives to give them political freedom. &quot; Political reforms are coming_to Morocco more slowly than economic change . International pressure on Hassan to loosen his authoritarian rule eased quickly after Islamic fundamentalists began an insurgency in neighboring Algeria in 1992 . In response to modest democratic reforms in the last two years , the United States and Europe now portray Morocco as an island of stability in an uncertain region . The seal_of_approval was the April conference of delegates from 120 nations who signed a trade treaty in Marrakech , an oasis city refurbished for the occasion with road repairs and new paint . Officials of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade described Morocco as an economic succcess story worthy of emulation . Human_rights groups say the government lured hundreds of unemployed people off the streets of Marrakech before the conference with promises of work , then sent them to a military camp . Police officials confirmed that about 3 # 000 people considered undesirable were cleared_out of the city . Unlike most other African_countries , Morocco strictly followed World_Bank directives over the last decade , slashing spending and the national_debt . The currency is convertible and 112 state-owned companies are being sold to private investors . Like Mexico , Morocco has become a low-income manufacturing center for a richer neighbor , in this case the European Union , which grants preferential import_duties . Eventually , Morocco wants to become an EU member . Wealth is unevenly distributed in Hassan ' s kingdom . Industrial workers earn the equivalent of 75 cents an hour and peasants lead a hand-to-mouth existence little changed since the Middle_Ages . The rural poor migrate to cities in search of work . Morocco ' s economy cannot generate enough jobs for its 26 million people , three-quarters of whom are under 35 . Half of the men cannot read or write . Illiteracy among women is 68 % nationally , 90 % in the countryside . Desperate people seek to emigrate to Europe , which is closing the doors to deal with its own high unemployment . Some people have drowned in boats that sank trying to cross the Strait_of_Gibraltar to Spain . Officials are occasionally arrested for selling visas . Ordinary people complain of police brutality and official corruption , but are careful not to criticize the king . That can bring a long prison_term . An oft-recounted illustration is the fund raising for the world ' s largest mosque in Casablanca , named for the king and opened last year . Hassan asked his subjects_to donate what they could . Most interpreted that to mean a_few dirhams , worth about 10 cents each . Widely circulated stories have it , however , that officials at every level took their cut and local police shook people down for arbitrary sums , threatening them with jail if they refused to pay . Authorities deny the allegations . &quot; Foreigners think Morocco is the desert , but it ' s more like the sea -- the big fish eat the little fish , &quot; said a Marrakech man who would not give his name for fear of retaliation . The sea is becoming a little safer , at least for recognizable fish . Hassan named a deputy minister for human_rights in 1993 and some well-known political_prisoners have been freed . But last year ' s U.S. State_Department human_rights report cites evidence that three prisoners died of police torture , and human_rights groups say dozens of people have &quot; disappeared &quot; in the last 20 years while in custody .</TEXT>
