   <HEADLINE> ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH : EXECUTIVE TRAVEL : SPOTLIGHT ON HONG KONG ; A WESTERN CITY-STATE IN THE HEART OF ASIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For business_travelers , Hong Kong is both exotic and familiar . The British crown colony , which will revert to Chinese rule_in 1997 , is both an ultramodern center of commerce with an exploding economy and a traditional Asian_country with Old_World ways . The good news for travelers is that despite the dense population , it is fairly easy to travel and do business in Hong Kong , which is the capital city of the colony . &quot; It ' s a fun city to be in , &quot; said Dwynn Helms , a House of Fabrics buyer in Los Angeles who travels_to Hong Kong about twice a year . With stores and showrooms open late and sometimes on weekends , &quot; you can do business seven days a week if you want to. &quot; Entry requirements : To travel_to Hong Kong , you need a passport and proof of return or onward transportation , but you don ' t need a visa for stays of 30 days or less . For more information , contact the_British Consulate in Los Angeles at ( 310 ) 477-3322 . Getting there : Kai Tak Airport , which is_on the Kowloon side of the harbor across from Hong Kong Island , is about 20 minutes from the city of Kowloon and 40 minutes from hotels across the harbor . Clean and fast buses that leave every 15 minutes will get you from the airport to your hotel . Or you can take a cab , which will be more expensive . Cab_fare to the Hong Kong side runs about $ 10 ; the shuttle costs between $ 2 and $ 3 , said Winchell Cheung , marketing officer for the Hong Kong Trade and Development Council in Los Angeles . Getting_around : Most travelers find they don ' t need to rent a car in Hong Kong because it is a small area with a well-developed public transportation_system . &quot; Besides , traffic can be a problem , &quot; said Albert Chen , general_manager of Irvine-based Potrans , who travels frequently in Asia . One of the easiest ways to get_around is underground . &quot; The subway system is very sophisticated , convenient and inexpensive , &quot; Chen said . &quot; There ' s no graffiti and no litter , &quot; Helms said . &quot; You can buy a multi-ride pass and get almost anywhere you need to go , including outlying areas. &quot; It is also easy to catch a minibus , which seats 10 to 15 people and will stop anywhere you want along its route , Chen said . Taxis are also plentiful and not terribly expensive , because most Hong Kong destinations are close_together , he said . Language : In Hong Kong and Kowloon , English is usually spoken in hotels , Helms said . In the more outlying areas , English becomes less common . If you are traveling_to a distant location by subway and will need to get a bus or taxi to your final destination , get instructions written in Chinese to present to the driver before you leave , Helms said . The concierges at most business-class hotels will be able to assist with directions . Also , before you leave , be able to recognize the name of your destination and the stop where you will get_off . Although many people speak English , most signs are not in English , she said . Tipping : As in many Pacific Rim countries , tipping is not expected in restaurants and cabs , but it is appreciated , Chen said . Money : You can exchange U.S. dollars for Hong Kong dollars at hotels and private money_changers , but banks will provide the best rate . Hotels are convenient , even if the rates are not as good . Always ask about fees in addition to the exchange_rate . And be wary of private exchange booths along the roadway , especially if they advertise low fees , because they often make_up for it with poor_rates , Chen said . Although traveler ' s checks are accepted in many places , using them to make purchases will end_up costing you more because of poor exchange_rates . It ' s better to change them into local currency first . Safety : As in any dense metropolitan area , you need to be cautious . Because Hong Kong has so many tourists , police and security officers patrol the streets quite heavily , Chen said : &quot; They want people to feel safe. &quot; According to the U.S. State_Department Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington , serious crime is not a problem for most travelers in Hong Kong , but pickpocketing is fairly common . If your passport is lost or stolen , make_sure you report it to both the local police and the U.S. Consulate . If you register at the American Consulate General ( 26 Garden Road in Hong Kong , ( 852 ) 523-9011 ) , you will be able to get continuously updated information on security conditions . For safety information before you go , call the Bureau of Consular Affairs ' automated travel information line at ( 202 ) 647-5225 . Business hours : Hong Kong business days start later than those in the United States , Chen said . Most business people don ' t start their day until 9:30 or 10 a.m. Lunch is between noon and 1 p.m. Hotels : Always have a reservation , because hotels fill_up quickly . For help with reservations or to check vacancies , contact the Hong Kong Hotel Assn. , found at airport counters . Many of the major Western chains , including Holiday Inn , Ramada , Sheraton , Hilton , Hyatt , Marriott and Radisson , have hotels in either Kowloon or Hong Kong .</TEXT>
