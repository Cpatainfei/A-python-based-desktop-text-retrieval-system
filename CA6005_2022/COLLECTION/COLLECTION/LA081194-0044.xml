   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : FRUITFUL &amp; MULTIPLYING ; OFFICIALS SAY THE STATE ' S BEAR POPULATION IS THE LARGEST IN 10 YEARS . THE REASON ? POACHING IS DOWN AND VENTURA COUNTY ' S AVOCADO ORCHARDS ARE RIPE FOR THE PICKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Game_warden John Castro was disgusted when he stepped into a bog at the lower Lion Campground in late June and found the decaying carcass of a female bear shot by poachers . The gall bladder had been removed . So had the teeth and claws . &quot; The canines looked_like they had been snapped_off , &quot; Castro said . &quot; It was pretty grizzly. &quot; A gallbladder can easily fetch $ 50 # 000 in Asia where apothecaries use them to treat human stomach ailments and blood_diseases . Teeth and claws are routinely used in jewelry . A Newbury Park man has been charged in the crime that stands_out not only for its wantonness -- a 250-pound animal was killed for less than two pounds of parts -- but also for its rarity . Officials maintain that poaching has declined sharply and they cite that as one reason the state ' s bear population is the largest it ' s been in 10 years , maybe the largest ever . Officials estimate that as_many as 24 # 000 California black_bears inhabit the state , a growing number of them in counties like Ventura , which has lots of bears . Big bears . The largest black_bear killed in North_America was shot in the western tributaries of Piru Creek . The year was 1990 . &quot; He was big enough to cover a 4-by-8 piece of plywood , &quot; said Loren Nodolf , an offshore oil worker , who shot the record bear during the fall hunting_season . &quot; He must have had six inches of fat on him . We estimated he weighed 800 pounds. &quot; Weight doesn ' t count in record books . Trophy bears are measured by the length and width of their craniums , and in addition to Nodolf ' s record bear , two other county bears had skulls big enough to be listed in Boone and Crockett Big Game Awards , the book of record for North_American game trophies . GUACAMOLE The individual size and overall numbers of bears is_due , at least in part , to the 82 # 600 tons of avocados the county produced last year . Biologists report that bears are gorging themselves to obese dimensions on the calorie-rich fruit and reproducing with abandon . &quot; Yep , there are some exceptionally large bears_up there with nice shiny coats , &quot; said Morgan Boucke , a local wildlife biologist for the California Department of Fish and Game . When high daytime temperatures cause avocados in Ojai and Fillmore to fall from the trees , bears from the surrounding Los Padres National Forest amble into orchards at night . By morning , their muzzles appear to be covered with guacamole . Ernie Acosta , a game_warden in Ventura County for 11 years , said irrigated orchards provide bears with a stable water_supply and because the trees are pollinated by bees , a hungry bear can , after enjoying an avocado entree , take_down an apiary for dessert . In bear-think , orchards are like fast-food drive-throughs . Bob Considine is one avocado rancher who doesn ' t much mind the intrusions . The Ojai grower has 20 acres of avocados surrounded on two sides by the national forest . Considine said that between 2 % and 5 % of the fruit normally falls from the tree before it can be harvested , making_it unmarketable . That amounts to as much as 10 # 000 pounds in his grove alone . &quot; We try not to bother the bears , &quot; Considine said . &quot; Lots of ranchers get upset about it , but the loss to me is not more_than I would normally have from seasonal drop . We kind of like the idea of having them in the grove. &quot; Ojai grower Roger Essick is another grower who gets_along fine with his nocturnal visitors . &quot; We ' re right against the national forest , &quot; Essick said . &quot; They don ' t know where the boundary is , so they have a right to hang_around . They ' ve broken a_few branches over the years , but it ' s not a problem . We ' re kind of happy to have them. &quot; Not all ranchers are such gracious hosts . Fish and Game issued five depredation permits last year in Ventura County , which allow people to shoot a bear that ' s damaging property . None of the ranchers was able to get the larcenous bears in their gun sights . The fall hunting_season is a different story . Each year an average of eight bears are killed -- hunters prefer the euphemism &quot; harvested &quot; -- in Ventura County , and more_than 1 # 000 bears are taken throughout the state during the season , which runs from October to December . Simon Oswitch , vice_president of Animal Emancipation , a Ventura animal rights group , sees it as a harvest of shame . &quot; We feel that it ' s an anachronistic blood sport completely out_of_place in a society that ' s already so violent that people are afraid to go_out at night , &quot; Oswitch said . Ironically , Oswitch is the sort of person Marsha Vaughan is afraid of . Vaughan may be North_America ' s foremost woman bear hunter . She ' s too modest to claim the title , but the bear she killed in 1990 above her Ojai home ranked 14th , the highest ranking for a woman hunter . Fearing reprisals from animal rights activists , she declined to be photographed with her bear , which is displayed in her living room , frozen in mid step as if stalking the television . The animal was so big , taxidermists had to use a grizzly_bear mount , she said . The same was true of Nodolf ' s bear , which is in a Wyoming museum . Despite an average_cost of $ 3 # 500 for a full body mount , preserving trophies is something of a passion . Nodolf keeps the record skull in his basement along with another osteal trophy -- a baculum , the long , slender bone most carnivores have in their penis . It ' s a collectible among bear hunters , some of whom have the baculum silver-plated and use it as a swizzle_stick to stir their cocktails . Animal right activists are stirred also . &quot; As far as I am concerned , it ' s not only a question of whether killing harms the population , &quot; said Michael Markarian , campaign coordinator for the New York-based Fund for Animals . &quot; Hunters are harming each individual bear . We ' re concerned about the pain each bear endures from recreational hunters. &quot; NUMBERS Mike Vaughan , husband and hunting guide for Marsha Vaughn , says people like Markarian rely_on emotions rather than science . He calls them &quot; nature fakers. &quot; He counters that starvation and territorial battles among males , both results of overpopulation , aren ' t very pleasant for the individual bear either . &quot; We have more bears now than 10 years ago . Definitely , &quot; Vaughan said . &quot; When I first started walking these hills with my dad , all you ' d see were tracks and scat . I can go_out now and see three or four bears in daylight. &quot; Anecdotal reports like Vaughan ' s are part of the reason the Department of Fish and Game decided to commission a study on the distribution of bear populations in several coastal counties from Los Angeles to Santa Cruz . Sandy Schultz , a researcher for the department , had volunteers place bait along 150 miles of trails and fire roads in the Ventura County backcountry . They were instructed to check the bait seven days later for signs of bear . Volunteers made note of the type of terrain and vegetation to determine what areas bears favor . Mike Vaughan was one of the volunteers . He set_out a bait line of canned sardines along the Gridley Trail above Ojai . After punching holes in the can and spilling the oil to attract the attention of bears , Vaughan fastened the can to a tree with a wire durable enough to keep animals such_as coyotes from disturbing it . &quot; If a bear hits this , you ' ll know it . They can destroy a rolled steel can as easy as an NFL lineman can shred an aluminum beer can. &quot; And hit the bait they did . Preliminary results showed that of all_the counties surveyed , Ventura had the highest percentage of bear visitations . That doesn ' t tell Schultz how many bears are out there , but given what she estimates is the amount of land necessary to support a bear -- and that ' s not accounting_for artificial food sources like avocados , which dramatically increase the amount of forage available -- there are_well over 100 of them in the county . SUCCESS STORY Whatever their numbers , the success of Euarctos_americanus has been remarkable , especially in Southern California . As recently as the 1930s there were virtually no black_bears in the southern portion of the state . But because their only natural predator , the grizzly or brown_bear , has been extinct in California since 1922 , the highly adaptive black_bear has been free to expand its habitat , said Doug Updike , a bear researcher with Fish and Game . Colonization started in 1933 when park rangers banished 27 troublesome black_bears from Yosemite_National_Park to the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains . Since then they ' ve spread to the extent that one biologist includes them with coyotes as one of the few examples of a large mammal that ' s thriving despite the impacts of civilization . Habitat is an important part of the equation . Whereas grizzlies preferred lightly forested foothills and grasslands -- the landscape favored for development -- black_bears like mountainous terrain where nary a strip mall intrudes . The other big reason for the black_bear ' s success is a decrease in poaching , officials said . But recent arrests may point to an upswing in multimillion-dollar trade_in bear parts , especially gallbladders . A Hollywood businessman was fined $ 10 # 000 after prosecutors charged him in January with running an illegal hunting club to collect and sell the bear gallbladders , which they said could have been worth up_to $ 600 # 000 . Then in late June a Rosemead man was arrested , culminating an 18-month investigation stretching across four states , after he allegedly bought 160 gallbladders from undercover_agents . Lt . Ed Watkins of the Fish and Game special operations unit said it ' s the largest case he ' s seen during his nine-year career . All of this makes warden John Castro ' s discovery of the poached female at Lion ' s campground more disturbing , but Fish and Game officials are confident they have the_matter in_hand . &quot; The data strongly suggests that poaching is not a significant factor , &quot; Updike said . &quot; The biggest issue is the habitat one . As long as habitat is preserved , our model for the next 10 years shows the population bouncing along with the carrying capacity of the environment. &quot; that ' s just fine with Nodolf , who ' s out there looking_for an even bigger bear than his 1990 record . &quot; I ' ve seen tracks as big or bigger than the one I shot . My bear was only an 8-year-old . His dad might still be out there. &quot; The American_Black_Bear Size : 4.5 to 6 feet long and 2 to 3 feet high at the shoulders . Weight : 200 to 400 pounds for adults . Coloring : Black to cinnamon brown , usually with a patch of white on chest . Face is always brown . Range : In California , pine and hardwood forests and chaparral . Food : Fruits , berries , acorns , grasses , roots , small mammals such_as rodents , carrion , insects and even garbage . Habits : Solitary and territorial , with a shuffling walk and a stride about a foot long . Adult_males occupy areas of about 20 square_miles and often kill_off young males that approach on their territory . Females mate in mid-July every_other year and give_birth to one or two cubs at a time . If forage conditions are poor , the bears cannot reproduce for a year . Hibernation : Hibernates from mid-winter to early spring . Sources : California Department of Fish and Game ; Fish and Game biologists ; &quot; Harper &amp; Row ' s Complete Field Guide to North_American Wildlife , Western Edition &quot; ; &quot; Western Forests , &quot; by Stephen Whitney . Tips for Keeping Nature ' s ' Eating Machines ' at_Bay Normally docile and easily frightened , black_bears are becoming more aggressive in competing for food and territory , biologists said . You don ' t have to cancel your weekend hike in the backcountry , but if you ' re frying a pan of bacon in a bear ' s living room , be prepared_for some uninvited ursine attention . Conflicts usually peak from July through October , when bears are prone to eat just about anything to put_on fat for the winter , said Glenn Stewart , a Cal Poly Pomona zoology professor who tracked Southern California bears from 1970 through 1990 . He said that during the summer , bears consume something like 20 # 000 calories a day . They are omnivorous eating machines , devouring grass , berries , acorns , avocados and the occasional picnic basket . &quot; They know what an ice_chest looks_like and they ' ll go right to it , &quot; said Morgan Boucke , a wildlife biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game in Ventura . John Boggs , a recreation assistant at U.S. Forest Service ' s Ojai Ranger Station , said most contacts are in the Rose Valley and along Sespe Creek . Campers frying bacon at the Lion Campground , a mile east of Rose Valley at Sespe Creek , have had to chase off the bears . Boucke said a_few tips can prevent an unpleasant bear encounter . * Don ' t make yourself smell too good . &quot; Walking_around bear country wearing suntan lotion that smells like a pina colada is probably not a good idea , &quot; she said . * Do not cook and sleep_in the same area . Do the cooking as much as 300 yards away . * Learn to identify tracks and scat . If you see a lot of either , that ' s probably a bad place to cook dinner . * Always hang your food at least 10 feet off the ground and 10 feet away from the trunk of the tree . A rope strung between two trees works well . * If you see a bear_on the trail , don ' t run_away . Wave your arms and make_noise . It helps to carry some stones in your pocket to throw at the bear . Stewart said young bears that are separating from their mothers and trying to find homes of_their_own are the ones most likely to come_in contact with people . It was a young , 200-pound bear that mauled an Ojai boy last August as he slept at a camp at Barton Flats in the San Bernardino Mountains . &quot; Last year , with the bear incident , people were worried about them , so we had more bear reports , &quot; Boucke said .</TEXT>
