   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : SANTA ANA ; DREAM TRIP TO JAPAN COMES TRUE FOR PUPIL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fernando Avila could write a book about how badly he wants to visit Japan , but after penning an award-winning essay , he doesn ' t have to . Fernando , a student at Willard Intermediate School , recently won first prize in a national essay contest , earning a trip to Japan . The 12-year-old is one of six students nationwide who won all-expenses paid , 13-day trips that include a trip to Tokyo , rides_on a bullet train , a visit to a Kabuki theater performance and a stay with a Japanese family . Fernando , who left for Japan on Sunday , said in an interview Friday that the trip is &quot; the best thing that ever happened to me. &quot; The youngster won by writing one of the winning 300-word essays answering the question , &quot; Why should I be chosen to go_on the trip ? &quot; in a contest for students sponsored by TDK Corp . Fernando ' s essay covered Japanese culture , customs and technology . &quot; Not a lot of kids get this opportunity . But if you really work for it , you can accomplish almost anything , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s what I thought when I won. &quot; Fernando didn ' t win the trip without help . Because student contest winners need chaperons , their teachers had to write essays answering why they should be allowed to accompany them and describe what makes their students especially deserving of the trip . The winners were chosen as a team , said Teresa Gertsman , Fernando ' s teacher and new traveling companion . Gertsman , 29 , said she was ecstatic to learn she would accompany her student , whose curiosity and motivation featured prominently in her own essay . &quot; One of my biggest points was how tenacious he is . He was so interested in the contest that he had his essay done two weeks before the deadline , and I hadn ' t even written mine yet . Every day he was asking me , ' Have you written your essay ? Have you written your essay ? ' Plus , he ' s really , really bright , &quot; she said . Fernando said he looked_forward to representing the United States and learning about a culture he finds fascinating . Plus , he said , trips like this one are important in fostering cooperation between different societies . &quot; I think it ' s really important to get an idea of how people are in other countries and what do they do , so we can know each other and better understand each other , &quot; he said .
