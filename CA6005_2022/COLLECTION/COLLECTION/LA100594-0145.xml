   <HEADLINE> DIALING UP A WEAPON AGAINST MOLESTATION ; AGENCIES : BY NEXT SUMMER , CALIFORNIANS WILL HAVE A HOT_LINE TO IDENTIFY CONVICTED SEX OFFENDERS . BUT IS IT FAIR ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Its critics dismiss it as a hot_line for hysteria . Its champions say it will succeed where law_enforcement has failed in protecting vulnerable children from pedophiles . A new law that establishes the seven-digit 900 telephone_number , as yet to be determined , is the most talked-about part of California ' s reaction to the national alarm over child_molesters . The politically popular measure , which Gov . Pete Wilson signed into law last week , will enable Californians by next summer to call the number and learn whether someone -- a neighbor , an employee , a youth leader or a boyfriend -- has been convicted of felony child molestation . They will also have access at their local police_station to photographs and ZIP_codes of thousands of the most violent and habitual convicted molesters . &quot; I think the bill sends a message to the offender , &quot; said Assemblywoman Barbara Alby ( R-Fair Oaks ) , who sponsored the bill . &quot; You ' ve been living_in anonymity and no one knows you ' re there . By golly , now you start acting funny around kids , someone might call_up about you. &quot; Or they might take more extreme measures . Residents of other parts of the country have used such information to run pedophiles out of town . In Washington state , which allows police to notify a community when a sex offender has settled there , the home of a convicted child rapist was burned_down the day he was scheduled to move_in . In Detroit , neighbors reportedly flooded the apartment unit of a rumored child_molester and tacked up signs saying &quot; Child_Molester Two Doors Down. &quot; Likewise in Louisiana , which requires just-released child_molesters to notify their neighbors when they move_in , signs went_up naming the offender . &quot; If you talk to victim ' s parents , they all say , ' If I had only known he was a sex offender , I would have never allowed my kid to be around him , ' &quot; Louisiana Assistant Atty . Gen . Greg Murphy said in support of notification laws . &quot; Some are married with kids and have families , &quot; Murphy said . &quot; One guy was a pillar of the community . He went_to church every single day . He had been molesting kids for 30 years . . . . They have to gain your trust or they won ' t be able to be alone with your child. &quot; California this year has sent a raft of messages to sex offenders . One new law requires them to verify their addresses every year ; currently many move and do not re-register . Another establishes a special unit in the Department_of_Justice to monitor the whereabouts of child_molesters and to perform undercover_work to break_up child sex rings operating through magazines and computers . Another requires registration for convicts who would otherwise have fallen_through the cracks -- those whose sex-related offenses were dropped during plea bargains . In addition , a &quot; one-strike &quot; law could earn violent first-time child_molesters sentences of 25 years to life . * The crackdown reflects public anguish and frustration over several brutal and tragic killings of children by parolees in recent months . Entire communities rallied for reform after the deaths of Polly Klaas , 12 , who was kidnaped last year from her Petaluma bedroom , and Megan Kanka , 7 , allegedly lured this summer into the New Jersey home of a neighbor . The neighbor , a convicted sex offender , was charged in Megan ' s death . Another victim , Ashley Estell , 7 , was abducted last year from a Texas park during a soccer game ; a man on parole for a sex offense was convicted of her murder last week and sentenced to death . In the course of that investigation , police learned that another sex offender had been scheduled to work as a soccer official for the same tournament . &quot; We know pedophiles take jobs at fast-food places , toy stores , volunteer and charity organizations that deal with_children . Women who are divorced marry men , unaware they are pedophiles who have gone_on to molest their children , &quot; said Jack Stevens , a California assistant attorney_general whose office initiated the telephone measure . &quot; If these people are not in prison , the only thing you can do is keep them from having access to children , &quot; said Stevens , who places little value on treatment programs . There are 65 # 000 convicted and released sex offenders in California , of whom about 40 # 000 were convicted of sex crimes against children , according to the state_Department of Justice . Most have received little or no treatment . In California and 38 other states , felony offenders must register with their local law_enforcement agencies upon release . Even if offenders continue to provide their current addresses over time -- and in one study , three-quarters did not -- Stevens said law_enforcement officials are permitted to use the list only to find suspects after a crime . With the new telephone_number operated by the Department_of_Justice , anyone can call and ask if an individual has been convicted of a sex offense . The caller will need to provide the person ' s name and either date of birth , Social_Security_number , address , driver ' s license_number or California identification_number -- or the person ' s name and at least six physical traits such_as height , weight , hair and eye color , and ethnicity . A Department_of_Justice operator will scan a list of felonious child_molesters and either confirm or deny a match , revealing the specific crime involved . Revenue from the calls , which cost $ 5 for the first minute and $ 2 for each additional minute , will be used to fund the program . Addresses of registrants or information about victims will not be released . Nor will callers be able to obtain a blanket list of registered sex offenders in their community . Parents can use the information to keep their children from associating with the offender . To guard against vigilantism , the 900 number leaves a record of the caller ' s location ( calls cannot be made from a pay phone ) and there are enhanced penalties for crimes committed against those on the list . * Nevertheless , &quot; the misidentification and discrimination resulting from this bill is going_to be really unbelievable , &quot; predicted Francisco Lobaco , legislative director of the California American Civil Liberties Union . &quot; You can go_back 30 years on somebody who otherwise has rehabilitated themselves , reintegrated into society . Not only that sex offender , but their spouses and children are pariahs forever . Whether it solves any problems in society is problematic at best , &quot; he added . Some social_workers believe that the public ostracism will further drive pedophiles underground , hampering their recovery and making_it more likely they may offend again . Fred Berlin , founder of the Sexual Disorders Clinic at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , said that while some of those who become sexually involved with_children may exhibit a lack of conscience or social responsibility , others have an abnormal sexual orientation that cannot be punished or legislated away . Contrary to the image that fuels the legal crackdown -- faceless monsters kidnaping and murdering children on the street -- he said , &quot; Tragically , one of the most dangerous places for children is in the home. &quot; Misdemeanor molestation cases , which are less violent , are not covered by these new laws . Berlin said pedophiles ' behavior can be modified , sometimes with drugs , to abstain even if they are not &quot; cured. &quot; In one study of 600 treated offenders , 92 % were free_of accusations after five years , he said . Opponents worry the measure will open a floodgate of access to other types of offenders . &quot; One concern is the next step would be the same for people arrested but not convicted , &quot; said Mary Broderick , executive_director of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice , a statewide organization of criminal defense_lawyers . Said legislation sponsor Alby : &quot; Obviously the victims and myself would like to do a lot more . . . . The criminal justice system has been totally ineffectual in keeping the public safe . These people are not bank robbers . These people are terrible people. &quot; To her , the trade-off is easy . &quot; I say , real simple : You rape a child , your right_to_privacy is the least of things I ' d see you lost , if I had any choice at all. &quot;</TEXT>
