   <HEADLINE> STATE OF EMERGENCY IMPOSED AFTER SRI LANKAN VOTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sri Lankans voted for a new Parliament on Tuesday , and the government imposed a state of emergency after the polls closed_in an attempt at preventing more of the violence that scarred the campaign . Tamil rebels who opposed the election blew_up a navy ship in northern Sri Lanka during the vote , and 25 minor clashes between rival party supporters were reported throughout the day . Twenty-four people died in more_than 3 # 000 street clashes during the monthlong campaign , and police expect more violence if the governing United National Party loses its 17-year grip on power . The emergency decree gave police the right to arrest and detain people without charge , and a round-the-clock curfew , expected to last until Thursday morning , was declared nationwide . Election results are not expected until today . There have been no reliable opinion polls , but analysts said the socialist People ' s Alliance , a coalition of five opposition parties , stands a good chance of winning . The coalition has promised to strip the presidency of many of its powers . It also has pledged to negotiate with the guerrillas , who have fought for a Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka for 11 years .</TEXT>
