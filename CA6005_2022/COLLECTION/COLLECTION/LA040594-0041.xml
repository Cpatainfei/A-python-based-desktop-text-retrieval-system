   <TEXT> Outside , an icy wind funnels down from the Kremlin into one of Moscow ' s most popular shopping streets , but inside Bread Store No . 755 , the air is warm , damp and pungent . The homey aroma of fresh-baked Russian black_bread mingles with the odor of wet wool overcoats . There is also the unmistakable smell of raw capitalism as people surge toward the counter to buy , buy , buy -- even at prices they consider unthinkable . For Russia ' s last mammoth Soviet-era government monopoly -- bread -- is ever so gradually being wrested from state control and placed into private hands . It is a politically delicate , even spiritually traumatic process . Cheap , plentiful bread was the very symbol of the Bolshevik Revolution , and Vladimir I . Lenin came_to power in 1917 on the slogan &quot; Peace , Land , Bread. &quot; Bread stayed cheap and plentiful even in the poorest days of the Soviet_Union , the best-kept covenant between the Communists and the masses . For three decades , the price of a dense , round loaf of rye_bread remained unchanged at 16 kopeks . It was so cheap that peasants fed it to their pigs . In 1991 , as the Soviet_Union lay on its deathbed , authorities broke a sacred taboo and raised bread prices . Then , last October , President Boris N . Yeltsin decontrolled prices entirely , and by last week a loaf of rye_bread cost 376 rubles -- still only 21 cents , but 2 # 262 times what it cost just three years ago . Consumption has dropped between 10 % and 12 % -- not because people are eating less but because they are wasting less and have stopped feeding bread to their livestock , said Alexander A . Chistyakov of the Russian Committee for Grain Products . &quot; Bread should be expensive , not cheap , &quot; declared Chistyakov , a statement that would have been capitalist anathema two years ago . &quot; People are beginning to behave more rationally. &quot; Today , a new generation of revolutionaries is trying to do the unthinkable : make money from bread . The owner of store No . 755 , Natalia D . Pelenitsina , is a former medical textbook editor turned bakery entrepreneur . In a startling break_with tradition , Pelenitsina has managed to train her employees not to be surly to the customers -- though it is impossible to train the customers not to be nasty to the workers about the ever-increasing prices . Pelenitsina has also instructed employees to sell the warm bread first , forsaking the Soviet custom of trying to force customers to buy_up every_last scrap of old bread before letting them have the fresh stuff . About three months ago , Pelenitsina at last persuaded the bread factory to bring fresh bread several times a day , especially in the morning , when the customers want it . Previously , the bread typically came at closing time and sat overnight , unwrapped , growing cold and stale . &quot; Bread was supposed to come four times a day every day , but it never did , &quot; she said . &quot; They always brought it when it was convenient for the factory , not when it was convenient for the store or for the customers. &quot; Russians are fussy about their bread , and many bakeries offer customers a spoon with which to prod the loaves to test their freshness . &quot; It ' s easier to force bad bananas on the customers than stale bread , &quot; said Vladimir Y . Panichev , director of the Vykhino Confectionery and Bread Baking Factory in southeast Moscow . Russians speak_of their daily bread in almost religious terms . &quot; Bread is father , mother and water , &quot; one proverb says . Bread Store No . 755 has developed a reputation for always having fresh bread on_hand . Several customers said they come from other neighborhoods to buy_it , as well as imported tea and cookies , fresh cakes , pizzas and steaming pirogi , or buns stuffed with pork , potatoes and cabbage , that the employees make themselves . Together , these and other innovations have helped Bread Shop No . 755 boost sales from 2 # 000 loaves a day when Pelenitsina took_over three years ago to 5 # 000 loaves daily now . She gives much of the credit for the turnaround to the Western-style management advice she received from Arthur Andersen &amp; Co . executives under a program funded by the_British government . Pelenitsina raves about the extensive help she received , which included personal_business tutorials , a 10-day trip to London and a visit from former British Prime_Minister Edward Heath -- but not a kopek of financial_aid . Inspired by her success , Pelenitsina has borrowed $ 40 # 000 and is building a small bakery of_her_own in what was the crumbling back of the bread store . It will be staffed mostly by her 40-ish , overeducated , unemployed friends . &quot; At my cash_register is the former head engineer for a defense_contractor , &quot; Pelenitsina explained , pointing_out a middle-aged woman in a blue apron , one of 25 employees who earn an average of $ 74 a month . &quot; Of course , it ' s a big comedown for her . But since they are not being paid there , she has to do something else. &quot; Such innovation , born of government decree and economic despair , is beginning to ripple through what was once one of the world ' s most inefficient food production chains . Ever so gradually , the privatization of Roskhlebprodukt , the giant state grain monopoly , has begun . The massive organization consists_of 3 # 000 separate enterprises that once controlled and subsidized every link of the grain chain , from the elevators that bought grain from the collective_farms to the millers and bakers and bread distributors . Under a decree signed by Yeltsin in December , all but 140 of the enterprises were to be sold_off by April 1 , said Igor V . Kazankin , who is handling the privatization program at the State Property Committee . Despite delays , Kazankin said the turnover will still be accomplished before July 1 , when the vouchers that Russian citizens can use to buy shares_in privatizing enterprises are_due to expire . The slow unraveling of state control has now begun to touch private farmers , who account_for 15 % of the grain sold to the flour millers of Moscow . The millers and the giant bakeries now operate without state subsidies . And competition , a concept that remains alien two years after Russia set_out to form a free market , is keeping bread prices from rising even faster . &quot; There is extremely tough competition among bread bakers , &quot; Panichev said . &quot; It is rather dangerous and unprofitable to raise bread prices sharply. &quot; Political opposition to making money from the staff_of_life remains high . Although Yeltsin decontrolled the price of bread by decree in October , a law passed_by the old Supreme Soviet that banned reaping more_than 15 % profit from baking or selling bread expired only on Jan . 1 . Worried that price-gouging will create a political backlash , the bread factories still don ' t allow the retail_stores they supply to add more_than a 15 % markup to their bread . Some local authorities have also imposed profit restrictions . Price-fixing among Moscow ' s 40 large bread factories does go_on , but it is informal and sporadic , Panichev said . The difference is that it is bakers , not central planners , setting prices based on the cost of flour , oil , electricity and other costs . Some factories absorb these costs as long as possible in_order to have a jump_on their competitors , he said . To give stores an incentive to sell bread , the city of Moscow does not collect taxes on stores where 65 % of the wares are bread or bread products . To increase profits , more and more bread stores also peddle everything from baby food to blue_jeans , candy_bars and sometimes even alcohol . &quot; Bread stores would rather sell anything but bread , &quot; Panichev complained . &quot; Vodka does not go stale. &quot; Despite the regulatory limitations and the deregulatory confusion , reformers believe that the lifting of government controls over bread production will bring Russians more psychological and economic independence from the state that once fed them like children -- and demanded childlike obedience . &quot; With the demise of the bread monopoly , the last vestige of Soviet rule will finally collapse , &quot; said economist and newspaper_columnist Mikhail L . Berger . &quot; Giving_up land and bread amounts to giving_up power and control over the people . . . . &quot; If bread becomes an item of commerce and ceases to be a super-sacred thing , like bread and wine at church Communion , people will stop worshiping the current leadership , &quot; Berger said .
