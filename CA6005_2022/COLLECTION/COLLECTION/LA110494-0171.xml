   <HEADLINE> VOTER GROUP FAVORS BROWN , FEINSTEIN ; OPPOSES PROP . 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steven Grimshaw voted for Pete Wilson in 1990 and until this week figured he ' d vote Tuesday to give the battle-scarred governor another four years on_the_job . But Grimshaw , 44 , a West Hills Republican , now says he plans to vote for Wilson ' s challenger , Democrat Kathleen Brown . The reason : Grimshaw liked Brown ' s 62-page booklet spelling_out her vision for California . Wilson , says Grimshaw , has said too_little about where he wants to lead the state . &quot; She ' s got a plan for the future , &quot; Grimshaw says of the state_treasurer . &quot; We ' ve got_to start there. &quot; As the long campaign_for_governor heads into its closing days , Brown ' s task is to find and reach several hundred_thousand Steven Grimshaws -- independent-minded voters who are tired_of political mudslinging and receptive to her pledge to restore the Golden State to its former luster . Wilson ' s campaign aides say Brown faces an almost impossible task . Independent polls and conventional wisdom tend to support that contention . But Brown and her advisers say the Democrat ' s positive message is catching_on -- and they contend that a huge Election_Day effort will bring_out people who have not voted regularly and thus are not included in many polls . Grimshaw was among 15 San Fernando Valley residents who met with a Times reporter and an editor three times in the final five weeks of the campaign . Undecided in the governor ' s race when the sessions began in early October , these voters shared their views and discussed their reactions to the campaigns as they made_up their minds . The group was far too small to be a representative_sample , and the participants ' behavior undoubtedly was affected by their involvement in the project . But the panel nonetheless provides a window into the thoughts of one group of voters . The group included a mixture of Democrats and Republicans , men and women , ages 27 to 71 . Most are working , two are unemployed , and all are probably more interested in politics -- and informed about the issues -- than the average voter . In the final session Wednesday night , a majority said they had decided to vote for Brown over Wilson -- a reversal of the first tally taken_in early October . By a wide margin , they also said they would vote to reelect U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein over Rep . Mike Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) . And they were decidedly against Proposition 187 , the controversial immigration control initiative . Although almost every member of the group believes that illegal immigration is a major problem , the tally was 10 to 4 against the ballot measure , which would expel undocumented children from the public_schools and deny other services , except emergency health_care , to people not residing here legally . Felipe Hervias , a 27-year-old computer_programmer from Reseda , says police_officers whom he encounters in Los Angeles already act_as if he is a gang member . The Caltech employee said the initiative would make him even more suspect , simply because of the color of his skin . &quot; It ' s going_to cause a lot of harm -- harm to me , &quot; Hervias said . The margin against Proposition 187 among the participants might have been even greater except for an angry backlash against the tactics of the initiative ' s opponents . Protests involving high_school students and rallies in which demonstrators carried the Mexican flag have angered several of these mainstream voters and soured them on the opposition ' s campaign . &quot; I know it ' s no good , but I ' m offended by the people who are against it , &quot; said Marvin Hershman , a contracts manager at Litton Industries . &quot; I ' m offended by the way the students are carrying_on in school . So I might just vote for it on principle. &quot; Although they felt strongly about illegal immigration , many members of the group did not place much importance on how the candidates for governor and the Senate stood on Proposition 187 . In the Senate_race , 10 of the panelists said they would vote for Feinstein and five said they either would not vote_in the race or would choose a third-party candidate . None were for Huffington . But none of Feinstein ' s backers said they were angered by Huffington ' s support for the immigration initiative , and only a_few said they were influenced by the revelation that the congressman had employed an illegal immigrant to care_for his children . Instead , most cited Feinstein ' s record , Huffington ' s lack of one , or the Republican ' s attempt to &quot; buy the election &quot; with his huge personal fortune . In the governor ' s race , where the tally was 10 to 5 for Brown , three of Wilson ' s supporters said they would vote against Proposition 187 , which the governor vigorously supports . And three of Brown ' s backers said they would vote for the initiative even though Brown has condemned it . The same sort of crossover occurred on other issues . Most of Brown ' s supporters -- unlike the candidate -- favor the death_penalty , and many worry that she will be more eager than Wilson to raise taxes . But they do not dwell_on those details . Instead , most of those who said they would vote for Brown cited her written plan , in which she lays_out a point-by-point agenda for education , economic_growth , fighting crime and battling illegal immigration . They were more impressed by the idea of the plan than its specifics ; few could recall individual proposals that they liked . &quot; I don ' t want to reelect the governor , &quot; said Joseph Jurick , a West Hills Democrat who works as an aerospace_engineer for Hughes Aircraft . &quot; I will vote for Brown mainly because she ' s got a vision of what she wants to do . With Wilson , it ' s like he ' s on a raft going_down the stream -- no rudder. &quot; Two weeks ago , Marsha Frame , an accountant , said she had no interest in reading Brown ' s detailed plan . The candidate , Frame said , should be able to spell_out her agenda in a_few simple sentences . But the Reseda Democrat changed her tune after the Brown campaign mailed her a copy of the document . &quot; I started reading and went_for about an hour and a half , &quot; Frame said . &quot; I have to eat my words . It did sway me toward Kathleen Brown because she did put something down. &quot; But others said Brown ' s many promises sound too good to be true . &quot; These things she is talking_about are utopian , &quot; said Takuro Nakae , a retired engineer and a Republican . &quot; At least with Wilson we know what he can do and what he can ' t do. &quot; Steven Glazer , a senior adviser to Brown , said the campaign has printed more_than 1.5 million copies of the plan and has mailed_out most of them and distributed 500 # 000 at public events . He said The Times ' focus group reflects the tendency of many voters to leave their political deliberations till the last minute . He said the campaign believes that many of those voters have kept a copy of Brown ' s plan handy and will consult it when they make their final_decision . &quot; The electorate , &quot; Glazer said , &quot; is unhappy with the direction of the state and yearns for serious and substantive answers. &quot; But Dan Schnur , a spokesman for Wilson , said that almost all_the voters already have made_up their minds , and most of those are going_to vote for the governor . He said the remaining undecideds , such_as the members of The Times ' panel , are heavily weighted toward Democrats and could be expected to tilt toward Brown , but there are too few of them to carry her to victory . Schnur said Wilson invites voters to judge him on his record ; he doesn ' t need a slickly printed brochure to get his points across . But with Wilson ' s job approval rating still low compared to that of other California governors who have sought reelection , his campaign has worked hard to portray Brown as a risky choice who is out of step with the voters . After viewing a barrage of Wilson television ads blasting Brown for her stands on crime , immigration and taxes , many voters who are not fond of the governor have concluded that he is the lesser of two evils . &quot; I don ' t like it , but I would vote for this Republican , &quot; said Hershman , the Litton contracts manager . &quot; We ' ve had worse in the past. &quot; How Voters ' Views Were Gauged To learn what voters are thinking , The Times , assisted by Davis Research of Calabasas , selected a group of San Fernando Valley residents who have voted_in at least two of the last three elections and were undecided about the race for governor . The group included a cross-section of voters but was far too small to be a representative_sampling of the electorate . The Times talked to the same voters three times to learn what has made them decide how to vote . The final discussion took_place Wednesday over dinner provided by The Times at its Chatsworth office .</TEXT>
