   <HEADLINE> FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES : A FINANCIAL PAUL REVERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the most remarkable aspects of the Orange Country financial debacle is that so few people saw it coming . Now , one newsletter is taking credit for spotting it -- albeit indirectly -- along with several other recent news_events , including future House Speaker Newt Gingrich ' s lobbing of verbal &quot; hand_grenades &quot; in the direction of the Clinton_Administration . Santa Monica-based Future News Index , which compiles predictions of business and economic trends by monitoring several dozen forecasters who themselves pay close attention to astrological developments , claims in its current report that it predicted those events by forecasting such things as &quot; geological and geopolitical turmoil &quot; and &quot; big moves_in the markets. &quot; Those forecasts , it contends , foreshadowed the recent earthquake aftershocks , the guilty plea entered by former Associate Atty . Gen . Webster L . Hubbell , Gingrich ' s fights with the Clinton_Administration , and even Orange County ' s bankruptcy filing . Paul D . Farrell , president of the forecasting service , said the prediction came_about with &quot; Jupiter and Pluto both being squared by Mars , &quot; which he said led to predictions of ripples in the markets . According to the Future News Index analysis for this week , the Orange County bankruptcy filing &quot; was the latest trigger . Ah , the dark side of this bear_market ! Derivatives . Deficits . Debts . All beginning to surface . Biting the hands that fed them. &quot; Lowering His Expectations Jerry Brown has discovered the &quot; era of limits &quot; that has long been familiar to Californians trying to sell their homes . The former governor ' s Pacific Heights spread in San Francisco is_on the market . And his real_estate_agent , Florian McGuire Moore , reports that he ' s just lowered the asking price to $ 1.2 million from $ 1.4 million . Got a Lovely Bunch of Hotels Beverly Hills Hilton owner Merv Griffin is now spinning the wheel of fortune in Scottsdale , Ariz . Griffin is paying about $ 15 million to add the Scottsdale Hilton Resort and Spa near Phoenix to his hotel group . The property was put_up for_sale by banking giant Citicorp , along with real_estate giant Trammell Crow . Originally the lender , Citicorp had become an equity partner as well through a series of restructurings . Like most real_estate assets , the hotel fetched much less than it did the last time it changed hands : in the mid-1980s , it went_for about $ 23 million . Pet Sounds The offbeat seminar business continues to thrive in Southern California . One recent offering by the &quot; Berkeley Psychic Institute of Anaheim &quot; was a &quot; Pet Healing and Communication Workshop. &quot; A workshop brochure asks : &quot; Ever wondered what your pet is thinking ? Have you known each other before ? In this workshop , you will explore these questions and more. &quot; It further promises attendees will learn &quot; spiritual healing techniques that you can use with your pets. &quot;</TEXT>
