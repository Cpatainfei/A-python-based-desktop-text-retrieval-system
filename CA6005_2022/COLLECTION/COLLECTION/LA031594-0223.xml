   <HEADLINE> POSTSCRIPT ; A SALVADORAN REBEL ' S ODYSSEY FROM OUTLAW TO POLITICIAN ; NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE NIDIA DIAZ HOPES TO CHANGE SOCIETY PEACEFULLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As she moves from town to town campaigning for a seat in the Salvadoran legislature , Nidia Diaz meets friendly crowds who remember her legendary toughness in the face of military torture . But she also meets hecklers , people who sneer at her with disdain : &quot; Guerrillera ! &quot; &quot; With pride , thank_you , &quot; she responds . Through 12 years of El_Salvador ' s brutal civil_war , Diaz was one of the best-known guerrilleras , women rebels . In 1985 , it was Diaz ' s guerrilla faction that killed four U.S. Marines and nine civilians at a sidewalk cafe in San Salvador ' s Zona Rosa . That same year , Comandante Diaz was shot five times in an ambush , captured and held by the Salvadoran military for more_than six months . She was eventually released in exchange for the daughter of then-President Jose Napoleon Duarte , whom guerrillas had kidnaped . And today she is a candidate for the National Assembly , one of hundreds of former guerrillas who are participating in historic elections taking_place Sunday . Under U.N.-brokered peace accords that formally ended the war in 1992 , Marxist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front , who for years fought a series of U.S.-backed governments , agreed to put_down their weapons and form a political_party . The former rebels will be testing their political strength at the polls for the first time , after more_than a decade of rejecting elections as a farce . As much as any Salvadoran , Diaz embodies the difficult transition from warrior to politician . &quot; She is a case study of what it takes_for a guerrilla commander -- a tough one like she was -- to be transformed into a successful , . . . practical , pragmatic political_leader , concerned with the day-to-day problems of her constituency , &quot; said Michael Gucovsky , until recently deputy chief of the U.N. peacekeeping mission here . &quot; She has become much more willing to engage in give_and_take , and not see issues in black_and_white . . . . The future of El_Salvador lies ( with ) leaders like her who have made this transition. &quot; The faction once commanded by Diaz , the Revolutionary Party of Central_American Workers , was one of five groups operating under the FMLN umbrella . All five factions are now legal political_parties , each contributing to the FMLN ' s full slate of candidates for the national legislature and mayoral seats . The FMLN has joined in coalition with the leftist Democratic Convergence political_party to support legislator Ruben Zamora for president . The ruling Nationist Republican Alliance candidate is Armando Calderon Sol . Like the other guerrillas , Diaz , 41 , has traded her combat_fatigues in_for civilian clothes . Although wartime scars on her arm are still visible , she now wears pumps and pearls . She registered for the election under her real name , Maria Marta Valladares , but is campaigning under her revolutionary nom_de_guerre , Nidia Diaz . &quot; On the personal level , this is my first experience being submitted to the will of the people , &quot; Diaz said in an interview at party headquarters . &quot; The positions of responsibility that I have had before were always given to me , or I was elected to them , by a small segment of society -- militants of our party . The decision of a small group . &quot; Today I am subject_to a popular consultation . You could say I am in a display_window , awaiting approval or rejection . And the test that is coming is a difficult one. &quot; Much of the political right refuses to believe that Diaz and other former rebels are committed to democracy . They say their campaign is a charade . But the leftists press_on , and as El_Salvador struggles to rebuild after a war that cost about 75 # 000 lives , Diaz has come further than most . Scorned for years by U.S._governments because of her comrades ' role in the Zona Rosa murders , she more recently attended last year ' s July 4 party at the U.S. Embassy here . But change comes slowly in El_Salvador . Continuing political violence has hit especially close to Diaz and her faction . Francisco Velis and Mario Lopez , two senior FMLN leaders , were killed late last year during a spate of unsolved murders . The Velis case is believed to be a political hit , while the Lopez killing took_place during a foiled robbery . Both belonged_to Diaz ' s Revolutionary Workers party . And then , on Feb . 24 , Diaz narrowly escaped an apparent assassination attempt . Gunmen sprayed her car with automatic gunfire , wounding her bodyguard , but Diaz had been dropped_off shortly before the attack . Because of the car ' s darkened windows , no one on the outside could have known whether she was in the car . To underscore her lingering concerns , Diaz has not yet brought her 12-year-old son , Jose Alejandro , to El_Salvador from his exile home_in Sweden . Diaz says her background is sufficiently diverse to prepare her for democratic politics . She was a poll-watcher in elections in 1972 and 1977 and over the years worked -- albeit clandestinely -- with women ' s groups , in human_rights and organizing peasants . Now , she says , the left ' s challenge is to become an effective political force that can continue to provoke change . &quot; It is the first time we are going_to participate in state institutions , &quot; she said . &quot; It implies a much greater level of responsibility and coherence . A single decision can touch_on so many other ( issues ) . &quot; Diaz first attracted international attention when she participated in the first round of peace talks in 1984 between Duarte and the FMLN in the northern town of La Palma . She was one of several guerrilla commanders who came_down from the mountains to join the ultimately fruitless talks . The next year , on April 18 , she was part of a guerrilla patrol that was strafed by government aircraft in San Vicente province . Several companions were killed , and she was shot in the arm , back and legs and taken prisoner by ground troops . Diaz says her principal captor was an American military adviser . In her 1988 book , &quot; Nunca Estuve Sola &quot; ( &quot; I Was Never Alone &quot; ) , she describes him as &quot; bearded , blond with Ray Bans. &quot; &quot; The yankee , with more force , twisted my left arm backwards , and the pain made me react , &quot; she wrote . &quot; I felt alive and impotent ; I did not want to be there , I wanted to disappear. &quot; At the time , the U.S. Embassy denied her captor was linked to the U.S. military , saying he was a private citizen on contract to the Salvadoran Army to repair infrared equipment . News_reports later identified him as an American mercenary . Her captors loaded the wounded Diaz into a helicopter and transported her to a military base . Her initial medical treatment was cursory , she wrote , and she was deprived of sleep and tortured . Two months after her capture , Diaz ' s faction carried_out one of the war ' s most notorious massacres . An urban commando opened_fire on a strip of sidewalk cafes in San Salvador ' s Zona Rosa on June 19 . Four off-duty , unarmed Marines were killed , along with nine civilians . Although Diaz was in jail , U.S. officials accused her of responsibility because of her senior position in the Revolutionary Workers party . Diaz was freed on Oct . 25 , 1985 , with 21 other political_prisoners in a complex exchange for Duarte ' s daughter and 33 mayors and municipal officials , all_of whom had been kidnaped by the FMLN . In the years that followed , Diaz did political work in Cuba , Nicaragua and elsewhere . When serious peace talks began in 1990 , she formed part of the rebels ' delegation and eventually was one of 10 guerrilla commanders who signed the landmark peace accords on Jan . 16 , 1992 , which ended the long years of fighting . Accompanied by other rebel leaders , she returned to El_Salvador after years of exile on Feb . 1 , 1992 , and slowly began a return to civilian life . &quot; I have faith that what we are going_to achieve on March 20 ( Election_Day ) will change the relation of forces in the national political_system , &quot; Diaz said . &quot; Although we may_not win all levels of power , like the executive ( branch ) . . . we have a lot to gain as a new force. &quot;</TEXT>
