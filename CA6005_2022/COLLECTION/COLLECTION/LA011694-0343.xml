   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : SOUTH : SOUTH-CENTRAL ; LACK OF FUNDS MAY RAIN ON THEIR PARADE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At 17 , Billy Brown has already garnered invitations to play before thousands . Now he and the other members of the Washington High_School marching band and jazz ensemble have received another : to take_part next month in the Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans . &quot; From the way I ' m dressed people might think I ' m a gangbanger , &quot; said Brown , a lanky drummer who frowns with concentration as he practices . &quot; But when they see the determination on my face and when I play , then they look_at me in a different way. &quot; The chance to play venues such_as the Playboy Jazz_Festival at the Hollywood Bowl or an L.A. Rams football game at Anaheim Stadium is one benefit of Washington ' s music program . &quot; When they played the Playboy Jazz_Festival and were_on that stage , they got_to do what a lot of professionals still haven ' t gotten the chance to do : to share a stage with musicians like Branford Marsalis , &quot; said Fernando Pullum , director of the 130-member band and drill team . Principal Marguerite LaMotte said the band needs more instruments and funds . This month , several band members had to borrow instruments from other schools to participate in the city marching band championship , in which they placed first . &quot; I watched some of the kids on the field playing imaginary instruments during rehearsal as if they had the real_thing in their hands , &quot; LaMotte said . A lack of funds also threatens to cancel their trip to New Orleans . Although students have raised about $ 20 # 000 through bake sales , raffles and donations , they still need $ 40 # 000 for transportation and additional instruments . &quot; It would be a shame if the kids don ' t get a chance to go , &quot; Pullum said . Inside the small band room , students echo Pullum ' s words . Amid the sounds of impromptu jazz quartets , students use words such_as discipline , sacrifice and respect_to characterize their experience . &quot; You learn a lot about self-discipline , &quot; said Damien Crawford , 16 , a trombone_player . &quot; When you have discipline here you learn to have discipline for yourself at home. &quot; &quot; And it keeps us busy , &quot; said Dontoe Phillips , 15 . &quot; When you get_to go and play for a lot of famous people , how could you ever get bored ? &quot; &quot; Plus , &quot; said Antwan Rachal , 17 , who plays the cymbals , &quot; band can help you out_in school because you have to have a C average , so you have to do_well in_order to stay in band . And then there are the scholarships you can apply for. &quot; SANDRA HERNANDEZ</TEXT>
