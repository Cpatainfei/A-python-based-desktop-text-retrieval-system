   <HEADLINE> U.S. COMPANIES EDGE OUT JAPAN IN VEHICLE PRODUCTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time in 15 years , auto_makers built more cars , trucks and minivans in the United States than in Japan , according to estimates released Wednesday by Ward ' s Automotive Reports . The Detroit-based trade publication said U.S. auto output totaled 12.2 million units in 1994 , up from 10.9 million in 1993 . That compares with an estimated 11 million vehicles built_in Japan this year . Experts attribute the turnaround to the growing popularity of domestic vehicles , particularly trucks , and increased auto output from so-called Japanese transplant factories here . &quot; Clearly the auto industry is booming , and the transplants are building a lot more vehicles here than before , &quot; one analyst said . &quot; The Big Three are also cranking_out the trucks. &quot; Japanese car_companies have been shifting production to the United States to offset the effects of the slumping dollar against the Japanese yen . The move has allowed Japanese car_makers to increase their share of the U.S. vehicle market slightly through the first 11 months of the year , to 23.3 % from 23.1 % a year ago , as transplant factories were able to maintain production while several Big Three plants were shut_down for model changeovers . In 1994 , Ward ' s estimated , Japanese transplant factories will account_for about 17.3 % of all vehicles built_in the United States , Canada and Mexico , up from 16 % in 1992 . The shift is likely to continue for several years as Japanese companies such_as Toyota Motor Corp . and Honda Motor Co . expand their presence in North_America , and European car_makers such_as Mercedes-Benz and BMW establish a beachhead in the United States . Honda has already announced plans to build an additional 110 # 000 cars at plants in Ohio and Ontario . Toyota recently announced it will stop shipping compact pickup_trucks to the United States from Japan and instead will build them at a joint-venture factory with General Motors Corp . in California . Nissan Motor Co . plans to start shipping about 2 # 000 Nissan Sentra cars from Mexico next year , eliminating the need for more costly exports from Japan . Analysts expect U.S. car and truck sales to rise about 9 % this year to about 15.4 million vehicles . Ward ' s estimated the shift to North_American factories pushed total output in the United States , Mexico and Canada to a record 15.75 million vehicles , with trucks , minivans and sport utility vehicles accounting_for a record 47.3 % of total sales . In 1992 , North_American output totaled 12.8 million vehicles , 41.6 % of them trucks .</TEXT>
