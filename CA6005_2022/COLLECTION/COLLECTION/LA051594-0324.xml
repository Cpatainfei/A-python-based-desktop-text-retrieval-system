   <HEADLINE> OPTICAL VS . MAGNETIC ; TWO O.C. FIRMS BET_ON DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE FUTURE OF COMPUTER STORAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the Irvine Spectrum Business Park , Pinnacle Micro Inc. ' s two-story building looks_up_to Western Digital Corp. ' s 14-story headquarters like David looked_up_to mighty Goliath . Barely a stone ' s throw apart , these computer storage companies have lived_in peaceful coexistence for years , because a technological wall separated their industries . But with the advent of multimedia technology -- where computers combine sound , text , graphics and video to produce film-like images -- the neighbors may soon become adversaries . Pinnacle , a maker of optical storage_devices begun by a father-and-son team in 1987 , senses an opportunity and is readying its slingshot . Western Digital , an established maker of magnetic_disk drives with $ 1.2 billion in annual sales , said it is not worried that it will suffer Goliath ' s fate . Each company ' s products perform the same basic function : storing computer data . Whichever can do that better at the best price will have a future ; the other may be left spinning in the dustbin of history . &quot; We have a lot of skeptics out there , &quot; said Scott Blum , who co-founded Pinnacle Micro Inc. with his father , Bill . &quot; Our belief is that optical disks will be around 30 years from now and magnetic won ' t exist , &quot; said the younger Blum , who serves as executive_vice_president . &quot; This is what we ' ve worked_on for seven years . It ' s David versus Goliath. &quot; At stake for the winner is a share of the multibillion-dollar storage industry , where demand is expected to explode with the fast-approaching information superhighway ' s vast appetite for data storage . Not every computer user cares who survives this battle . However , it matters_to tens of thousands of workers -- from engineers to assembly_line workers -- who make their living in the PC storage industry , which so far has remained largely American-owned despite strategic efforts by foreigners to grab a foothold . The $ 700-million optical disk-drive industry is puny next to the $ 8.3 billion spent on magnetic hard_disk drives each year , based on estimates by market researchers Disk / Trend Inc. in Mountain View , Calif. , and Freeman Associates Inc. in Santa Barbara . The size of the magnetic_disk drive industry mushrooms to $ 23.6 billion when sales of stand-alone drives are included , in addition to those sold as part of computers . It will be difficult to mount a serious challenge to the magnetic_disk drive manufacturers , who grew on the enormous success of the personal_computer . The disk_drive serves as the permanent memory system for the PC . But Pinnacle ' s executives believe business and home users will eventually favor their type of storage system , which is expected to undergo a major enhancement next year , while rivals run_into technological obstacles . * Scott Blum said Pinnacle is set to release its enhancement project , code-named Diablo , in the spring of 1995 . For the first time , he said , an optical disk_drive will cross a threshold and cost less than similar high-capacity magnetic_disk drives . Blum , 30 , said Diablo will force magnetic drive makers to take_notice . Pinnacle ' s best drives are priced at $ 3.80 per megabyte , compared to 75 cents per megabyte for standard magnetic drives , but with Diablo , the company hopes to greatly reduce the price gap . Executives at the magnetic hard_disk companies dismiss such claims as extreme optimism . &quot; The epitaph of the disk_drive industry was written in the mid-1980s when optical first appeared , &quot; said Peter Knight , vice_president of business development at Conner Peripherals Inc. in San Jose , a top disk_drive maker . &quot; Many theorists stood_up and talked_about how the fundamental limit of the disk_drive was coming . I thought optical would be a serious challenger . As time goes_on , it ' s clear that isn ' t the case. &quot; Gary Marks , vice_president of marketing at Western Digital , believes optical drives will remain but a small part of the total storage market . &quot; We don ' t have tunnel vision , &quot; Marks said . &quot; There will be peaceful coexistence between hard_disks and optical for a long time. &quot; * Marks ' view is shared by industry experts such_as Bob Katzive , a vice_president at Disk / Trend Inc. , and Phil Devin , storage analyst for Dataquest Inc. , a market researcher in San Jose . &quot; We don ' t see optical drives as a replacement for the magnetic hard_disk , &quot; Katzive said . &quot; They ' re good for storing things as archives . But if you need to ( change ) it fast , the hard_disk drive is better. &quot; Basically , an optical drive uses a laser to read bumps and grooves on a metal platter , like a compact_disc player . In magnetic_disks , a mechanical head reads the magnetic pattern on the metal disk . In both technologies , the disks spin past a head , which reads the data or changes it based on commands from the computer ' s main processor . Optical drives are a newer and fundamentally more complex technology because they use lasers to read the data . This ability to alter or &quot; write &quot; on the disk quickly is key to a disk_drive system , but for optical drives , it is still too slow and expensive -- which puts their manufacturers at a disadvantage . &quot; I think read / write optical is a ways off , &quot; said Charles Haggerty , chief_executive of Western Digital . &quot; Going_forward for at least four to five years , magnetic is going_to be the way to go. &quot; But Bill Blum , 59 , stresses that &quot; rewriteable &quot; optical technology -- which allows data to be repeatedly recorded and erased -- has been_on the market for only four years , compared to more_than a decade for magnetic . &quot; We can put more information per square_inch ( of disk ) than them , and we just started , &quot; Scott Blum said . &quot; They ' re pushing the limits . We ' re just beginning to make advances. &quot; And it is next to impossible to forecast the best technology for the future based on those that prevail today , said Bob Abraham , vice_president of Freeman Associates . &quot; No one really knows where the physical limits are , &quot; Abraham said . Technological advance is a game of numbers . If Pinnacle improves its optical technology faster than competing magnetic_disk drive companies , then it will gain_ground in sales . Speed , capacity and price matter the most . Analysts , however , say that optical technology is behind on every front . Pinnacle had about $ 39 million in sales last year . With barely 100 employees , it competes against Japanese rivals including Sony Corp. , Panasonic and Olympus . Its principal customers are businesses that have huge archives , especially defense companies . Growth for optical companies has been slow but steady over the last few years , for which the Blum family said it is thankful . &quot; We would have been wiped_out by big companies coming_into the market , &quot; Scott Blum said . &quot; Now we ' ve had a chance to establish ourselves. &quot; The next step for Pinnacle is to overcome the challenges optical drive makers face , which include developing better lasers that can read data squeezed into ever tighter spaces on a disk . It must build its drives_in smaller packages to match the size standard of magnetic_disk drives . It must also improve its &quot; write &quot; speeds , or the time it takes_to record data , several times over to catch_up_with magnetic drives . * Much of this advancement depends_on how quickly new laser heads are developed , and Pinnacle is dependent_on the Japanese companies that manufacture them . Considering the obstacles , some optical players have simply decided not to directly challenge their magnetic hard_disk rivals . &quot; We don ' t think there will be a war between the two technologies , &quot; said Jim Kaufmann , vice_president of sales and marketing for Most Inc. , a Cypress-based optical storage company partly owned by Nakamichi Corp . in Tokyo . &quot; It ' s important for optical not to take the hard_disk drive guys on head-on because they are continually making performance improvements. &quot; That is certainly the case at Western Digital , which is one of the world ' s five top makers of magnetic drives . It has 6 # 375 employees on three continents and is considered a global technology leader . Western Digital has doubled the capacity of its hard_disk drives every 16 months . Marc Nussbaum , vice_president of engineering for Western Digital , says there is no foreseeable &quot; brick wall &quot; to such advances . In fact , a new technology expected to be_on the market in 1995 -- magnetic resistive heads -- will virtually quadruple capacity on magnetic_disk drives . And last year Western Digital established a new standard for magnetic hard_disk drives -- dubbed the enhanced intelligent drive interface -- to accommodate ever higher storage levels . While typical drives today store a maximum of 528 megabytes -- equal_to about 264 # 000 typewritten pages -- future ones could hold 10 times as much , thanks in part to the new technology standard , Nussbaum said . This could make magnetic technology competitive for years and therefore pave Western Digital ' s on-ramp to the information superhighway . The unanswered question is when magnetic drive makers will max out_in their ability to stretch capacity . &quot; Sooner or later there will be a limit for magnetic , &quot; said Peter Rentzepis , a chemistry professor at UC Irvine who is working_on an $ 18-million project to develop an optical drive of the future . &quot; The only way to overcome it is with optical . How soon ? I cannot say. &quot; * A competitive advantage for optical is that the disks are removable . You can pop_out one disk and put_in another . That means that while it costs three times more to purchase an optical drive , it costs little to add more disks to increase the total capacity . In March , Pinnacle introduced its Orray optical disk_drive , a $ 14 # 995 model aimed at the high end of the magnetic market , a niche known as disk arrays that bundle a dozen disk_drives together to achieve massive storage , safe from accidental loss . It can store 5.2 gigabytes of data , enough to hold a library of books in electronic form . &quot; This makes a dent in the magnetic_disk drive ' s armor , &quot; Scott Blum said . &quot; You won ' t be able to see that dent with a magnifying glass , &quot; countered Amyl Ahola , vice_president of worldwide marketing for Seagate Technology Corp . The Scotts Valley , Calif. , company is the world ' s largest maker of magnetic_disk drives . &quot; For optical , they ' ve always been two years away from a breakthrough for 20 years . I see them as complementary technology , but not a rival. &quot; Pros and Cons * It takes longer for an optical disk to write data . But magnetic and optical drives have comparable speed in accessing recorded data . * Optical disks are not affected by airport X-ray_machines or other magnetic sources . * Optical cartridges allow large amounts of data to be transported with ease to another site , such_as a locked safe for security purposes . * Large-volume users can build a library of optical cartridges at less cost , increasing storage capacity without purchasing another hard_drive . Cartridges hold_up to 1.3 gigabytes . Optical disks are guaranteed for 30 years . * Magnetic drives are less expensive , making them more cost-effective for low-capacity uses . Average drive has 20 megabytes to two gigabytes . * Optical drives may be particularly useful for desktop_publishing , digital video or audio applications , which typically require large amounts of storage_space . Example : One movie requires two gigabytes of space . * Optical drives are read by a laser_beam rather than a magnetic_head , which can &quot; crash &quot; into disk and destroy data . Researched by JANICE L . JONES / Los Angeles Times How Optical Drive Works These drives incorporate a laser and are used for storing large volumes of data . The laser ' s narrow beam can write more data in less space than the magnetic drive . Writing data 1 . Laser heats a spot ; alloy layer crystallizes into loose particles . 2 . Write head passes_over the revolving disk , creating a magnetic_field that aligns the crystal particles according to positive or negative polarities , representing the binary language of computers , which is based on a system of zeros and ones . Reading data 1 . A second , weaker laser reflects off of aluminum surface . As beam passes_through alloy , crystallized particles polarize the light . 2 . Sensor receives polarized light and reads its binary_code . How Magnetic Drive Works Magnetic drives are standard in desktops , but are also used in supercomputers . Writing data 1 . Read / write head passes_over revolving disk . 2 . While passing under read / write head , particles are organized into magnetic bands according to their positive and negative polarities . Reading data 1 . Iron particles create a magnetic_field , generating a current through the coil . 2 . Computer &quot; reads &quot; direction of current and interprets its binary_code .
