   <TEXT> A glint of silver and a flash of fractured light -- blue , green and red -- mark the spot where a moment before a fish had been . In the dappled fast-water world of mountain streams , the rainbow_trout reigns supreme . It is a fish that stirs the imagination of fishermen and cooks alike . Named for the &quot; rainbow &quot; band that runs the length of its olive-green skin , the rainbow_trout is America ' s most popular sport fish . Wild trout are prized by fly fishermen for their fierce spirit and wily nature ( and &quot; catch and release &quot; is the honored rule ) . Plentiful fish from hatchery-stocked lakes and streams are the mainstay of many_a family fishing trip -- and many_a fish_fry . And those with a taste for &quot; catching &quot; trout without a hook can find farmed fish at almost any seafood counter . The culinary appeal of rainbow_trout is simple : The flesh is mild and tender , and the bones are few and easy to remove . The small , consistent size of farmed rainbows makes offering uniform portions a breeze . Whole or in fillets , this fish holds_up well in a variety of recipes and techniques . It can be baked , boiled , poached , grilled , steamed , pan-fried -- about the only preparation not well suited to the trout is stir-frying , because quick stirring over high heat breaks_up the flesh . Farm-raising trout allows producers to easily control growth and provide fish that are consistently sized . Generally weighing 3 / 4 to 1 pound each , these trout offer a perfect single-serving size . * Farmed fish have a somewhat milder flavor than wild trout . They also have a consistent flavor from fish to fish and season to season , whereas wild trout , depending_on where they are from and what they ' ve been eating , can have varying degrees of flavor intensity . Flesh color varies as well , from creamy white in farmed rainbows to a deep salmon-pink in some wild fish . It ' s no coincidence that trout are members of Salmonidae , the same family as salmon . They are very similar in many ways -- body shape , flesh type , bone structure -- and , in fact , large trout are interchangeable with salmon in recipes . With a lower oil content than salmon , farm-raised rainbow_trout have only 138 calories per 3 1 / 2-ounce serving , 59 milligrams cholesterol , 5 grams total fat and . 9 gram of the beneficial omega-3 fatty_acids . Figures for wild trout vary , depending_on where they are from , but they will have fewer calories and less fat , including omega-3s , than farmed . Cooked whole , possibly with a stuffing , the fish makes a generous serving . Some find eating a whole fish needlessly intimidating . It ' s easy . Simply cut the top fillet of the fish down to the backbone , then lift_off and discard the whole backbone with ribs , tail and head ( if still attached ) . The remaining fillet sits whole on the plate , ready for carefree eating . Trout fillets will weigh 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 pound each , a perfect size for pan-frying or broiling . ( If your seafood market has only whole trout , ask to have it filleted. ) The easiest way to cook fillets is also one of the best . Simply coat the fillets in flour seasoned with salt and pepper , then pan-fry to a golden brown . * To make a quick sauce , transfer the cooked trout fillets to a plate and cover to keep warm . Then add a little white_wine or lemon_juice to the pan , with a nut of butter if you like , along with chopped fresh herbs , capers , thinly sliced mushrooms -- whatever you like -- and cook just to heat , then spoon over the trout . For hearty appetites , serve two fillet portions , or accompany one fillet with plenty of sauteed or steamed vegetables alongside . Because of its mild flavor , trout benefits from assertive companion ingredients , such_as capers , dill , green or sweet red_peppers , ginger , lemon and so on . Coating the fish in cornmeal instead of flour before pan-frying creates an incomparably nutty , crunchy coating for this delicate fish . Use your imagination . Add some of your favorite ingredients and create your own culinary version of trout . * Flavors from the Mediterranean coast -- olive_oil , peppers , cumin and garlic -- are a delightful foil for the delicate flesh of trout . If you like , replace the trio of peppers with a single large sweet red , green or yellow pepper . THREE-PEPPER TROUT 2 tablespoons olive_oil 3 garlic_cloves , minced 1 / 2 medium sweet yellow pepper , cored and sliced 1 / 2 medium sweet red_pepper , cored and sliced 1 / 2 medium green_pepper , cored and sliced 1 teaspoon cumin_seeds or 1 / 2 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander Dash ground cloves Salt , pepper 4 large trout fillets , to equal 1 1 / 2 pounds total_Heat 1 tablespoon olive_oil in large skillet . Add garlic and saute until tender , about 1 minute . Add sweet yellow , red and green_peppers . Saute over medium heat , stirring occasionally , until tender , 3 to 5 minutes . Stir in cumin , coriander , cloves and salt and pepper to taste . Transfer to bowl and set_aside . Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive_oil to skillet . Fry trout fillets , skin-side down , 3 to 4 minutes . Turn fillets and spoon peppers mixture over . Cover skillet and cook over medium-low heat until trout are opaque through thickest part , 6 to 8 minutes longer . Transfer trout and peppers garnish to warmed dinner_plates and serve . Makes 4 servings . * The thin skin of trout not only is edible but also a tasty contrast to the tender flesh . Here the skin cooks to delicate crispiness in a one-sided cooking method . A non-stick pan makes frying tidy , but a standard skillet may also be used . CRISP-SIDED TROUT WITH GINGER SAUCE 4 large skin-on trout fillets , to equal 1 1 / 2 pounds total 2 teaspoons oil 1 bunch green_onions , trimmed and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy_sauce 2 tablespoons sake or white_wine Dash red_pepper flakes Cut 3 shallow diagonal slashes in skin side of each trout fillet . Heat oil in large non-stick skillet and add fillets , skin-side down ( 2 at time , if skillet is not large enough ) . Cover and cook over medium-high heat until tops of fillets are opaque , 3 to 4 minutes . Remove cover and continue cooking until skin is crisp and brown and flesh is opaque through thickest part , 2 to 3 minutes longer . Flip fillets , skin-side up , onto 4 warmed dinner_plates . Add green_onions and ginger root to skillet and cook , stirring , over medium heat until tender , about 1 minute . Add soy_sauce , sake and red_pepper flakes . Cook and stir until hot , about 30 seconds longer . Pour sauce over trout fillets and serve immediately . Makes 4 servings . * Stuffed trout recipes may be a dime a dozen , but this one stands_out from the crowd with nutty wild_rice and zesty orange . If you like , remove the trout heads and tails before stuffing . TROUT STUFFED WITH WILD_RICE 1 large orange 1 / 2 cup wild_rice Salt , pepper 2 tablespoons butter or margarine 1 / 4 cup chopped onion 1 cup finely diced day-old bread , crusts discarded 1 / 4 cup chopped parsley 2 to 3 tablespoons reduced-sodium chicken_broth or water 4 ( 3 / 4 pound ) whole cleaned trout Finely grate 2 teaspoons zest from orange and reserve .

Cover and simmer over low heat until tender to bite , about 40 minutes . Carefully drain off any remaining liquid . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Heat 1 tablespoon butter in medium skillet . Add onion and cook , stirring , until tender , 2 to 3 minutes . Stir in bread and parsley . Saute another 3 minutes , then remove skillet from heat .

Season to taste inside and out with salt and pepper . Spoon 1 / 4 of stuffing into each trout . Place trout in lightly buttered baking dish and brush fish with remaining 1 tablespoon butter . Bake at 350 degrees until fish are opaque through thickest part ( just behind head ) , 18 to 20 minutes . Transfer to warmed dinner_plates and serve immediately . Makes 4 servings . * This recipe takes_advantage of trout ' s versatility . Poached fillets are paired with crisp greens , toasted pine_nuts and sun-dried tomato dressing . Any seasonal vegetables can be added . Slivered almonds can take the place of pine_nuts .
