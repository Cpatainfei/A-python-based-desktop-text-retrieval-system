   <HEADLINE> EUROPEANS ALL HOT AND BOTHERED BY UNUSUAL WEATHER ; HEAT_WAVE : FARMERS FRET ABOUT CROPS , AND BEER SALES ARE UP . NORTHERN ASIA IS ALSO BAKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Usually , when people complain about the weather in this part of the world , they run_on about gray skies , chills and a winter that never seems to end . But now that much of Europe -- as well as northern Asia -- is in the midst of the worst heat_wave in modern times , everybody from Korean rice farmers to Polish clergy are complaining about too_much sun , too_much heat , not enough rain . The only ones not longing for the gloomy days of winter , it seems , are German vintners : The blazing sun has made the grape crop here ripen so fast that the harvest will be four weeks early . &quot; This is the best it ' s been for grapes in southwestern Germany in many years , &quot; said Norbert Schindler , president of the Vintners ' Assn . for the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate . &quot; This will be the vintage of the century , just like 1976. &quot; Germany nearly broke its national record of 104.4 degrees last month when the temperature hit 103.8 in the eastern town of Preschen . This summer , Britain has racked_up a record 197 hours of sun , sans rain . Tokyo set a new high of 102 degrees on Wednesday , while seven other Japanese cities posted records of_their_own . On Friday , an unmanned measuring station in the Japanese city of Tenryu noted a temperature of 105 degrees . In Europe , the results of all this heat and light have included melting roads and railroad_tracks , the fainting of 40 guests at a Buckingham Palace garden_party , an increase in deaths by drowning and a continent-wide shortage of electric_fans . &quot; You won ' t find one in all_of Europe , &quot; said one fan company executive . In Japan , air-conditioner sales tripled in July , and some store inventories have been wiped_out . Japanese beer sales are up 20 % . In Sweden , psychologist Curt Johanssen said it ' s too hot to think straight and warned , &quot; In temperatures above 81 degrees , it ' s difficult to concentrate_on anything. &quot; Fittingly , in Berlin , employees of the Amerika Gedenk Bibliothek , a library , are being given hitzefrei -- special time_off for heat relief , a privilege usually enjoyed only by children . In Poland , soldiers who marched in recent ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising , wearing heavy uniforms and leather gloves , dropped like a row of dominoes . This so alarmed Cardinal Josef Glemp , who was officiating at an outdoor Mass for the occasion , that he took the unusual steps of letting men wear hats and encouraging the faithful to remain seated during the reading of the Gospel . Also in Poland , and in the Czech Republic , trains are being run at just 37 m.p.h. between noon and 8 p.m. -- after officials noticed that tracks were bending in the heat when trains passed_over them at higher speeds . In Denmark , shoppers are being told to take thermometers to the supermarket to ensure that store refrigerators are keeping food fresh . And Danish social_workers are blaming the heat_wave for a 30 % increase in children being left_behind in bars by drunken parents . In Brugge , Belgium , male inmates have complained that female prisoners are compounding their 87.9-degree heat-induced misery by sunbathing topless . German prisoners haven ' t had anything quite so interesting to complain about : Prison officials in this country have offered inmates relief in the form of unlimited tea and drinking_water ; in Saarbruecken , prisoners are being allowed to have the food-tray slots in their cell doors left open longer than usual , just so some air can blow in . About 15 # 000 Scandinavians have canceled vacations to Greece this summer , apparently because the North and Baltic_seas are warm enough for bathing . Normally , the Baltic is so chilly that swimmers are known to wear bodysuits even in August ; this summer , the water has risen to 73 degrees , and resulting algae blooms are making some swimmers break_out in a rash . Water_levels in Central European lakes and reservoirs are still comfortably high , thanks to heavy spring rains . But the level of the important Elbe_River has plunged , causing many ships to get stuck_on their way from the Czech Republic to the North_Sea . And Japan -- which scientists say is caught in the same circular belt of warm air as Northern_Europe -- is experiencing such severe water shortages that 235 cities and towns have begun rationing . Tokyo ' s supply has been cut by 10 % . In Europe , water temperatures in lakes and rivers have risen so high that scientists say many species of freshwater_fish are at risk . Already , the Rhine is 78.8 degrees . &quot; that ' s extremely high , &quot; said Paul Hagel , vice director of the Dutch Fishery Institute . &quot; With temperatures over ( 86 ) degrees , most types of fish die in our bodies_of_water . The normal temperature for this time_of_year would be around ( 68 ) degrees. &quot; Officials in southern Poland have reported large_numbers of dead fish in rivers flowing_from the Carpathian Mountains ; fish farm_workers have had to destroy seven tons of trout at just one overheated northern German lake . To limit such fish kills , German utilities have been shutting_down generating stations ; otherwise , their coolant water would make the warm rivers even hotter . In the_Netherlands earlier this week , power_companies called_on citizens to use as little electricity as possible from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. But locals didn ' t change their habits , so now the power_plant in Rijswijk , near The Hague , has issued a threat : If customers don ' t cut energy consumption by Monday , the utility will turn_off the power for one district each day . The heat in Europe and Asia is creating havoc for farmers . Apples and plums are already falling_off trees , even though they aren ' t yet ripe . Potato and corn crops are stunted . Sugar_beets have collapsed . In South_Korea , rice_paddies have dried_up and drought has become such a political issue that President Kim Young Sam recently appeared on television passing_out buckets of water and spraying a parched rice_paddy . Times staff writers Sam Jameson in Tokyo , Scott Kraft in Paris , Dean E . Murphy in Warsaw , William Tuohy in London , Carol J . Williams in Ancona , Italy , and special correspondent Janet Stobart in Rome contributed to this report .</TEXT>
