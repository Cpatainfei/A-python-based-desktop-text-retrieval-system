   <HEADLINE> TEAMSTERS TRAVELING A ROUGH , NARROW ROAD ; TRUCKING : ONE OF DEREGULATION ' S EFFECTS ON THE UNION IS 30 # 000 INDEPENDENT CARRIERS THAT ARE TAKING AWAY BUSINESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A lot has happened in the trucking_industry since Life magazine warned its readers in the spring of 1959 that if Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa wanted to , he could &quot; bring a major portion of U.S. transportation -- and thus the entire economy -- to a halt. &quot; With almost 90 % of the nation ' s intercity trucks operating under Teamster contracts 35 years ago , the 1.6 million-member union had the power to choke_off freight shipments almost anywhere . Not anymore . Hoffa is gone , no one is quite sure where , and the union is now in the hands of reformers struggling to overcome his legacy . But more important for those Teamsters -- less than 10 % of the membership -- who earn their living behind the wheel , the trucking_industry has been deregulated . As in the case of airline deregulation , the end of government restrictions on trucking competition in 1980 has been devastating for the union . The Teamsters have lost more_than 100 # 000 members in the industry and the shrinkage continues . Since the end of regulation more_than 30 # 000 independent carriers have swelled the competitive ranks of the industry . When Teamster President Ron Carey called a strike at midnight Tuesday against the 22 companies covered by the union ' s national master freight agreement , the public hardly noticed . The master freight agreement covers what are known in the industry as &quot; less-than-truckload &quot; shipments , those weighing less than 10 # 000 pounds . Most of the shipments are parts used in manufacturing and other non-perishable raw_materials . The union has $ 15 million in its strike fund , which pays benefits of $ 200 a week , and has secured lines_of_credit for $ 80 million from the AFL-CIO and the Union Labor Life_Insurance Co . Like unions in the airline , auto , steel and other industries , the Teamsters face the prospect of fewer jobs and a lower standard_of_living because of competition . In the past , when the Interstate Commerce Commission determined routes , a trucking_company did not have to fear cheaper competition entering its area . Today , in a parallel to the airline industry , the unionized segment of the trucking_industry is being overpowered by competition from small , non-union carriers unburdened by the work rules that can weigh_down a labor_contract .</TEXT>
