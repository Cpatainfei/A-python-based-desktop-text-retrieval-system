   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; END OF U.S. ARMS EMBARGO ADDS TO BOSNIA CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the three short days since the United States broke ranks with European allies and gave_up enforcing a U.N. arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina , the Balkan conflict has dramatically escalated and the peace process has all but collapsed . The abandonment of an embargo the U.S._government did not believe_in may have been intended as a symbolic action to conform with an edict from the U.S. Congress . But that policy shift , combined with more openly expressed U.S. sympathies for the Bosnian and Croatian governments and with recent battlefield successes by Bosnia ' s beleaguered Muslim-led army , has provided the back draft to inflame the Balkan conflict and widen the gap between Washington and its European allies . At a meeting of European defense officials in the Dutch town of Noordwijk , concerned allies dispatched NATO Secretary_General Willy Claes to Washington for emergency talks Wednesday concerning the widening differences within the alliance . France and Spain have warned that they may have to pull_out their Bosnia-based peacekeepers if more arms get_through as a consequence of the U.S. decision to no longer take_part in a naval_blockade along the Adriatic_Sea coast . Bosnian Serb rebels expressed their anger over the latest political and military setbacks by attacking the hotel in Sarajevo , Bosnia ' s capital , that houses the U.S. Embassy and by blasting their way back into territory around the city of Bihac , scene of the first major victory scored by the Muslim-led Bosnian government in 32 months . Croatian Serbs have joined the assault now threatening to vanquish the surrounded Bihac pocket -- a move that would unleash a refugee crisis of proportions yet unseen in four years of Balkan turmoil and rekindle the war between Serbs and Croats that has been simmering beneath a U.N.-imposed cease-fire . Fearful of a catastrophic influx of refugees from teetering Bihac , the Croatian government has been contemplating military recourse to quell Serbs in the breakaway Krajina area , and a renegade Muslim group has also been conscripted for the intensifying showdown over Bihac . &quot; We ' re very worried the conflict in Bihac could spill_over the borders and lead to something unpredictable , &quot; said a U.N. official . &quot; This could be the worst-case scenario for the whole region. &quot; The White_House decision to cease enforcing what was already a leaky embargo has emboldened the Bosnian government in its new and occasionally successful &quot; octopus strategy &quot; of waging numerous niggling offensives on widely scattered Serbian targets in_order to tie_down the heavily armed but demoralized rebel army . By abandoning the embargo and entering into limited defense pacts with Croatia and Bosnia at this crucial moment , the U.S. Administration has also sent signals of support to the governments struggling to contend with Serbian occupation of their territory . But the green_light perceived by Sarajevo leaders for recovering land in the same way they lost_it -- by force of arms -- could backfire on the government troops , as seen in the Bihac region over the weekend . Bosnian Serb forces have recaptured virtually all_of the territory around Bihac lost to the government offensive two weeks ago , said U.N. spokesman Thant Myint-U . Western diplomats here in the Croatian capital also cite intelligence sources as indicating that as_many as 5 # 000 Bosnian Muslims loyal to deposed warlord Fikret Abdic have been moved toward the Bihac front_lines from a refugee camp in the no-man ' s-land sandwiched between rebel Serbs and Croatian government forces . Those fighting-age men , some already defeated by the Bosnian army when it quelled Abdic ' s revolt in August , join what the Zagreb government claims are at least 2 # 500 paramilitary Serb troops from Krajina already fighting in neighboring Bosnia . Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic appealed_to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman over the weekend to &quot; take all necessary steps &quot; to prevent the Krajina Serbs from attacking Bosnian territory -- an overture for collaboration being presented by the Croatian media in an unusually sympathetic light . &quot; What worries me is that the Croatian media have been preparing the public for any military_action that might be contemplated , &quot; said one Western diplomat here . U.N. officials confirmed that the Serbian onslaught continued Monday , and Bosnia ' s U.N. ambassador , Muhamed Sacirbey , claimed that four rockets were fired on the town of Cazin , near Bihac , from Croatian territory . &quot; We ' re very concerned about any possibility that a military solution might be pursued by the Croatian government , &quot; said Thant , the spokesman at U.N. Protection Force headquarters here . In an effort to avert a suddenly looming crisis , the U.S. ambassador to Croatia , Peter Galbraith , has been counseling caution and urging Zagreb to seek a peaceful resolution . But Galbraith has also put Croatia ' s rebel Serbs on notice that they are risking self-destruction if they continue to wage war across an internationally recognized border . &quot; By being involved in Bosnia , the Krajina Serbs are not only jeopardizing the peace process , they are jeopardizing their own position , &quot; Galbraith said . Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic hinted in a letter to U.N. officials at the &quot; military option &quot; his government is under pressure to take_in the face of the concerted Serbian attacks on Bihac . The fall of Bihac , pledged by Bosnian Serb nationalist Radovan Karadzic , would inundate Croatia with as_many as 200 # 000 more refugees and create such a huge and contiguous mass of Serb-held territory as_to make_it impossible for either Croatia or Bosnia ever to recover their Serb-conquered lands . &quot; It would be utterly untenable for Croatia to have the Bihac pocket fall , &quot; a Western envoy said in assessing the likelihood of a preemptive Croatian offensive . During an emergency session at U.N. headquarters in New York on Sunday , the Security_Council denounced the Serbian onslaught and warned the Krajina rebels against further intervention in the Bosnian war . Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic , during a visit to London , characterized the Security_Council statement as &quot; meaningless &quot; and called_for NATO to spare civilian lives in Bihac by taking serious action to protect what has been designated a U.N.-protected &quot; safe haven. &quot; As the fighting has intensified , diplomatic efforts to resolve the Bosnian crisis have reached what even U.N. mediators admit is an impasse . A resumption of long-stalled talks between Zagreb and rebel Serbs was scheduled for today , but mediators were likewise pessimistic that any negotiated breakthrough can be achieved amid the escalated fighting .</TEXT>
