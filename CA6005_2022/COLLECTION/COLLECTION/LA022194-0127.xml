   <TEXT> If there ' s one thing Norwegians go as nuts about as cross-country_skiing , it ' s ski_jumping . It ' s also Nordic , natch . The Olympic airborne troops leaped off the big hill here Sunday and they had a big crowd to appreciate their efforts . Big -- 40 # 000 were there -- and up for it . The local favorite , Espen Bredesen , was the gold-medal favorite and had the crowd excited to begin with , and about half the folks there , even those with seats , never sat . Bredesen was outjumped and had to settle for silver -- he said he was pleased and proud to have it -- but it really made little difference to the faithful assembled . They had a great time . They did the wave -- you haven ' t lived if you haven ' t seen the wave done with thousands of Norwegian flags -- they bopped to a hot jazz_band , they cringed audibly when jumpers Randy Weber and Staffan Taellberg crashed after landing , they yodeled when Austrian Andreas Goldberger got_off a good jump and they clanged their cowbells for no particular reason at all . And why not ? It was a beautiful , sunshine-bright winter day begging to be enjoyed . Cold , of course , but not unbearably so if you were dressed properly -- and had a buffer of some kind to put between your feet or fanny and the snow , which has been collecting in the stadium since winter began sometime last fall . The setting couldn ' t have been more beautiful . You could look_up the_hill at the double-barreled ski slides and watch skiers ' efforts to defy gravity , then turn slightly and know that humans are always going_to come_off second_best in any contest with nature . Nothing manufactured will ever match the pristine beauty of the Norwegian countryside in its winter cloak , and it ' s all there for the looking . Just peek behind the Olympic flame and there it is , as far as the eye can see . As for the competition , Norwegian jumpers drew the biggest cheers , of course , but , just as at the cross-country course , the talents of all_the competitors were applauded and good jumps drew enthusiastic response even if it meant Norge would not carry this particular day . that ' s one of the nice things about this country . Second place isn ' t viewed_as some kind of horrid disgrace . And a day in the sunshine can be its own reward . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
