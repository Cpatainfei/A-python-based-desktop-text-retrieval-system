   <HEADLINE> JUDGE REFUSES TO RECONSIDER LIGHT PENALTY ; COURTS : JURIST WHO SAYS SENTENCING RULES ARE TOO RIGID GAVE A REFORMED DRUG DEALER ONLY HALF THE TERM PROSECUTORS AGREED TO IN A PLEA BARGAIN . HIS ACTIONS MAY LEAD TO A CONFRONTATION WITH FEDERAL_OFFICIALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Escalating his campaign against federal sentencing laws , U.S. District Judge Terry J . Hatter Jr . on Monday refused a request to reconsider the 4 1 / 2-year prison_term he gave to a onetime narcotics dealer who has become a community activist in Pacoima . The U.S. attorney ' s office had asked Hatter to review the sentence because it was half the time defendant Bobbie Marshall had agreed to serve in a plea bargain . Hatter ' s refusal , inviting a confrontation with the executive_branch of government , is one of several instances in which he has challenged federal sentencing laws , which he considers too rigid . He told Atty . Gen . Janet Reno in a public forum last year that young , white federal prosecutors were making their reputations on the backs of minority defendants , comments that angered many federal prosecutors . When Hatter sentenced Marshall earlier this month , the judge said he thought even 4 1 / 2 years was too severe under the circumstances . Hatter praised Marshall , 41 , for turning his life around during the past four years and emerging as an anti-drug , anti-violence advocate who played a key role in the city ' s efforts to maintain calm after verdicts in the second Rodney G . King beating trial and the Reginald O . Denny beating trial . &quot; You have done wonders in the community , &quot; Hatter said , crediting Marshall with helping young_men from minority groups avoid the &quot; spiral of crime in which you found yourself. &quot; He lamented that &quot; justice can ' t be completely done &quot; because politicians have restricted the power of judges to act independently . Hatter was referring to the fact that federal sentencing laws passed in the 1980s restricted the discretion of judges to tailor sentences to fit individual circumstances . Congress enacted the laws after expressing concern that there was too_much inconsistency in sentences given to individuals who had committed similar crimes . At the March 7 sentencing hearing , Hatter also took the rare step of expressing the hope that the government would not appeal the sentence . On Monday , Assistant U.S. Atty . Steven G . Madison , treading as lightly as he could , told Hatter that the government respectfully disagreed_with his decision . Madison said that Hatter was obliged , under a federal appeals court ruling , to impose the &quot; agreed upon nine-year sentence , &quot; which was part of a plea agreement that included the dropping of four other 1989 drug charges . Otherwise , Madison contended , the entire agreement should be voided and Marshall should go_to trial , where he would face a possible sentence of 24 years or more . But Hatter would not budge , saying such an action would be unfair to Marshall . &quot; It ' s the court , if anyone , who is outside the law , not the defendant , &quot; Hatter said . He also formally dismissed the four remaining charges . Hatter told Madison that if the government wants to challenge his decision , the appropriate action for the U.S. attorney ' s office is to follow its normal procedure and ask the U.S. solicitor_general for permission to file an appeal . &quot; Then we ' ll see whether this Justice_Department is ( as rigid ) as the one we had the last 12 years &quot; under Presidents Reagan and Bush , Hatter said . Madison said the government ' s decision to hold_fast for the nine-year term had been made after he consulted with U.S. Atty . Nora Manella and Richard Drooyan , the chief of the office ' s criminal division . The prosecutor said he would consult with them again on whether to appeal Hatter ' s decision . &quot; The U.S. attorney ' s office took a close look_at this case , &quot; Manella said . &quot; We worked_out an agreement that was suitable to both sides and faithful to the sentencing guidelines . We will have to look_at this ( Hatter ' s decision ) and see what our alternatives are. &quot; Manella and Madison noted that this is an unusual case . Marshall was arrested in May , 1989 , and charged with dealing drugs near a Pacoima schoolyard under a special federal statute that mandates stiff prison_terms for such crimes . Marshall had three state convictions between 1977 and 1987 for selling marijuana and for possessing PCP and crack cocaine for_sale . A few months later , Marshall , who is African American , and several other defendants filed papers alleging that the U.S. attorney ' s office was selectively prosecuting blacks and Latinos under the schoolyard law . Two years later , Marshall and three other minority defendants pleaded guilty on the eve of a hearing at which a bevy of local and federal law_enforcement officials , including Robert C . Bonner Jr. , then chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration , were scheduled to testify on the allegations of selective prosecution . Marshall , who had been out on bail since March , 1990 , received a 14-year term . By that time , he was involved in community service work and consistently tested drug-free . Hatter postponed his sentencing for months . Last July , Marshall ' s defense_lawyer , Denise Meyer , sent a letter to Reno urging her to reconsider the 14-year sentence , praising Marshall as a &quot; model of rehabilitation and leadership that the criminal justice system rarely sees and should reward. &quot; Attached_to Meyer ' s letter were other letters of praise from community leaders , including one from Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) . The U.S. attorney ' s office and Meyer renegotiated Marshall ' s plea arrangement and on the morning of March 7 agreed to a nine-year term , setting the stage for Hatter ' s decision to hand_down a more lenient sentence . &quot; We ' re very happy that the judge recognized he has the power to sentence and not the prosecutor , &quot; Meyer said after Monday ' s hearing . &quot; Even though it was a binding plea agreement , it doesn ' t mean that the judge doesn ' t retain jurisdiction to decide on a fair and just sentence. &quot; Hatter ' s decision in the Marshall case is not the first time he has imposed a sentence lighter than prosecutors sought . But he also has meted_out severe sentences in narcotics cases . In 1991 , he sentenced two men to life terms , without possibility of parole , after they were convicted of being the leaders of a ring that was broken_with the seizure of a record 21.4 tons of cocaine in a Sylmar warehouse . &quot; This is a case that cries_out_for the maximum sentence , &quot; Hatter said . &quot; Society must be protected as best it can. &quot;</TEXT>
