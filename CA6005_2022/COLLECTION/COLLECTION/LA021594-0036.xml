   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; THE WELFARE COSTS THAT ARE DRAGGING DOWN...EUROPE ; THE CONTINENT ' S ' GOOD LIFE ' IS GETTING TOO EXPENSIVE , TOUCHING OFF PROTESTS AND STRIKES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Life is good for Myriam Gerard , Alain Dubois and their little family . With two incomes , they net $ 3 # 500 every month , own their own home_in the city that calls itself the capital of Europe and enjoy the benefits of Belgium ' s liberal welfare democracy -- the 13th-month salary ( an extra month ' s pay each year ) , the 14th-month salary ( a second extra month ' s salary each year minus 15 % ) , automatic inflation-indexed pay increases , a company car , free gasoline , a gift from the state of $ 850 for the birth of each child , subsequent child benefits , food_stamps and , of course , six weeks annual vacation , heavily subsidized medical_care and the security of a generous state pension . Fifty miles west of the Gerard-Dubois home , in the small Flemish town of Lembeke , Karel Boone finds the going tougher . He struggles to keep his family-owned cookie business from sinking under wage costs that he says have gone_out of control . &quot; If this doesn ' t change , there ' s going_to be a catastrophe in our country , &quot; he said . Back in Brussels , Jan Smets , who heads the Belgian government ' s Cabinet office , sits in a room a_few doors down from Prime_Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene and mulls the problem of how to rein_in a national_debt that in relative terms is already more_than twice that of the United States and growing fast . The Gerard-Dubois benefits , Boone ' s struggle and Smets ' dilemma are all part of a painful reality that has spread far beyond the borders of this tidy little nation to afflict virtually all_the democracies of Western Europe : The tax-supported welfare_states that have anchored the region since World_War_II can no longer be sustained . That realization is making political waves that have washed into the streets . While the deepest recession in decades has played its part , the crisis that grips Western Europe ' s social_democracies goes_far deeper than any economic downturn . Instead , the difficulties lie_in the worrisome structure of the welfare_state and intractable problems such_as rapidly aging populations , a large and growing army of long-term , hard-core unemployed and spiraling health_care costs . All have increasingly sucked_up resources , driving the welfare bill to untenable levels . Traditional sources of funding such_as payroll taxes can no longer bear the load . Wage costs in the region have gone so high that they are beginning to price Western Europeans out of competitive world markets . The fall of the Iron_Curtain just over four years ago was the final straw , unleashing a new flow of immigration that has swamped already strained Western welfare systems and placing an array of cheap industrial goods at Western Europe ' s doorstep . &quot; We ' ve reached the top of the flagpole , &quot; former Economics Minister Otto Graf Lambsdorff of Germany warned his country ' s Parliament in a speech last year . He called Germany ' s network of social benefits &quot; too expensive , too inflexible , too static , insufficiently entrepreneurial and dynamic. &quot; Although his comment was directed at Germany , it was valid for the entire region . &quot; We ' ve hit the peak ; we ' re looking_at the downhill side , &quot; Tony Vandeputte , chief_executive_officer of the Federation of Belgian Enterprises , said in an interview . &quot; Even within the trade_unions and elsewhere on the political left , people are aware that dramatic changes are needed. &quot; For Western Europe , the idea of questioning the welfare_state is an emotional process that represents far more_than a discussion on how to resolve an economic_crisis . The debate touches the very foundation on which the Western Europeans have built their post-World War II social order . The region ' s generous welfare systems have not only erased poverty as a social blight , they have provided the glue of social cohesion and stability . And during the postwar decades , these social safety nets have become a part of a collective identity , one that Western Europeans believe sets them apart from industrial societies in America and Asia . ( Belgian official Smets , for example , in trying to explain his country ' s basic commitment to the welfare_state , spoke_of &quot; the very European idea of solidarity. &quot; ) Western Europeans have carved out a_level of affluence that matches that of most Americans , and they have provided_for everyone along the way . That ideal is now cracking under the weight of economic imperatives . The budget cutting has already begun , and the only certainty about the future is that deeper cuts will follow . Some of the most radical rollbacks so far have come_in Sweden -- the nation whose mixture of affluence , welfare and social justice dates_from far earlier in the century . Since taking_office in late 1991 , conservative Prime_Minister Carl Bildt has pushed $ 20 billion in government spending_cuts through the Swedish Parliament , reducing maternity and sick_leave benefits , introducing small fees for medical services and making citizens contribute to their own pensions . More fundamentally , the very value of complete , comprehensive welfare as a social good -- once an unquestioned given -- is undergoing a rethink . A report published last year by the Swedish Ministry of Finance drew a troubling conclusion : &quot; What was considered as a central achievement of the Swedish welfare_state only a_couple_of decades ago is now being evaluated differently . Costs have skyrocketed , while effects on economic_growth . . . have been increasingly detrimental. &quot; * A reduced work ethic characterized by alarmingly high absenteeism , an unemployment_rate that has increased sixfold in five years and the industrialized world ' s highest per capita budget_deficit all helped contribute to this conclusion , as did the country ' s sharply reduced growth over the last two decades . The re-evaluation in Sweden has been an important signal for Europe psychologically , because it served as a model to many of the war-torn nations of Western Europe in the late 1940s and early 1950s as they searched for new vision in a post-fascist era . It was from Sweden , for example , that influential leaders such_as Germany ' s Willy Brandt and Austria ' s Bruno Kreisky carried home new political ideas gathered during their wartime exile there . Today , governments throughout the region are following Sweden again -- this time in the politically unpleasant task of taking_away what they once gave so generously . Predictably , the reaction has been intense . Late last year in Germany , steelworkers demonstrated against the abolition of guaranteed lifetime liberal unemployment benefits . ( A four-year limit was placed on them instead. ) Later , more_than 100 # 000 angry construction workers descended on Bonn to protest a government decision to abolish &quot; bad_weather money &quot; -- a government subsidy established during the late 1950s that effectively pays workers even when weather_conditions shut_down a building_site . Faced with growing budgetary strains , Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s government has cut education support , begun to shift health_care costs onto the consumer and reduced unemployment insurance . It has yet to confront the implications of an aging population on the country ' s welfare system . One in every four Germans will be over 65 by the third decade of the next century , decreasing the economically productive percentage of society . Meanwhile , employers , straining under the costs of benefits they help finance , are telling trade_unions the era of big wage hikes has passed . &quot; The idyllic life is over ; turbulent years are ahead , &quot; the leading German news weekly , Der Spiegel , predicted in its 1993 year-end issue . The picture is similar elsewhere : * In France , since his election last May , Prime_Minister Eduard Balladur has frozen public_service wages , extended the number of working years required to draw a full state pension from 37.5 to 40 years and said he hopes to trim more_than $ 500 million from health_care spending this year . * In Italy , over the next decade , the minimum legal retirement age will be increased by five years to 65 for men and 60 for women as a way of cutting pension costs . But fraud remains rampant , and the government has yet to crack_down on a system that is estimated to dole_out some form of pension to more_than one-third of the population . * In Spain , which embraced the welfare_state wholeheartedly only with the Socialist election victory in the early 1980s , reductions in health_care and jobless benefits triggered a national general strike last month . Many experts believe that the cuts so far represent the beginning , not the end , of a painful , socially sensitive process . * The struggle in Belgium is an example with parallels throughout the region . Despite the fact that 47 % of the country ' s national_income flows into government coffers , it is no longer enough to finance what over the years has become one of Europe ' s most comprehensive welfare systems . For Belgium , the price for this luxury has become the highest national_debt ( in relative terms ) in the industrialized world and a system of financing benefits that many argue has become counterproductive . For example , private-sector employers such_as Boone , the man with the cookie business , claim that the costs of welfare benefits are now so high they have become a disincentive to employ new people . &quot; If I had a new product with a guaranteed market but that product was labor-intensive to make , I would be a fool to launch it here , &quot; Boone said . Even Prime_Minister Dehaene ' s coalition government , which includes a number of Socialist ministers , agrees that wage costs must come_down . Last year , Dehaene launched an austerity program that included a wage_freeze in real terms , a cut_in child benefits , a cap on health_care spending and a retroactive tax surcharge . In an attempt to shift some of the burden of benefits financing away from industry , the government has also agreed to cut business contributions to welfare in half for low-wage employees . It hopes to make_up the difference by increasing indirect_taxes . What industrial leader Vandeputte called &quot; a very cautious beginning &quot; -- and the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development dismissed as wholly inadequate -- was nonetheless viewed_as a disaster by trade_unions . They called Belgium ' s first general strike in 58 years last November to protest and have vowed to continue the fight . Little wonder that other politically sensitive areas , such_as the extremely high civil_service pensions ( 90 % of working salary for the lower-paid employees and 80 % for others ) , remained untouched . &quot; We are going_to live through more and more social unrest , &quot; predicted Robert Voorham , national secretary of the large FGTB trade_union . &quot; The ( economic ) pressures from Central and Eastern Europe have only just begun. &quot; Voorham agreed that wage costs must drop but insisted that the existing welfare net can -- and must -- be preserved by a combination of new indirect_taxes and serious government attempts to cut_down on tax fraud . He argued that trimming the welfare_state at a time of record unemployment would risk new tensions that could rupture the fragile social peace that exists between Belgium ' s 5.5 million Dutch-speaking Flemings and its 4.5 million French-speaking Walloons . &quot; You just can ' t do that here , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s too_much cultural , nationalistic conflict. &quot; * Xavier Mabille , director of the Center for Socio-Political Research and Information here , went_further , claiming that repeated government calls_for more sacrifice run the danger of discrediting the entire political mainstream and driving voters to the extremist right . &quot; Europe is becoming a powder_keg , &quot; he said . &quot; The fires have already started in some places. &quot; But not all are so pessimistic . Indeed , in Denmark , the government has found a new source for financing its expensive welfare system : exporting its expertise . So far , revenues are admittedly modest , but the Danish Social_Affairs Ministry has formed a company called Exsos ( Export of Social_Systems ) and landed contracts_in eastern Germany for setting_up retirement homes for the elderly and in Estonia to assist in building that country ' s first social_security program . &quot; We ' re not exporting the level of our welfare--we ' re selling our know-how , &quot; stressed Leif Lytken , the ministry ' s chief consultant on the venture . &quot; There ' s a lot of good opportunities out there. &quot; Tallying Up the Welfare_State The Employer Gross salary is just part of an employer ' s cost in Western Europe . Karel Boone , DEO of Corona-Lotus , a medium-sized producer of cakes and cookies in Belgium , provided this braeakdown for an average employee , using the salary as an index equal_to q100 : Gross salary : 100 Annual bonus : 11 Social_security : 50 Vacation pay : 12 Sick_pay : 9 Insurance : 3 Misc. : 6 Total cost to employer : 191 * The Employees Educator Myriam Gerard a research manager Alain Dubois , a two-income Belgian family , pay a hefty portion of their income to the government , but they get quite a_few benefits , too , from both the government and their employers . Here ' s a monthly rundown : INCOME Combined joint net monthly income : $ 3 # 508.82. TAXES Combined monthly income_tax and social_security contributions : $ 2 # 438.00 BENEFITS * Additional , year-end , so-called 13th month salary , valued per month : $ 241.67 * Additional vacation bonus , so-called 14th month salary , valued per month : $ 233.92 * Subsidized car and gasoline : $ 588.00 * Child benefits paid by employer : $ 88.23 * State child benefits : $ 147.05 * Employer-paid pension contributions : $ 164.71 TOTAL BENEFITS : $ 1 # 463.58 Europe ' s Economic Malaise Burdensome Debt Most of Western Europe ' s social_democracies are rolling_up huge public_debts , in large part caused by costly welfare programs . The United States and Japan also have substantial public_debt . * Accumulated public_debt as a percentage of gross_national_product .
