   <HEADLINE> IN POST-COLD WAR ERA , IT ' S FREE_WORLD that ' s SHIFTING ; DIPLOMACY : RELATIONSHIPS THAT WERE ALLIANCES OF CONVENIENCE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE SOVIET_UNION ARE NOW BEING RE-EVALUATED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the Cold_War ended and the Berlin Wall came_down , many people looked_for huge political changes in Eastern Europe and expected that the rest of the world -- what we used to call the Free_World during the Cold_War -- would stay pretty much unchanged . It hasn ' t worked_out that way , and there are important lessons here for the United States to learn . In Eastern Europe the communists , ex- and not-very-ex , are_on a roll . A string of election victories and near-victories has put heirs of Josef Stalin ' s parties in or near power in half-a-dozen countries in Eastern Europe . In East_Germany , the ex-communists pushed Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s Christian Democrats into third place in the most recent local elections . Meanwhile , the winds of change are blowing -- through the West . In Japan , 40 years of power by the ( misnamed ) Liberal Democratic Party ended last summer and the Social Democratic Party of Japan , a party long opposed to Japan ' s role in the U.S. system of Cold_War alliances , is now the largest bloc in a new government . In Italy , the heirs of the Italian Communist_Party are now the most powerful political force in a disintegrating political structure . Their strongest rivals are a party that wants Italy to break_up and a neo-fascist movement that ran Benito Mussolini ' s granddaughter for mayor of Naples . The people U.S. policy tried to exclude from Italian politics look set to control the next stage in Italy ' s evolution . The Sandinistas are , in_effect , part of the governing coalition in Nicaragua ; the current president of South_Korea was a dissident during the Cold_War ; a socialist jailed by America ' s military allies is the front-runner for the next presidential election in Brazil ; the Palestine Liberation Organization and the African National Congress , both denounced by Cold-War American leaders as terrorist organizations with communist links , now look_like governments-in-waiting . None of this was in the script . The Cold_War was supposed to be a battle between the United States and the Free_World against the Soviet_Union and the Slave World . Our allies , we kept telling ourselves , were members of the Free_World ; their allies were satellites and puppets . Fidel Castro was a puppet of Moscow , while El_Salvador ' s murdering oligarchy was &quot; making progress toward democracy. &quot; But life is never as simple as political rhetoric would have it . In some countries , U.S. allies were genuine democrats ; in others they were , well , puppets and satellites . The shah , Manuel A . Noriega before he bit the hand that fed him -- we can all add names to the list . In many countries the lines between satellite and genuine national democracy were blurred . Italy ' s Christian Democrats and their allies were genuine local movements that had close ties to the CIA and the U.S._government at various points in their history . During most of the Cold_War , governments in West Germany and Japan considered themselves dependent_on the American &quot; big_brother &quot; who had defeated them in World_War_II and now protected them from the Soviet_Union . U.S. alliances in the Cold_War were not always alliances with entire countries ; sometimes they were just with a regime or one political_party . This was particularly obvious in countries like Greece , South_Korea , South Vietnam , Nicaragua , El_Salvador and Taiwan . In all these countries , the U.S._government supported one side in a civil_war , and communists supported the other . In other countries the Americans did not need to be so heavy handed , but their influence was still felt . Both the United States and the Soviet_Union interfered in the internal affairs of other countries throughout the Cold_War ; both infiltrated political_parties , sent financial assistance to friendly political factions and generally did their best to control the outcome of political processes . Now both sets of foreign influences are being withdrawn , and countries are trying to find a new political balance based on the strengths of their internal political forces . Communist_parties in the Western world have been deprived of financial_support and liberated from the ideological connection to Moscow . Pro-Western parties are also forced to get_by on_their_own . The changes will not be trivial . Greece , an honorary part of the West during the Cold_War , is beginning to look and act more like a Balkan country than a Western European one . Germany and Japan must now decide whether they wish to belong_to the Western world or not . During the Cold_War , they had little choice -- the alliance with the United States was both welcome and necessary . Now they must choose for themselves . All this suggests a new interpretation of America ' s victory in the Cold_War . Conventional wisdom originally assumed that the United States won the Cold_War the way we won World_War_II : The end of the conflict left the America unchallenged in the world . What was true of the United States was true of our principles : Free markets and free political institutions were about to sweep the globe . We wish . The United States does not bestride the world like an invincible colossus . Soviet_Union or no Soviet_Union , the United States cannot impose its will on Somalia or even on Haiti . Our Cold_War allies can , when they wish , thumb their noses at us with impunity . Over Bosnia and on trade issues , the Western allies demonstrated an independence that would have been unthinkable at the height of the Cold_War . Americans will have a clearer idea of the international situation if they compare our Cold_War victory to Britain ' s victory in World_War I . Britain was a superpower going_into the war and it remained a superpower coming_out of it ; and Germany , Britain ' s great rival , was decisively defeated . For a_few years after the war , the_British behaved like an unchallenged superpower . They sent troops to trouble spots around the world ; they bombed Iraq into submission . But the_British soon found that they were overextended . They were helpless to establish democracy in Russia or to prevent ethnic cleansing in the Balkans . In the end , they gave_up the effort to establish world order , retreated to relative isolationism and ignored the dangers posed by the rise of fascism in Europe . These mistakes would be easy for the United States to repeat . Overconfidence has already led us to commit ourselves too often and too far overseas ; we may be_on the verge of an equally excessive retreat into misguided isolation . In the rapidly changing world , the United States needs a realistic sense both of its powers and its limits in foreign_policy . The &quot; Free_World &quot; is changing as fast as the Communist World as the ' 90s roll on ; our ex-enemies aren ' t changing as much as we hoped and our old friends are changing in ways we can ' t always predict and often don ' t like . The world is a far more complicated place now than during the Cold_War -- and it gets more complex every day . The Clinton_Administration will need all_the skill and luck_it can get_to find its way through the pitfalls and land_mines so thickly scattered across the post-Cold War international landscape .</TEXT>
