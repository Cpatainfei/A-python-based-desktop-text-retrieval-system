   <TEXT> Ken , 17 , believed he had no choice but to belch loudly during a &quot; mushy &quot; classroom discussion on betrayed love , as depicted in Nathaniel Hawthorne ' s &quot; The Scarlet Letter. &quot; &quot; I had to do something ' cause I was starting to freak , &quot; said Ken , remembering the &quot; dumb day &quot; last year in an English_class at a Westside high_school . &quot; All that talk_about love and feelings and commitment makes me feel weird , like I ' m talking_about something private . . . . that ' s why I feel_like I had to interrupt. &quot; Despite the teacher ' s public reprimand , detention and ultimately a bad grade , Ken said the burp was worth it . &quot; School don ' t do me much good anyway. &quot; Ken ' s attitude worries some educators , counselors and academics , who believe it illustrates the sorry state of boys in the classroom . Neglect and unfair treatment , they say , damage the education of boys in elementary and secondary_schools in California and nationwide . Two reports , released by the American Assn . of University Women in 1991 and 1992 , have produced countless discussions and media stories about classroom bias against female students and the plummeting of teen-age girls ' self-esteem . And while few will completely dismiss girls ' struggles , a handful of experts and forthcoming books argue that in recent years , girls have received too_much attention and boys not enough . &quot; Boys are believed to have the educational opportunities &quot; at the expense of girls , said Diane Ravitch , former assistant secretary_of_education and a senior research scholar at New York University . &quot; But many boys -- boys of all ( ethnic and economic ) backgrounds -- are angry and in_trouble . Not many have connected this to the facts. &quot; Facts , according to Ravitch and the U.S. Department_of_Education , such_as : more adult men than women lack a high_school diploma ; young_men have lower educational aspirations ; boys consistently earn lower report_card grades ; they get_in more trouble at school . Young_men also bring into the classroom emotional problems from outside the school fences , stemming from being what some have called &quot; an endangered species. &quot; Recent U.S. Department_of_Justice figures , for example , reveal that high_school boys are four times more likely than girls to be murdered ; they are more prone to abuse alcohol or drugs ; boys 12 to 15 run double the risk faced by girls of becoming victims of a violent crime , and 82 % of the nation ' s incarcerated youths 18 and under are male -- a percentage that increases to an estimated 95 % for adult men . &quot; Obviously , this hurts boys ' academic performance and chance for success in life , &quot; said Thomas Glennon , a psychologist in Studio City and a consultant for a North Hollywood center for troubled youths . &quot; I see many boys who have such a low self-esteem and tremendous amounts of anger . A lot can ' t handle life. &quot; Statistics from the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention show that male California youths , ages 15 to 24 , are four times more likely to commit suicide than girls in the same age_group . But teen-age girls unsuccessfully attempt suicide about as often as teen-age boys , CDC epidemiologist Robin Ikeda said . &quot; Boys have everything stacked against them , &quot; said Lawrence Beymer , a counseling professor at Indiana State University and author of &quot; Meeting the Guidance and Counseling Needs of Boys , &quot; published by the American Counseling Assn . in September . &quot; The schools don ' t seem to notice . Everyone always seems to talk_about the poor little_girls with low self-esteem . Well that ' s screwy. &quot; What ' s even more discouraging , said Larry Schryver , is that most people acknowledge boys ' problems only when they are tied to their ethnicity , such_as the high homicide rate among young African American men . Schryver is director of Camp Afflerbaugh , a Los Angeles County probation facility in La Verne , which houses about 115 male juvenile offenders between the ages of 16 and 18 . &quot; People tend to view boys ' problems as something that can be solved only with punishment . With girls , there ' s a feeling that they can be rehabilitated , &quot; said Schryver , pointing_out that boys occupy 17 of the county ' s 18 probation centers . &quot; This gives boys the idea that they don ' t matter , that they don ' t exist. &quot; * Ian McCann , 15 , said he feels confident about his personality and academic abilities . But the Fullerton High_School student added : &quot; Many of the guys I see ( in classes ) seem unmotivated , especially in English . They ' re usually timid and unsure of themselves . But the girls I see are very confident and very much able to succeed. &quot; In Woodbridge , Va. , a scheduling quirk placed only boys in Jean Ellerbe ' s ninth-grade English_class last year . &quot; At first , it was a mess , &quot; she said . &quot; They were at-risk students who had reading difficulties and they looked_like the type of boys who got_in trouble. &quot; But then Ellerbe tailored the curriculum to pique the boys ' interest in the Vietnam and Gulf wars . Reading tests given to her 20 students at the beginning and end of the year showed the boys collectively boosting their scores 2.7 grade levels . &quot; I don ' t think they would have been nearly as successful if there were girls &quot; in the class , she said . Neither does Gary White , 16 , one of Ellerbe ' s students . &quot; I like girls , but I don ' t like being in classes with girls , &quot; he said . &quot; Teachers seem to like girls better . Girls are too confident . They ' re always talking in classes . It can get intimidating. &quot; The observations of McCann , Ellerbe and White mirror the findings of a report published in the fall , 1993 , issue of Research in Middle Level Education . A study of 400 sixth- through eighth-graders in North Carolina found that girls have a higher opinion of themselves . &quot; Boys tend to puff themselves up more , &quot; said William Purkey , co-author of the study and a counseling professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro . &quot; Boys brag when they ' re insecure , so it looks_like they ' re more confident than they really are. &quot; Although the report focuses_on a small sample of students from one state , it contradicts the AAUW ' s nationwide poll of 2 # 400 girls and 600 boys in 1991 . That study found that 29 % of the high_school girls compared to 46 % of their male peers agreed they are &quot; happy the way I am. &quot; A year later , the AAUW reported textbooks and teachers favor boys , damaging girls ' self-esteem . AAUW Executive_Director Anne L . Bryant echoed many experts when she said the research &quot; shows that schools seriously shortchange girls . Girls need to have better opportunities and more encouragement. &quot; Others criticize the AAUW reports as self-serving and scientifically flawed . For instance , self-described feminist Christina Hoff Sommers disputed AAUW ' s &quot; deceptive &quot; methodology and &quot; misleading &quot; conclusions in &quot; Who Stole Feminism ? How Women Have Betrayed Women &quot; ( Simon &amp; Schuster , 1994 ) . &quot; ( AAUW reports ) do not reflect reality , &quot; said Clifford Adelman , senior research analyst for the U.S. Department_of_Education . &quot; Females are the greatest success story in American education. &quot; He rattled_off the numbers : Women earn more_than half of all associate , bachelors and masters degrees ; they receive almost half of the doctorates , law and medical degrees ; they are increasingly enrolling at top colleges and universities . The College Board recently reported that female high_school students have increased scores and narrowed the gender gap for the third straight year in the verbal and math sections of the Scholastic Assessment Test . &quot; The issue of gender inequity is not in the schools but in the labor_market , &quot; said Adelman , who is studying the successes and failures of high_school students who graduated in 1982 and 1972 and is chronicling the latter in &quot; Lessons of a Generation &quot; ( Jossey-Bass / Macmillan ) , published this month . Before writing &quot; Failing at Fairness : How America ' s Schools Cheat Girls &quot; ( Charles Scribner ' s Sons , 1994 ) , authors Myra and David Sadker spent years observing classroom interaction at 80 public_schools in four states and the District_of_Columbia . The American University professors concluded that girls fall_behind boys in math and science , and teachers -- the majority of whom are women -- pay more attention to and expect more from boys than girls . Still , in their chapter called &quot; The Miseducation of Boys , &quot; the Sadkers acknowledge problems facing boys . &quot; Much of the attention boys receive is negative attention , &quot; David Sadker said . &quot; Gender bias is a two-edge sword . Boys ' problems don ' t just affect boys . It threatens ( equality ) for everyone. &quot; * Brian Slezak , a 42-year-old father of two teen-age boys in Rowland Heights , said he frets about teachers unfairly punishing boys ' &quot; natural aggressiveness. &quot; While in grade_school , one of his sons had attention_deficit_disorder . &quot; Teachers treated my son , who is outspoken and extremely smart , like he was misbehaving . His mind was just racing , &quot; he recalled . &quot; That can really break a kid ' s spirit . Luckily , my son grew out of it. &quot; Educators and psychologists worry that rowdy behavior exhibited by more boys than girls propels school officials to wrongly place boys in special_education classes . The National Longitudinal Study of Special_Education , conducted by the U.S. Department_of_Education in 1993 , found that boys make_up about two-thirds of the classes for students with learning , behavioral and developmental problems . For the past decade , boys have filled about 90 % of Alice Robinson ' s special_education classes . &quot; A lot of the boys suffer because many students in non-special education classes call them stupid , &quot; said Robinson , a former elementary-school teacher for the Los Angeles Unified School District who now teaches in the Bay Area . &quot; It can have a negative long-term effect on the boys . I worry about them. &quot; Ross Shickler , co-principal of Jordan High_School in Long_Beach , said he also worries about boys . Often , &quot; There ' s a hopelessness and disappointment that is weighing_down heavily on boys , causing them to join gangs or drop_out , &quot; he said , citing the 3 # 000-student school ' s 11 % dropout rate of mostly boys . He and Mel Collins , co-principal , are hoping to combat the problem with a new self-esteem program . One hundred juniors and seniors will undergo a four-day training_program designed to teach them coping , confidence-building and peace-making skills , Shickler said . Students will then help their peers . &quot; Something needs to be done , &quot; he said , &quot; especially for the boys. &quot;</TEXT>
