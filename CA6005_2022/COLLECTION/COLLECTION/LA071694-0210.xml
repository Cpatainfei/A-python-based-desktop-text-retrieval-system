   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ALREADY PUSHING HARD FOR 2002 BID ; SOCCER : FORMER ENGLAND PLAYER CHARLTON LENDS SUPPORT . SOUTH_KOREA IS MAIN COMPETITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> World Cup ' 94 has two games left . World Cup ' 98 is only a glimmer in France ' s eye . But don ' t view the 8 a.m. news_conference Friday called by World Cup Japan 2002 as premature . The committee to bring the event to Japan is four years old , has enlisted the former president of Nissan as its chairman and Friday produced two Diet members -- Japanese congressmen -- to sit in silent solidarity with Japanese soccer officials before the world ' s press . The political and industrial clout of the Japanese was_on display because , to some extent , the Japanese , who have never qualified for the event , are behind their primary competition for the 2002 Cup , South_Korea . But , they say , they are gaining_ground quickly . Fifteen Japanese cities -- not including Tokyo -- are already building new stadiums in anticipation of the 2002 World Cup . FIFA wants the tournament in Asia , and when it is awarded in 1996 by FIFA ' s executive committee Japan or South_Korea will get_it . &quot; It ' s Asia ' s time , &quot; said Bobby Charlton , one of two former British soccer players to be knighted and under contract as an adviser to World Cup Japan 2002 . &quot; South_America has had it , now North_America , and Europe again will have it in 1998. &quot; Charlton said Saudi_Arabia might compete for the Cup and that a possible Colombian bid might be in the works . But newcomers to the 2002 race would be hopelessly behind the Asian_nations , and although FIFA eventually wants to see the World Cup in Africa , the growth of the sport in the Far East makes the 2002 competition a two-horse race . &quot; FIFA wants soccer to be the world ' s game , and I think the feeling is that the time is right to go_to Asia , &quot; he said . &quot; After that , the time likely will be right to go_to Africa . &quot; The concern is that it be done right , that Asia put_on a good show . And , certainly , I think the Japanese are most capable of that . &quot; They have the population , they have the finances and they have the ability to mobilize on such a scale. &quot; The Japanese certainly have the bullet trains and airlines to zip from site to site and the communications_systems to handle any press crush imaginable . What they don ' t have is Chung Mong-Joon , the president of the Korean Football Assn . and the recently elected vice_president of FIFA , a position with considerable sway over who gets the Cup and who does not . South_Korea has qualified for the World Cup four times , including the last three . Japan has yet to make_it . And South_Korea is coming_off the glow of the 1988 Olympics , staged without incident in the shadow of a hostile North_Korea . As Chung writes in the bid literature , if Korea gets the Cup , &quot; it will no doubt contribute greatly to reunifying South and North_Korea . . . . This , I believe , will be a way to uphold the spirit of the World Cup. &quot; But as 15 Japanese cities build stadiums , South_Korea is still looking_for 15 cities for what will be a 32-team tournament . Said Charlton : &quot; The number of cities and breadth of ( Japan ) is perfectly suited for the 32-team format . A lot of countries really don ' t have enough major cities to host the event . I would think that would be Korea ' s primary problem. &quot;</TEXT>
