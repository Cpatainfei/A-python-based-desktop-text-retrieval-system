   <HEADLINE> ANOTHER ROSE BOWL LOSS ; UCLA IS BADGERED BY WISCONSIN ' S TICKET-SCALPING REVELATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Speaking just in public-relations terms , it ' s been a tough year for UCLA . Student hunger_strikes . Faculty houses unsold on the West_Side . The flap over Michael Milken ' s lecture contract . Amid all_the negative news , the football_team ' s Rose Bowl appearance was supposed to be an uptick . Guess again . Chancellor Charles E . Young and other UCLA officials are now caught_up in a new mess over Rose Bowl ticket scalping . The controversy grew out of an investigation by the Wisconsin attorney_general , who is trying to determine if charges can be filed against travel_agents who failed to deliver on promised Rose Bowl tickets for several hundred Wisconsin fans who traveled here for the game . In the course of their probe , Wisconsin investigators learned that UCLA , with Young ' s approval , sold a block of 4 # 000 tickets to a single athletic department booster , Angelo Mazzone . He paid the face_value of the tickets and donated an additional $ 100 # 000 to UCLA . In turn , Mazzone sold the tickets to a broker for an undisclosed sum . So far there appears to be nothing illegal about the deal . Reselling tickets is legal in California . And school officials say they agreed to Mazzone ' s offer to avoid financial_losses that UCLA would have faced if large_numbers of tickets had been left unsold . They say they did not anticipate the ticket demand that resulted when Wisconsin , which had not been to the Rose Bowl in 30 years , qualified as the visiting team . Still , this is another PR problem UCLA does not need . It has angered UCLA boosters who were told before the Rose Bowl that they could buy only a limited number of tickets . It revived anger in Wisconsin over hundreds of tourists who came_out here for the game and got ripped_off . And it may yet became a financial problem for the taxpayers who support UCLA . Last week , both the school and UC regents were named as defendants in a class-action lawsuit filed_in Wisconsin on behalf of irate fans who did not get the tickets they paid_for . Some uptick .</TEXT>
