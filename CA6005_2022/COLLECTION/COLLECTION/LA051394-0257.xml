   <HEADLINE> RETAIL SALES , WHOLESALE PRICE DIP CALM INFLATION FEARS ; ECONOMY : NEVERTHELESS , EXPERTS PREDICT THE FED WILL RAISE SHORT-TERM INTEREST_RATES AGAIN SOON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s fears that the nation ' s recovery is threatening to let inflation out of its cage , the Commerce_Department said Thursday that retail sales and wholesale prices fell_in April -- fresh evidence that the economy is growing at a sustainable pace without putting too_much upward pressure on prices . The government reports , which show retail sales dropping a surprising 0.8 % and producer prices dipping 0.1 % , quelled some Wall_Street investors ' concerns about inflation -- at least for the day -- and triggered a rally in the stock and bond markets . The reports were also welcomed by the Clinton_Administration , which said the data reflects an economy that is growing steadily but is in no danger of overheating . But many private analysts said the news probably won ' t be enough to dissuade the Federal_Reserve from raising short-term interest_rates again soon in its controversial effort to prevent inflationary pressures from building . &quot; I still think the Fed is going_to move rates higher soon because it ' s paranoid about inflation , even though there ' s no inflation to be seen , &quot; said Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at financial services giant Norwest Corp . in Minneapolis . The Fed has raised its federal funds rate three times since February in an effort to discourage more borrowing , slow economic_growth and keep inflation in check . Senior board officials recently told The Times that the nation ' s central_bank is poised to raise interest_rates repeatedly in coming months and hinted that the next increase could come within days . Thursday ' s reports showing surprising weakness in retail sales and wholesale prices last month won ' t be enough to make the Fed change its course , analysts said . &quot; The Fed doesn ' t make policy based on one set of numbers , &quot; said David Jones of New York investment_bankers Aubrey G . Lanston &amp; Co. , adding that he thinks the central_bank will again raise short-term rates by the time its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday . While the Fed ' s strategy of raising interest_rates to cool the economy is controversial , the news of the sharp drop_in retail sales would indicate that it is also working . Analysts blamed the unexpected dip on the rise in rates -- a rise that has accelerated since the Fed launched the first of its three rate increases Feb . 4 . &quot; Most consumers cut_back on their spending when interest_rates go_up , and rates have gone_up a lot lately , &quot; said Sohn at Norwest . But despite those rising rates , the 0.1 % drop_in producer prices -- which measures inflation at the wholesale level -- shows that manufacturers are still having trouble raising the prices they charge retailers . In the first four months of the year , producer prices have risen at a 2.7 % annual rate , compared to a 4.4 % rate in the same period a year ago , the Commerce_Department said . Last month ' s core rate_of_inflation -- which excludes the volatile food and energy categories -- rose only 0.1 % . In a third report that indicated the economy ' s growth may be slowing , the Labor_Department said first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose by 26 # 000 to a seasonally adjusted 378 # 000 last week . Economists had predicted claims would fall by about 10 # 000 . Although many analysts said Thursday ' s reports show that the economy is already slowing and that the Fed doesn ' t need to raise interest_rates again , others said inflationary pressures are building even though they haven ' t shown_up on store shelves or at the checkout_counter . For example , prices for oil -- which is used to make literally millions of different products and greatly affects companies ' manufacturing and distribution_costs -- have surged over the last few weeks due_to production problems in the North_Sea and civil unrest in Yemen .
