   <HEADLINE> WILSON TO SMOKE : GET LOST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an election year , when politicians can do odd things , Gov . Pete Wilson did the right thing Thursday by signing a bill that gives Californians the best protection from unwanted smoke of all Americans . The bill , by Assemblyman Terry B . Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) , outlaws smoking in nearly all enclosed places of employment , including restaurants and shopping_malls , starting Jan . 1 . Violators are subject_to fines of up_to $ 500 per violation . There are certain exceptions , such_as bars , hotel lobbies and banquet rooms and workplaces with five or fewer employees if none object . Under the law , localities are free to pass even tougher restrictions . This and other recent bans on smoking are based on growing evidence that nonsmokers are injured by secondhand smoke . Last month the Journal of the American Medical Assn . published a study of 653 cases of lung_cancer among women who had never smoked -- in five metropolitan areas , including Los Angeles and San Francisco . It found that in women with long-term exposure to secondhand smoke , the risk of getting cancer was up_to 75 % higher than among those not exposed . The tobacco_industry claims that California ' s new rules are bad for business . But that is belied by the support for the Friedman bill from hotel and restaurant associations , which prefer a statewide level playing_field for all members . Wilson also deserves a cheer for announcing his opposition to Proposition 188 , the November ballot measure mounted by Philip Morris Inc. , the cigarette maker . It would nullify the Friedman bill , substitute weaker smoking rules and allow local exceptions . Unfortunately , the governor says he will be too busy running_for reelection to campaign against it . But on this , at least , he and his Democratic opponent , State_Treasurer Kathleen Brown , agree . It is urgent that all concerned with public health unite to crush this pernicious abuse of the initiative process .</TEXT>
