   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / A GALLERY OF MUSEUMS : SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO ; MISSION PRESERVES WINDOW ON THE PAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a large sense , the Mission San Juan ' s sprawling grounds have created an identity problem for the tourist attraction . People think_of the mission as a church because of its ornate 19th-Century chapel . They are drawn by the beauty of the mission grounds and its immaculate flower_gardens . But the Mission San Juan that officials want visitors to recognize is a museum -- a snapshot of romantic early California during the mid-1800s . &quot; The mission is its own museum , the mission is the museum and its own greatest artifact , &quot; said Ed Akins , volunteer coordinator for the Mission San Juan . &quot; There is the potential for an incredible learning experience here because everything is so well preserved . The mission looks pretty much as it was 200 years ago. &quot; Mission officials plan to tap into that potential . A panel of advisers is being put_together to help the mission become a better museum . &quot; We don ' t want this to be a place where you come_in the fourth grade and don ' t come_back until your child is in the fourth grade , &quot; Akins said . &quot; We ' re on the verge of getting bigger and better. &quot; One area that will be developed is the mission ' s living history program . Once a month , volunteers assume the role of a figure in the area ' s past , such_as an early Spanish governor of California . Preliminary plans call_for the program to take_place twice per month . Rooms at the mission will be occupied by the 19th-Century characters who will go_about their business as they did more_than 100 years ago . &quot; The rooms will be alive_with living history figures , &quot; Akins said . &quot; You can walk in and talk to them , ask questions about how they lived . It ' ll be like slipping into a time warp. &quot; Other projects include sprucing_up the current exhibits by repainting signs and updating instructional materials . Advisory panel members will be experts in historical fields such_as archeology , museum science and art history . FRANK MESSINA</TEXT>
