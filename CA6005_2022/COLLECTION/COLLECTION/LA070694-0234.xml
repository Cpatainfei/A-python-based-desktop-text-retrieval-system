   <HEADLINE> A ROLLER_COASTER RIDE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT ; TELEVISION : DEBORAH NORVILLE HAS RE-EMERGED AS CO-ANCHOR OF ' AMERICA TONIGHT ' ON CBS AFTER A TROUBLE-FILLED TENURE AT NBC ' S ' TODAY ' SHOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Deborah Norville comes sweeping into the small offices at &quot; America Tonight , &quot; her new CBS newsmagazine , apologizing for being late . Dressed in a coat-dress and brown pumps , her blond hair short and tousled , Norville looks looser and much happier than her days as anchor on &quot; NBC News at Sunrise , &quot; where she regularly looked perfect at 4 a.m. Back then , in makeup and set hair , polished nails clicking away at her computer , the rising star gave controlled answers in her first national interview ( for People magazine ) that revealed little of herself -- other_than that she thought it was a &quot; tragedy &quot; that more American women didn ' t sew their own clothes . ( The statement was hooted at by NBC News employees. ) &quot; Well , what do you want from me ? &quot; she says , laughing_at the recollection . &quot; I was 28 years old , you were from People magazine , and I was scared . When I left WMAQ ( the Chicago station where she had been an anchor ) , people there told me , ' Walk close to the walls at NBC -- they ' ll be out_to knife you. ' &quot; As it turned_out , it was NBC ' s own management that inadvertently did her in . Touted as the next &quot; golden girl &quot; in broadcasting when she joined the network in 1987 , Norville was given the newsreader job on &quot; Today &quot; in 1989 in a move to attract younger viewers . But co-host Jane Pauley thought management was trying to push her aside , so she quit the morning program . Norville took_over , but many viewers saw her as &quot; the other woman &quot; who had forced Pauley out , and the show ' s ratings tumbled . Norville left on maternity leave in 1991 and didn ' t return . Now the 35-year-old Norville has re-emerged as co-anchor of &quot; America Tonight , &quot; which is being given a 15-week summer tryout . She has won praise from TV critics for her early work_on the show , and even if the program does not win a permanent berth on the schedule , CBS News President Eric Ober says , &quot; Deborah is a strong , smart reporter and anchor . She ' s got an unlimited future here with us at CBS News. &quot; On top of her professional happiness , Norville and her husband , businessman Karl Wellner , are expecting their second child in December . &quot; I ' ve gone_through the loop-de-loop roller_coaster ride in my career , and I ' m still standing , &quot; Norville says proudly . &quot; My experience on the ' Today ' show was personally devastating . I was totally unprepared for what happened , and I didn ' t know if I would ever work in television again after all_the publicity . Instead , I ' ve survived . I would n ' t wish my experience on anybody , but I think it has made me a stronger person and a better journalist. &quot; At the height of the &quot; Today &quot; show debacle , Norville says , reporters trailed her in New York and all_the way back to her childhood in Dalton , Ga . &quot; There was one man -- from a respectable publication -- who bought a news documentary I ' d made in college and asked a plastic_surgeon to look_at it to see if I ' d had a nose_job . If he ' d called me , I could have told him this nose is my own. &quot; She believes the depiction of her as &quot; the other woman &quot; was unfair and sexist . &quot; If it had been a man , I don ' t think they ' d have written_about a ' younger , blonder ' anchor taking_over , &quot; she says . After her departure , she kept a low profile for a while -- even living with her family in France for three months -- then accepted an offer from ABC radio to host a talk_show out of her home . Unseen by her listeners , her looks not a focus , she thrived . &quot; I enjoyed talking to listeners , offering my opinions and having my son , Nicholas , nearby , &quot; she says . &quot; Doing the show restored my self-confidence. &quot; In 1992 , CBS News hired Norville as a correspondent for the newsmagazine &quot; Street Stories. &quot; Although she had won Emmys in Chicago for her hard-news reporting , her hiring was greeted with skepticism at CBS by those who knew her only by her looks and from the &quot; Today &quot; show drama . &quot; I was very surprised by what a good reporter she is , &quot; said Howard Rosenberg , an investigative producer for &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; who worked with Norville on several &quot; Street Stories &quot; assignments ( and is no relation_to The Times ' television critic ) . &quot; She is smart , she ' s well-prepared and she asks the right questions . And she ' s nice . Everywhere we went , people asked her for autographs . On one story we did , a bunch of postal inspectors lined_up after the interview to get her autograph ! &quot; * &quot; Street Stories &quot; died , but in May CBS named Norville and Dana King , formerly anchorwoman on ABC ' s weekend &quot; Good_Morning America , &quot; as the co-anchors of &quot; America Tonight , &quot; which premiered June 1 . The show has had a tough time in the ratings in its kamikaze time_slot opposite ABC ' s top-rated &quot; Home Improvement &quot; and the NBA playoffs on NBC , but CBS executives say they are pleased so far . With three newsmagazines already on the fall schedule , however , the best that &quot; America Tonight &quot; can hope for is a mid-season return . Norville likes to do upbeat , human-interest pieces , although she says these are not the only kind of stories she wants to do . &quot; This is not a nation of pessimists , deflated by defeat , &quot; she explains . &quot; If I spot a wedding_party when my husband and I are out driving , I make him stop the car so we can see . Journalists ought to focus_on the weddings , metaphorically , as well as the car wrecks that we see. &quot; Norville reported 10 stories before the show premiered , and she says it is difficult dealing with &quot; mommy guilt. &quot; Her 3-year-old son calls her work &quot; mommy movies. &quot; But the other day he said he wished she would n ' t make &quot; so many ' mommy movies. ' &quot; &quot; This is my work , and it includes travel , but it ' s tough on all_of us here with small children , &quot; Norville says . With a second child , she expects the tug will be stronger . But she plans to continue working during her pregnancy and to return to CBS after a maternity leave . TV news chews_up its female stars so rapidly that one TV critic , noting Norville ' s debut on &quot; America Tonight , &quot; compared her to Lazarus , who was raised from the dead in the Bible . &quot; I ' m a little young for that , &quot; she says , laughing . &quot; I love reporting , and I love this show . After what has happened in my career , I ' ve found it ' s best not to sweat out the future. &quot; * &quot; America Tonight &quot; airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on CBS ( Channels 2 and 8 ) .</TEXT>
