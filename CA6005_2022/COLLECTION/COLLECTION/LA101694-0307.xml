   <HEADLINE> VALLEY BRIEFING : THEY ' RE BACK ; SANTA ANAS BLOW BACK INTO TOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Santa Ana winds are_on their way , and with them comes the reminder of the wildfires last fall that claimed 1 # 241 structures , almost 200 # 000 acres and $ 1 billion in damages . Three people , each from Topanga Canyon , lost their lives . Santa Ana season runs from late summer to autumn , but sometimes extends into winter , knocking_out power , tripping burglar_alarms and whipping_up other bits of mischief as desert winds blow . The phenomenon originates hundreds of miles from Southern California in a high-pressure system over Utah . Although the topography and position of the San Fernando Valley put it in the route of the hot , dry winds that blow in from the desert -- the Valley has had gusts of up_to 60 m.p.h. -- the condition is generally strongest in the Riverside-San Bernardino area . The Santa Ana ' s aren ' t all bad . In addition to granting warm weather , they also blow the San Fernando Valley ' s pollutants out of our area . But they also carry mysteries in from the east . Wrote Joan Didion : &quot; It is the season of suicide and divorce and prickly dread , whenever the wind blows. &quot; Tracing the Name There are many theories , some legendary , as_to why the winds are called Santa Anas . Some believe the name comes from the Satanas , Spanish for Satan . But most likely they are named for the Santa Ana Canyon , the narrow gap in the Santa Ana Mountains in Orange and Riverside counties , where the winds are especially strong . Contributing Factors Dry cold_fronts passing_through the Great Basin states are followed by a high-pressure system that is centered over the Utah-Nevada border , creating westerly winds that eventually become Santa Anas . Flowing_from Desert to Valley Santa Ana winds move through the San Gabriel Mountains and approach the Valley from the north-northeast , funneling through the Soledad Canyon and Weldon Canyon area into the Valley . The heat of the wind is more the result of its downhill motion than its movement across the desert . This is their path : 1 . Air is cool and holds fair amount of moisture 2 . Air loses moisture as it moves_up mountains 3 . Wind speed increases as air funnels through mountain_passes 4 . Temperature of the air increases 5.5 degrees for every 1 # 000 feet it descends 5 . Air that passes_over and through mountains has lost almost all moisture Comparing gusts Santa Ana gusts have been recorded up_to 60 m.p.h. Here is how other weather systems ' winds compare : Sandstorm : 30 m.p.h. or more Dust_storm : 30 m.p.h. or more Tropical depression : 38 m.p.h. or less Tropical storm : 39-78 m.p.h. Gale : 39-54 m.p.h. Severe blizzard : 45 m.p.h. or more Hurricane : 74 m.p.h. or more * &quot; There was a desert wind blowing that night . It was one of those hot , dry Santa Anas that come_down through the mountain_passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch . On nights like that , every booze party ends in a fight , meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands ' necks . Anything can happen. &quot; -Raymond Chandler &quot; Red Wind &quot; Sources : National Weather Service , UCLA Atmospheric Science Dept. , Encyclopedia Americana , Weather of Southern California Researched and written by JULIE SHEER / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
