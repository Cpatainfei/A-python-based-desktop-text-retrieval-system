   <TEXT> UNCROWDED SKIES : Here ' s a way to avoid those traffic-choked freeways into Los Angeles : Fly over them . . . . &quot; We ' ve been getting lots of calls &quot; since the earthquake , said Tom Driscoll of Channel Islands Aviation , a charter service at Camarillo Airport . Some are commuters bound for Long_Beach or Ontario . Others are air passengers worried about missing their flights . . . . &quot; They just don ' t want to fight the traffic , &quot; Driscoll said . On Wednesday , two people chartered a plane to LAX to connect with a commercial flight . Cost : $ 110 per person . OIL AND WATER : Ventura County oil_production has declined from 40 million barrels in 1960 to 12 million in 1991 . But the industry is still here , as evidenced by recent spills : 168 # 000 gallons spilled into the Santa Clara River east of Piru , and 84 # 000 gallons leaked into McGrath Lake near Oxnard . . . . Now the company responsible_for the McGrath spill has made its initial report to state officials ( B1 ) . Still unexplained : What caused the leak . . . The report does provide an upbeat assessment of the spill , which killed more_than 200 birds . &quot; Effects were limited to transient visual impacts , &quot; the report said . LEAN TIMES : It ' s easy to gain weight : Just eat more -- which a lot of us did during the holidays . But going the other way is more complicated . You have to both eat less and exercise . . . . Which explains why January is boom time for Ventura County ' s workout palaces ( Ventura County Life , Page 24 ) . WINTER WALKS : Spring and summer are when most people hike the Los Padres National Forest , but winter offers its own attractions . . . . &quot; There ' s more water in the creeks , and you see lots of ducks and migratory birds , &quot; said Ojai District biologist George Garcia . &quot; You may_not see as_many animals , but you ' re a lot more likely to see tracks &quot; on the soft trails . . . . What you won ' t see : crowds of people . . . . Be prepared_for sudden changes in weather , including snowstorms , he said . &quot; It can be nice in Ventura , but when you get_on those ridge tops it can be twice as cold. &quot;</TEXT>
