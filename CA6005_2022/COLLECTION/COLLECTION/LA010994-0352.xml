   <HEADLINE> BILL BOYARSKY : ETHICS COPS ALWAYS GET THEIR NUN -- AND that ' s A PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When most people think_of a lobbyist , they visualize a flashy , glad-handing , free-spending kind of person , buying drinks and dinners for pols and dispensing campaign contributions to get favorable treatment for clients . Certainly nobody ' s vision of a lobbyist would be a nun in the plain skirt , blouse and sweater of the Sisters of Social_Service , who spends her days in the streets of South-Central Los Angeles working to obtain better housing for the poor . That is why Sister Diane Donoghue , executive_director of the nonprofit Esperanza Community Housing Corp. , was surprised to receive a letter from the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission proclaiming in bold type : &quot; This letter is to inform you that you may be subject_to the city ' s lobbyist registration requirement . City law requires you to respond to this notice within 15 days of the date noted above. &quot; Sister Diane having to register as a lobbyist ? Hard to believe . That was my reaction when I was told of the letter recently by another woman also active in the low-cost housing cause , Jan Breidenbach , executive_director of the Southern California Assn . of Non-Profit Housing . Breidenbach had received an identical letter . As I inquired into the affair , I learned the letter was a defective product of City_Hall ' s bureaucratic thinking and of a city lobby-control law that imposes unfair burdens on little guys while permitting powerful lobbyists to escape regulation . * The law , requiring lobbyists to pay a $ 35 registration fee and file quarterly reports on incomes and expenses , was passed in 1967 . It was supposed to reveal the names and financial resources of the powerful back-room lobbyists who shape city policies . These men and women earn their livings by guiding businesses through the regulatory maze and influencing legislation affecting them . But the City_Council , hostile to reform , made the ordinance so broad , so all-encompassing , that it was unenforceable . There could be hundreds or thousands of so-called lobbyists under its definition , far too many to regulate and prosecute . The ordinance says you ' re a lobbyist if , &quot; for pay or other consideration , &quot; you testify or write or speak_to a city official to influence action on legislation . Think_about the implications . Say you are a restaurant manager who testified against the city ' s anti-smoking ordinance . Under the law , you could be considered a lobbyist . You might also find yourself branded as a lobbyist if you are an official of an anti-abortion organization who is reimbursed for parking and mileage for driving to City_Hall to fight for your cause . I suppose that if I loaded a bunch of kids into a van , drove them to City_Hall so they could ask_for more money for playgrounds and then later treated the gang to Big Macs , they ' d be considered lobbyists . A Big Mac certainly fits into what the ordinance calls a &quot; consideration. &quot; The law was so stupid that it was ignored for 20 years . But in 1991 , voters , unhappy with City_Hall ' s ethical standards , approved a law creating the City Ethics Commission to oversee lobbying , campaign financing and government ethics . The new ethics cops were given the job of enforcing the old law . Unsuccessful in its attempt to get the council to pass a more practical lobby-control law , the Ethics Commission embarked_on a scorched-earth enforcement of the old one . Obviously , the ethics cops have been trying to make_a_point about the law ' s shortcomings . It ' s an old trick that bureaucrats practice to get their way . Sister Diane got caught in the net . She , Breidenbach and others are considered lobbyists because they appeared before the City_Council last August to oppose Mayor Richard Riordan ' s plan to sell the Downtown public_library to a Philip Morris subsidiary . They protested that the complicated financial features of the deal would end_up reducing city funds now used to help build low-cost housing . When she received the Ethics Commission letter , Sister Diane replied that she was not a lobbyist . &quot; We do not act_on behalf of individual clients but rather represent those persons who are economically disadvantaged and have need for decent affordable housing , &quot; she wrote . * I asked Benjamin Bycel , executive_director of the Ethics Commission , why his cops were pursuing Sister Diane . He replied the law required it . &quot; We have to be even-handed , &quot; he said . The solution , he said , is to change the law . &quot; For the last three years , the Ethics Commission has been working to junk the dinosaur lobbyist law we work under , &quot; he said . For example , the commission proposal would exempt anyone earning less than $ 12 # 000 a year for lobbying . But don ' t expect such a sensible solution to pass . Other portions of the Ethics Commission proposal would tighten regulation of those still covered by the law . Powerful lobbyists have used their influence with the council to bottle_up the proposal in a committee . &quot; If they ( Sister Diane and the other housing advocates ) want changes to happen , they have to talk to the City_Council , &quot; said LeeAnn M . Pelham , deputy director for operations . &quot; We are not the enemy. &quot; Meanwhile , the ethics cops are not exactly in hot pursuit of Sister Diane . And she ' s not on the run . &quot; I think they will let it ride , &quot; she said . &quot; I told them I would not pay the registration fee . I am not a lobbyist . that ' s dumb. &quot;</TEXT>
