   <TEXT> The rocking chair is worn and dilapidated , like the rest of Cuba . Manuel sits in the shade of his porch on the outskirts of Havana , overlooking a neighborhood of modest homes baking in the August sun . Idly waving away the summer ' s plague of flies , he rocks and waits for a sign . Nothing stirs on the cracked and potholed street stretching in front of his house . At the corner , a line of people waits endlessly for a bus . Another Soviet-made truck roars past , enveloping the queue in a cloud of gritty smoke . Across the street , a vacant_lot has been turned_into a tiny park adorned with a pair of benches . A rail-thin drunk staggers into the park and passes_out on a bench , his arm flung across his grizzled face to block_out the blinding sun . &quot; I can ' t see anything , &quot; I say . &quot; The drunk , &quot; says Manuel . &quot; Forty-nine. &quot; In Cuba , everything can be reduced to numbers . To Manuel ' s practiced eye , the landscape is filled with symbols -- sun , flies , line , truck , park and drunk -- each of which has a numeric equivalent . If he can interpret the scene correctly , one of those symbols might represent that night ' s winning number in la bolita , Cuba ' s illegal lottery . Every evening , millions of Cubans put their pesos down with a local lottery bank and cross their fingers : Tonight may be the night ! From his porch , Manuel spots Julio , his clothes billowing like sails about his gauntness . Julio hoves to and settles his bones into a chair . Julio is a listero , the man who takes the bets , the lowest-level employee in a bolito organization . Manuel tells him about the revelation of the drunk . Julio nods ; it is a sign . Manuel hands him 10 pesos ( 25 cents ) to put_on 49 , the number assigned to drunk , and 89 , the number of the lottery itself , which we have been discussing all afternoon . From the folds of his shirt , Julio withdraws a sheet_of_paper , marks_down the numbers and gives Manuel a receipt . If the police see this simple transaction , it will mean a fine and three to nine months in jail for Manuel and as much as four years in jail for Julio . * August , 1994 , was Cuba ' s fourth anniversary under the revolutionary government ' s Special Period in Peacetime , the austerity program intended to defend socialism after the disappearance of Soviet aid in the late ' 80s . That month also saw the most violent protests against the revolution in more_than 30 years . Rioters smashed the windows of Havana stores and hotels , and tens of thousands of unhappy Cubans fled on rafts toward the United States . Since then , the tensions have abated but not the underlying problems . For most Cubans , life has never been worse . Despite revolutionary rhetoric , the socialist safety net has collapsed . The new reality : You need money to survive . The only reliable sources of food , clothing and medicine are government-run dollar stores . The official exchange is one peso to one dollar , but ever-changing black_market rates are approximately 40 pesos to one dollar . The average Cuban salary is less than $ 10 a month , and without dollars you cannot survive . In response , many Cubans have decided to opt_out of the revolutionary system , to stay home para resolver , &quot; to resolve &quot; life ' s necessities . Some lucky ones have relatives able to circumvent U.S. restrictions on sending dollars to Cuba . Others survive by stealing from the state or by dealing on the black_market . For the rest , tiene que inventar : &quot; You have to improvise. &quot; It is never enough . Many Cubans see only one way para resolver : by playing la bolita , an illegal lottery game with deep roots in Cuban culture . La bolita is one of the original_sins in revolutionary Cuba . To the revolution , gambling is anathema , associated with the reviled dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista . Before 1959 , on any Havana street you could bet_on cockfighting , cards , dice , jai-alai , horse_racing and slot_machines , and the fancy tourist hotels housed casinos run_by American gangster Meyer Lansky and his mob . For Fidel Castro ' s revolutionaries , Cuba ' s social evils -- drugs and prostitution -- seemed to spring from games_of_chance . Millions in rake-offs supported Batista and corrupted the political_system . Batista fled Cuba on Jan . 1 , 1959 , and within days the new government had outlawed all gambling_games . When Castro announced in 1961 that the revolution was a Marxist-Leninist movement , gambling suddenly became not just another crime but a &quot; capitalist ulcer. &quot; Still , gambling persists . It is a Cuban tradition . The Spanish conquistadors broke the monotony between battles by gambling on cards and dice . Games_of_chance were illegal in colonial Cuba , but in 1812 the Spanish crown , drained by European wars , decided to establish an official lottery . Soon every man , woman and child was buying tickets and dreaming of lottery numbers . Around 1876 , a Chinese shop owner in Havana cashed_in_on lottery mania by introducing Cubans to the mysteries of the 36 numbers game , known as chee fah in Cantonese and chiff in Cuba . Every number between 1 and 36 has an attendant symbol . The owner would draw the number and its symbol on a sheet_of_paper , roll it up and hang it in front of his store . Anyone who could guess the number would win a small jackpot . As a lure , he handed_out little verses called charadas , which were riddles whose answer was the symbol . At a certain hour , no more bets were taken , the paper was unrolled and the winner was announced . The only complaint of the public was that they suspected the games were rigged ; it was too easy to switch the numbers . The bankers responded by hitching their game to the national lottery ; the possible numbers expanded from 36 to 100 . Chiff was renamed la bolita , after the &quot; little ball &quot; drawn_in the official lottery . Despite the relentless crackdowns since 1959 , la bolita has managed to survive and even thrive . In the poor neighborhoods far from the orbits of official Cuba , it is the residents ' passion , their only hope . Every evening , the hottest question in Cuba is , &quot; Que salio ? &quot; ( What came_out ? ) * On the porch , Julio notices me looking_at a string of green and yellow beads hanging_around his wrist . He tells me it is a sign of devotion to Orula , the deity of divination . Julio is a creyente , a believer in Cuban Santaria , the religion of Africa ' s Yoruba people transposed to a New World Catholic setting . When the Yoruba slaves came_to Cuba in the 19th Century , they hid their African deities under the disguises of Catholic saints . One of the cornerstones of the Santaria faith is Ifa , the art of foretelling the future . The system of divination is based on chance , on throwing shells or nuts and seeing in their falls the caminos or roads that will help the followers fulfill their destinies . I ask Julio whether Santaria can be used to find the winning numbers . &quot; No , no , no , &quot; he responds . No creyente would use Ifa for something as mundane as foretelling the numbers . However , the methods of divination used in la bolita may have their roots in Santeria . The signs of the future are everywhere ; the trick is having the right spiritual attitude to interpret them . For many , this state is a kind of religious vision , when you see behind the surface of things to the invisible paths of power running the world . Julio uses Santeria to enhance that vision : &quot; Luck comes from my head ( the seat of his deity ) . I use my head to look_for images that can tell me the numbers . Some people , when they have problems in life , they sit_down to work_out the numbers , but at that moment they lose them . The problem is , their head isn ' t fresh . Santeria helps me rogar mi cabeza ( &quot; to pray to my head &quot; ) , so the inspiration comes more easily. &quot; Rogar la cabeza is performed in initiation ceremonies when the mind must be purified to prepare it for the seating of the deity . It is also performed if the creyente is worried or distracted . Julio washes his head in coconut water ; the result is clear vision , with all_the obstacles erased . After one such rite , Julio dreamed of a bicycle ( 52 ) and found a bill in his pocket with &quot; 96 &quot; written_on it . His vision was clear ; those were the signs . He won 8 # 500 pesos . * The streets of Old Havana smell of raw sewage in the heat . Skinny dogs slink down the sidewalks , sniffing through scattered piles of garbage . Dirty water drips from balconies ; shouts echo off slowly collapsing walls . Jobless youths in tattered shirts idle on the corners , eyes watching for the police while they furtively trade_in cigarettes , bootleg rum and a plate of ham_sandwiches . Jorge , a friend of Manuel , leads me into a decrepit building , its courtyard rebounding with the shouts of running children . We climb to Antonio ' s one-room apartment , where the heat hangs_in a bluish , cigarette-fueled haze . On a chair by the door , a dark-skinned doll is enshrined , with peso notes pinned to its clothes and cigars and a glass of water at its feet . This is Eleggua , the opener of roads , the trickster god of Santeria . Antonio sits at his table , chain-smoking . The sweat beads on his brow ; there is no fan to move the stifling air . On the wall hangs an olive-green cap ; a sheet_of_paper covered with numbers lies on the table in front of him . Antonio is an officer in the &quot; glorious and ever-faithful &quot; Revolutionary Armed Forces -- and a listero . I am shocked ; Jorge shrugs and smiles . In one of the ironies of the Special Period , even guardians of the revolutionary flame tiene que inventar . &quot; I have to be a listero in_order to live , &quot; Antonio says defensively . &quot; It ' s the only job I can make money at without robbing someone . As a soldier , I make six pesos ( 15 cents ) a day . A pack of cigarettes costs 10 pesos , and I smoke two packs a day . Look_at me , look_at this apartment . I don ' t even have a fan or a refrigerator. &quot; He yells for one of his children to bring him a glass of water . An old_woman enters the apartment and pulls_out some crumpled pesos . She is playing 29 because it is her birthday and 12 , holy woman , her favorite number . Cuba has no official lotteries because there are no random events in a socialist society . The winning numbers must come from abroad . Every weekday evening at 10 , Cubans tune their Soviet shortwave radios to the frequency of Ecos de Torbe , a station broadcasting from Venezuela . A delirious baritone announces the first- , second- and third-place winning tickets in the provincial lottery . The last two digits of the five-digit Venezuelan tickets become the winners of the Cuban bolita . The old_woman bets 29 and 12 , fijo and corrido , the two most common ways of playing la bolita . Fijo is a gamble that 29 or 12 will appear as the last two digits of the first place winning ticket , with a 75-to-1 payout . Corrido is similar to a show bet at the track ; the old_woman is betting that the numbers will appear in any of the three places on odds of 20 to 1 . If she were more daring , she would also play parl or candado , betting that she can guess two or three of the winners for 800-1 and 2 # 400-1 odds , respectively . Although the largest pot rarely amounts to more_than $ 300 , this sum makes the difference between a_few basic comforts and the grinding shortages of the Special Period . Antonio marks the old_woman ' s numbers and the amount of her bets_on the list . The maximum bet_on any one number is about 30 pesos ( 75 cents ) , ensuring that a run of big wins does not break the bank . The bank has also decreed a_few limitados , popular numbers on which it will not take bets , such_as recent winners and holy_days . Antonio has an interest in the success of his regulars , because he receives a percentage of their winnings . To ensure repeat business , he cultivates a reputation as an honest listero who brings his clients un mano fresco , &quot; a fresh hand &quot; -- good_luck . * At 8 that evening , Antonio closes his list -- no more bets -- and waits for his collector , the next rung_up in the numbers organization , called the banco , or bank . Bancos are as secretive as any Leninist revolutionary party . Above Antonio are as_many as a dozen collectors , a chief collector and the banquero , banker , but Antonio only knows his contact . The chief collector takes the lists from his corps of collectors and oversees the operation ; the banquero provides the capital to cover any losses . Every evening , the chief collector brings the lists to la mesa , the table where he and his accountants check the lists for winners and divide the money . Often only the head collector knows the banquero ' s identity . Antonio claims that he sighted his banquero only once . &quot; I had to visit my collector because of a problem with a list . He had a visitor , a man in a general ' s uniform , and told me to wait outside . Afterward , I asked him , ' Who was that guy ? ' ' That was the banquero , ' he said. &quot; Antonio slams the table . &quot; Generals and functionaries -- those are the only sons-of-bitches that have enough money to be bankers ! &quot; He yells at his children : Where is his water ? No one knows how many bancos there are in Havana . Antonio claims there are more_than 100 in Old Havana alone . Assuming an average of 1 # 000 players serviced by each banco , that stretches the bounds of credibility . Nevertheless , outside of the Vedado and Miramar neighborhoods , home to many of the revolutionary elite , everybody I meet knows how to play , and they know the identity of the local listero . La bolita is ubiquitous . Between customers , Antonio pulls_out of a hiding_place one of his most treasured possessions : a computer printout of the cabala , an esoteric guide to the lottery numbers and their symbols . If the police found this book , it would mean an automatic jail term . &quot; Look , even the scientists are playing la bolita , &quot; he says . ( In Cuba , only scientists and a_few government_offices are likely to have computers. ) The cabala is a guide to finding the winning numbers in your dreams and in the events of daily life . Its core is the charada , a list of symbols for every number from 1 to 100 . The original , the Charada China , is the most widely used , but if it does not have the symbol you are looking_for , you can try the Charada Matancera , Hindu , Americana , Cubana or Oriental . New York , banana , pigeon , sea voyage , dream , roller_skates , telegram , midnight and Havana ' s Capitol are all designated by the number 87 in the cabala . Antonio is fortunate to have a preprinted cabala ; most Cubans laboriously copy theirs by hand . As we leave him , he is still yelling for water . Later , Jorge tells me why Antonio has no fan or refrigerator , why he is so angry . He has gambled big and lost . Instead of giving his list to the bank , he told the collector that the police had been around , so he had not taken any bets . He kept the list and the money , hoping to make a nice profit after paying_off his players . But luck turned against him : His players won big , and he had to sell the fan and refrigerator to cover their winnings . Now he is planning to keep the list again , gambling that he can earn enough to buy back his appliances . * In his 1955 Buick , Manuel ' s friend Carlito and I cruise along one of the ring_roads linking Havana ' s suburbs . We are going_to see a man everybody says is a banker . Dirt streets lead to poor neighborhoods of wooden shacks and little children running naked in the yard . Along one of these streets rises a neat , two-story , brick-and-concrete house . The walls are freshly painted , curtains hang_in the windows and a TV antenna ascends to the sky . Its owners are Pepe and Nilda , a chubby couple in their late 40s . A full-size refrigerator looms in the kitchen , and each floor has an enormous Russian television_set . The neighbors call it &quot; the house that la bolita built. &quot; &quot; La bolita is the easiest way to make enough money to raise a family , &quot; says Pepe . &quot; Are you a banker ? &quot; I ask him . &quot; No , no , I ' m just a player . I ' ve just been luckier than others. &quot; His biggest win came from a near accident . He was crossing the street when a bicyclist whizzed by , nearly knocking him down and running_over his feet . His shoes were ruined , so he had to buy a new pair . That night he played 31 , 96 and 52 -- old shoes , new shoes and bicycle -- and won 5 # 500 pesos ( $ 137.50 ) Ninety-five percent of their neighbors play la bolita , according to Pepe and Nilda , even the children . The other 5 % are either the rare Cubans who do not like to gamble or those condemned to lives with no luck . The local policemen do not play ; they send their wives to do_it for them . The neighborhood still has its Committee for the Defense of the Revolution to protect them from &quot; subversive elements , &quot; but five years of the Special Period have dissolved the authority of the trompetas ( &quot; trumpets &quot; ) , the CDR militants who once were a constant bullying presence . &quot; Here the rule is stick_up for your neighbor , &quot; says Nilda . &quot; The trompetas have a hard_time , because they don ' t follow the rule . If they try to stop us from playing la bolita , we will make life very difficult for them . La bolita is the only thing that gives us hope for tomorrow. &quot; Despite this bravado , they take me up_to the second floor , so prying eyes cannot see that they have a foreigner in the house . Pepe and Nilda are viciosas -- addicts . They live to divine the winning numbers . They will even swallow their disdain for the revolution if they can find tonight ' s winners in its designs . They can play Castro , for example . He is No . 1 -- but not just because he is el maximo lider . Since his rebel days in the Sierra Maestra , he has been el caballo , the horse , and in the charada , el caballo is also No . 1 . &quot; We can also play against the revolution , &quot; says Nilda . &quot; If Fidel appears on TV , we might play 83 , tragedy , the number of the Special Period , because that ' s what he ' s done to Cuba. &quot; Almost everyone is playing 38 and 65 , money and food . Seven is the_Virgin of Regla ( who is also the sea goddess Yemaya of Santeria ) and mierda , played when a diarrhea epidemic runs_through the neighborhood . Ninety-three , revolution , has come_out a lot this year . Pepe and Nilda offer us lunch : steaming plates of rice and beans , boiled sweet_potatoes and fried plantains . Nilda brings_in a platter of grilled pork chops with curves of rib still attached . Following Cuban etiquette , the couple retire so the guests can eat_in peace . Cubans eat_in silence because as children they are told that it is bad manners to talk at meals . Nevertheless , between bites , Carlito whispers , &quot; ' Only a banker could afford this meal. &quot; * After Julio leaves , Manuel and I borrow a pair of bicycles to pedal a_few miles out_to Raul and Gaby ' s house . Beyond Manuel ' s neighborhood , Havana ' s outskirts grade imperceptibly into rural Cuba . The houses become poorer and the vegetation lusher , with vivid green banana and fruit_trees rising between the dwellings . By the side of a communal refuse pile , Raul and Gaby live_in a wooden shack . A pig grunts in a pen along one wall , and chickens_run in the yard next to a small garden . Behind the door , a small cabinet holds two metal caldrons filled with miniature iron tools , identifying the owners as devotees of Ogun , the Santeria iron deity . Although their clothes are frayed , they have a little meat to their bones , and their eyes are bright . Raul and Gaby are surviving . The couple apologize for only having coffee to offer their guests . In these hard_times , one of Cubans ' great embarrassments is that they have had to curtail their normally effusive hospitality . Raul ' s and Gaby ' s jobs ended two years ago ; since then they have turned_to la bolita to earn a living . He is a collector , and she works as an accountant at la mesa , the table where the bank ' s nightly business is transacted . They are also hopelessly addicted players who spend every waking moment in a quest_for the winning number . At 8 p.m. , when the lists are closed , Raul climbs_on his bicycle and begins his work collecting . He has less than an hour to visit his listeros , collect their lists and count the money . The lists are folded into little squares , which he stuffs into a cigarette pack for the dangerous journey along the blacked-out streets to la mesa . Two types of enemies prey on bolita collectors : robbers , who know collectors often carry thousands of pesos , and the police . The police often set_up checkpoints for random searches of identity papers at night . If they find a scrap of paper scrawled with a_few numbers in your pocket , you are automatically a player . The penalties range from a_few months in jail for a player to eight years and the confiscation of all his possessions for a banquero . Like a mafia family , the banco protects its own by paying the fines and taking_care of the prisoner ' s family while he or she is in jail . If Raul is stopped , he immediately throws the cigarette pack into the bushes and , if questioned , denies its ownership . If they do not notice it , he retrieves it later and continues to la mesa . For his risks , Raul receives a flat fee of around 500 pesos a month as well as a percentage of the profits if business is good . By 9 , the lists must arrive_at la mesa , where Gaby and the other workers check for errors , recount the money and wait for the 10 o ' clock announcement of the winners . Unfortunately , Venezuela is a long way away , and very few Havana radios hear the signal clearly . Arguments over what the announcer was really saying are the most common cause of bloodshed in the bolita world . The other danger of relying_on the radio is official manipulation of the airwaves . On April 17 , 1993 , bancos were rocked by a huge number of bets_on 33 , 9 and 42 , that night ' s winners . Raul and Gaby smelled a rat and pulled_out their bolita bible ; they discovered that the same numbers had won on March 11 . At 5 the next morning , they tuned_in to the Venezuela station and heard a completely different -- and correct -- set of numbers . The government had taped the March 11 numbers , inserted the new date and passed the word on Cuba ' s incredibly efficient rumor mill that 33 , 9 and 42 were sure things . They jammed the Venezuelan signal and broadcast the doctored announcement behind a camouflage of static . The huge payouts &quot; exploded &quot; many banks . When the numbers have been agreed on , Gaby and her cohorts set to work . Each list is scanned for winners , the payouts are totaled and the money is divided . The incriminating papers are burned as soon as the work is done , and the head collector leaves to distribute the payouts down the network . The oldest expression in la bolita is , &quot; The bank loses and laughs ; the player wins , and it disappears. &quot; Those rare occasions when the bank has to make a big payout often turn ugly . The gamblers expect their winnings immediately , and the penalty for non-payment may be death . A banquero ' s only escape may be to disappear into Eastern Cuba or hop_on a raft to Miami . I ask Raul and Gaby why they are not living better on all their earnings from the banco . Raul pulls_out another sheet_of_paper covered with figures . &quot; This is all_the money that my listeros owe me , &quot; he says . &quot; They ' re all viciosas , and they keep asking_for loans. &quot; * On the way back , one of my tires goes flat . Manuel ' s house is more_than two miles away along a winding avenue . As we walk , night falls , and not a light shines in all_the neighborhoods we pass_through . The electricity is off again . Clouds have covered the moon and stars , and I stumble over the cracks in the sidewalk . We begin to climb a long hill and now and then hear the whir of bicycles coasting by invisibly in the dark . The next morning , the sun returns to scorch Havana . Julio drops_by , and as he and Manuel chat , I can ' t take it anymore . &quot; Well , what were the winning numbers ? &quot; &quot; Buzzard , bed and doctor , &quot; says Julio . &quot; Thirty-three , 57 and 80. &quot; Manuel shrugs his shoulders . His prediction , 49 for drunk and 89 for lottery , is good for three days . He rocks and looks_out from his porch . The bench is empty , but the line for the bus is still there . He begins to count , one , two , three , four . . . 23 people waiting along the curb . It is a sign .</TEXT>
