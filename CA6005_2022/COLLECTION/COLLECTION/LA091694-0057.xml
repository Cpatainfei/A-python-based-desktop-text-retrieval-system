   <HEADLINE> THOROUGHBRED RACING ; ZITO STILL HAS HIGH ASPIRATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nick Zito is ready to concede Horse of the Year to Holy Bull , if he wins the $ 500 # 000 Woodward on Super Saturday at Belmont Park . If he doesn ' t ? &quot; If Go_for Gin wins , why isn ' t that a big deal ? &quot; the trainer asked . &quot; If Bull wins , I concede , but that hasn ' t happened yet . And the year ' s not over yet , either. &quot; Eight horses , all Grade I stakes winners , were entered on Thursday for the 1 1 / 8-mile Woodward , one of six Grade I stakes on the card Saturday at Belmont with prize_money totaling more_than $ 1.5 million . The Zito-trained Go_for Gin , winner of the Kentucky_Derby , was made the early 9-2 second choice to Travers winner Holy Bull at 8-5 . Holy Bull , trained by Jimmy Croll , will ship to Belmont Saturday morning from his home at Monmouth Park in New Jersey . &quot; Holy Bull is a wonderful horse , &quot; Zito said . &quot; But I think championships should be won in championship races . You remember the year the Raiders were 9-7 , but when they got_to the playoffs , they won all_the big races . &quot; The only race Holy Bull has won like that was the Travers. &quot; Holy Bull finished a badly beaten 12th in the Kentucky_Derby , then skipped the Preakness and Belmont Stakes , in which Go_for Gin finished second to Tabasco Cat both times . Since the Derby , Holy Bull has won the Metropolitan Handicap , Dwyer , Haskell and Travers . &quot; I ' m very confident with him , &quot; Holy Bull ' s rider , Mike Smith , said . &quot; I know that if he runs his race , he ' ll be a tough horse to beat. &quot; Croll has said the Woodward will be Holy Bull ' s last race of the year , while most of the rest of the Eclipse Award contenders will go_on to the Breeders ' Cup in November at Churchill Downs . Also in the Woodward field will be defending champion Bertrando , 1993 Belmont Stakes winner Colonial Affair , Suburban winner Devil His Due , Pistols and Roses , Tinners Way and Brunswick . The 3-year-olds , Go_for Gin and Holy Bull , will carry 121 pounds . The rest will carry 126 . The other races on the big card will be the $ 111 # 800 Futurity for 2-year-old colts , the $ 107 # 900 Matron for 2-year-old fillies , the seven-furlong Vosburgh at $ 200 # 000 , the $ 200 # 000 Ruffian for fillies and mares , and the 1 3 / 8-mile Man o ' War on grass . The Ruffian Handicap , although drawing a smaller field , is nearly the equal of the Woodward in competitiveness . The favorite will be Sky Beauty , who was assigned the huge impost of 130 pounds , 17 more_than the highly regarded Dispute . &quot; She ' s getting_up there now where it ' s really tough , &quot; said Sky Beauty ' s trainer , H . Allen Jerkens , who also trains Devil His Due . &quot; If she can carry that much weight and win on Saturday , she ' s really special. &quot; Sky Beauty , a 4-year-old filly , has run 10 of her 16 career races at Belmont Park and won all 10 . Nine 2-year-olds were entered in the Futurity , including Hopeful winner Wild Escapade , and the Matron drew a field of six juvenile fillies , including D . Wayne Lukas ' highly regarded and unbeaten Flanders . Jerkens also has a horse in the field of 11 entered for the Vosburgh , Virginia Rapids , and the Man o ' War drew a field of nine , including 1992 Breeders ' Cup Turf winner Fraise , Fourstars Allstar and Solar Splendor . &quot; It ' s a great day of racing , there ' s no doubt about that , &quot; Jerkens said .</TEXT>
