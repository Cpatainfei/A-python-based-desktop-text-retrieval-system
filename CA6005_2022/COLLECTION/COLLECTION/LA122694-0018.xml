   <HEADLINE> IN BIHAC , A HOSPITAL UNDER SIEGE ; WAR : MEDICINE AND FOOD ARE ALMOST GONE FOR 900 PATIENTS TRAPPED IN A SERB CHOKEHOLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Regional Bihac Hospital , which cares_for an area with a population of more_than 350 # 000 that has been surrounded by Serbian rebels for three years , has managed through the sacrificial dedication of its staff to continue its work . Yet even when aid convoys were able to pass_through to this region , and along with the help of humanitarian organizations , the hospital was unable to do all that was expected of it under its mandate . Since April , not one sizable shipment has reached the hospital from the world humanitarian organizations ; we have received only several small consignments of medicines via the World_Health_Organization , the Red_Cross and Doctors Without Borders . The hospital has exhausted the last of its food and medical reserves , so that the feeding of the sick and wounded , more_than 900 patients , is now limited to one meal per day . Treatment can be given only to the most desperate cases , so we can no longer even consider treatment of any kind that would lead to our patients ' recovery . Operations are being performed under local_anesthesia , since we lack the basic instruments and medicines needed to carry_out normal operations . The hospital is_full of premature and stillborn babies ; babies that are born full-term are_well under the desired weight . For a long_time now , we have been lacking any kind of baby food and are not_able to feed these underweight infants . In this desperate situation , without the necessary food and medicines , infectious_diseases are spreading -- tuberculosis , intestinal diseases , hepatitis , vitamin A deficiency . This hospital is no longer in a position to help the inhabitants of this area . All the employees of the hospital appeal_to the whole world and especially to the world_health_organizations , humanitarian organizations , doctors and all medical workers to raise their voices for help for the Bihac Regional Hospital . If help does not come immediately , help will no longer be necessary , as there will not be a single patient left ; such a fate may also be in_store for the rest of the inhabitants of this region . We believe that the world has a moral responsibility to help us ; we ask that every_last possibility be taken_to do so . Please help us . Alone we can no longer do anything .</TEXT>
