   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON WELFARE ; IS ANY HUSBAND BETTER THAN NONE ? ; PUSHING POOR UNWED MOTHERS INTO MARRIAGE WILL PERPETUATE ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS THAT HARM WOMEN AND CHILDREN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; It ' s so nice to have a man around the house , &quot; cooed a 1950s pop song . In the ' 90s , could that same sentiment lead to a fix for our social problems ? Suddenly , we are hearing about marriage as the cure-all for poverty , drug_abuse , crime and declining levels of education . Many welfare reformers propose that women be coerced to slip_on wedding_rings before they pick_up their Aid to Families with Dependent Children checks . Even Bill_Clinton -- for whom welfare reform is usually tied to education and day_care -- touted marriage for welfare moms in his State of the Union speech . But do we really want a 15-year-old to marry her gang-member boyfriend , so their toddler can be caught in the cross-fire ? How about the woman who has just given_birth to the child of a crack addict ? A good family is wonderful , but a dysfunctional family is not , nor is it a solution to drug_abuse and poverty . When I was growing_up in the ' 50s , girls married if they got pregnant . Too often , that was what family values meant . Let me tell you about some of those family values in families I knew . One woman was married to a Navy officer who regularly beat her . She put_on heavy make-up and tried to pretend it didn ' t happen . Another wed an alcoholic who was abusive to their four children . She remembers driving her car along a highway watching the telephone_poles go_by , trying to work_up the nerve to smash her car into them to end her misery . ( She didn ' t . She went_home and threw her husband out , got a job and made something of her life. ) That old song waxes sentimental about &quot; a guy in pipe and slippers who will help to zip your zippers , &quot; and if every marriage produced a loving home , I ' d join those calling_for pregnant girls to get_married . Unfortunately , this is not the case . There were nearly as_many teen-age pregnancies in the 1950s as there are today , the difference then being that the couples got_married . One result : a soaring divorce rate as those marriages collapsed . President Clinton also talked_of making young_women who have babies stay_at home with their parents or guardians , to break the cycle in which the welfare department takes the place of the father . But often , the home is a place of misery for poor girls . I remember being shown the window of an urban housing project , and my guide commented that the apartment to which it belonged housed three generations of women on crack -- daughter , mother and granddaughter . Getting a young mother out of this environment makes more sense than forcing her to stay . Charles Murray , author of &quot; Losing Ground , &quot; advocates getting_rid_of welfare altogether . Murray says that relatives will pitch_in and help_out with kids . Who will do the &quot; pitching_in &quot; in that housing-project apartment ? Republican Bill Bennett , the former secretary_of_education , wants to immediately end welfare for unmarried mothers . What does he suggest in its place ? &quot; We must invest generously in the kind of orphanages and group homes that provide order and care. &quot; Shades of Charles Dickens ! Indeed , small , well-run orphanages may help care_for children in an overburdened foster-care system . But the idea that we should penalize poor , unmarried mothers -- many of them good mothers -- by taking their children away boggles the mind . The cost of such a program would be enormous and history tells us what a rotten job we ' ve done with other large-scale institutions such_as psychiatric_hospitals and reform_schools . Illegitimacy wasn ' t created by welfare . Early in the 1960s , sociologist Oscar Lewis found the same social patterns in the slums of Rio , in American cities , among poor rural whites and Native_Americans : &quot; Few will marry . For men who have no steady jobs , no property and no prospect of wealth to pass_on to their children , who live_in the present without expectations of the future , a free union makes_good sense . The women , for their part , will turn_down offers of marriage from men who are likely to be immature , punishing and generally unreliable. &quot; A poverty culture flourished where community and other social_systems were in decay . In the short run , giving women access to contraception , job training and decent day_care will assure that children have at least one responsible parent . Broadening the idea of manhood beyond breadwinning will also help ; a father can love and care_for a child , and the experience will enhance his life even if he ' s not the right partner for a marriage . Marriage is a wonderful institution , the source of love , joy and nurture . But it ' s not a quick_fix for social problems .</TEXT>
