   <HEADLINE> TAKE TWO HERBS AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING ; HEALTH : FOR A GROWING NUMBER OF PARENTS -- AND DOCTORS -- THE TREATMENT OF CHOICE IS HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Gail Gutierrez ' s 13-month-old son Daniel was found to have a double ear infection , the Santa Monica woman left her pediatrician ' s office with the requisite prescription for antibiotics . But Gutierrez had no intention of filling it . The prescription was only meant as a backup in case Daniel didn ' t respond to this brew : pulsatilla , an oral homeopathic remedy ; the herb echinacea , and Mullin oil , an herbal eardrop treatment . Seven days later , when Gutierrez returned to the pediatrician for a follow-up exam , her son ' s infection had cleared_up . &quot; I ' ve always used homeopathic remedies , &quot; says Gutierrez , 27 . &quot; Daniel ' s never had antibiotics. &quot; Homeopathy , a 200-year-old practice involving the use of minute doses of pharmaceutical agents , has long been big on the Westside , where some embrace alternative living as religion . Chain drug stores here offer homeopathic remedies over-the-counter and several pharmacies specialize in homeopathic remedies and herbs . Increasingly , however , the alternative healing method is being used on children -- to treat maladies ranging from teething pain and colic to upper respiratory infections . Though homeopathic remedies themselves are considered harmless -- they are exempt from federal Food and Drug Administration regulations -- the trend toward pediatric homeopathy makes some local physicians nervous . Potentially , they warn , parents who use homeopathy might allow a child ' s cold or ear infection to steadily worsen , perhaps eventually leading to pneumonia or loss of hearing . Another concern is that a small number of hard-core homeopathy adherents refuse to have their children vaccinated out of concern that vaccines might be harmful . That , experts say , could expose children to outbreaks of life-threatening diseases . Despite such worries , however , the demand for homeopathic treatment is rising -- and a growing number of physicians are taking steps to meet it . These doctors see at least some merit to homeopathy , and some of them credit patients for making them aware of it . &quot; Half of my practice turns_to homeopathy , &quot; said Dr. Jay Gordon , a pediatrician with offices in Santa Monica and Malibu who describes himself as self-taught in homeopathy . &quot; I really started listening to my patients who felt antibiotics and tubes didn ' t always work ( for ear infections ) and who didn ' t like antibiotics ' side_effects . And bacteria have developed a resistance to antibiotics . It is frightening . We need to try different methods to treat children. &quot; Homeopathy ( from the Greek Homios , for similar , and pathos , for suffering ) is based on the belief that a substance that causes certain symptoms can cure those symptoms when administered in microdoses . For example , a tincture of belladonna , derived from a highly poisonous , fever-inducing plant called deadly_nightshade , is used to fight fever . The remedies are intended to act_on the same principle that allergy shots do , selectively stimulating the immune_system . Homeopathy has become a booming business nationwide , experts say . According to U.S. homeopathic manufacturers , it generates $ 250 million in annual sales and is growing at a rate of 25 % a year . * Critics liken homeopathic remedies to placebos and faith_healing . The compounds , they assert , are so diluted that virtually no molecules from the original substance are left in them , rendering them impotent . But homeopathic practitioners contend that molecules from the compounds they use imprint a kind of permanent energy pattern on the surrounding water molecules . Those water molecules , they say , become activated and more powerful when shaken vigorously , producing a highly effective medicine . And homeopathy appears to be gaining some legitimacy in the United States , as it already has in Europe . A report on the first clinical trial of homeopathy by a U.S. doctor was published this month in &quot; Pediatrics , &quot; a respected medical journal . Dr. Jennifer Jacobs , a physician who uses only homeopathy in her practice in Evergreen , Wash. , reported on a study she conducted using homeopathy in conjunction with oral rehydration to treat diarrhea in children , the leading cause of death for children worldwide . The study showed a decrease in diarrhea of about 15 % . A repeat study is now under way in Nepal , said Jacobs , who also hopes to do a study on the use of homeopathy in the treatment of ear infections . Meanwhile , the alternative_medicines branch of the National Institutes of Health earlier this year gave the first federal grant to study the effectiveness of homeopathy . The recipient was Michael Goldstein , a UCLA researcher and professor of public health . &quot; Supposedly , there were more applications for this grant than ever in the history of NIH , which shows there is a lot of public interest in it , &quot; said Goldstein , who plans to track the treatment of 130 adult patients in the care of five Los Angeles homeopathic practitioners for six months . &quot; We found that people who ' ve repeatedly ( sought ) mainstream medicine but have been dissatisfied , then turn_to alternative medicine. &quot; Homeopathy has been popular for at least 20 years on the Westside , where the evidence of alternative health_care includes underwater birthing centers , burgeoning midwife practices and the College of Homeopathy , which is in Santa Monica . In Santa Monica alone , there are an estimated 70 homeopathic practitioners , called homeopaths or homeopathics , who have received diplomas from homeopathy schools in the United States or abroad . Of the five Los Angeles-area pharmacies that specialize in the sale of homeopathic medicines , four are located on the Westside . And such chain drug stores as Thrifty and Sav-on are scrambling to accommodate consumers , offering popular homeopathic remedies for children ' s problems , including teething , colic , bed-wetting and coughs . Local pediatricians say that in the last three years there has been a decided increase in the number of parents asking that their children be treated homeopathically . The interest has grown as parents have learned about homeopathy at birthing centers , mother support groups , natural parenting groups , food co-ops or just in parent-to-parent conversations . With competition among doctors and hospitals especially fierce on the Westside , the local medical_community is going_to great lengths to meet the demand . Some medical doctors , for instance , have attended homeopathic colleges . Among them is Dr. Lauren Feder , a medical doctor who attended the_British Institute of Homeopathy three years ago . &quot; Parents that I see are saying that they aren ' t getting what they need from allopathic medicine , that they don ' t want another antibiotic , &quot; said Feder , whose Santa Monica practice serves both children and adults . &quot; Allopathic medicine helps the body suppress symptoms and blames outside causes rather than an internal weakening of the individual system for the problem . As homeopaths , we treat constitutional weaknesses and symptoms as_a_whole and stimulate the immune_system to fight_off ( disease and infection ) . &quot; That approach appeals_to people such_as Barbara Olinger of Venice , a mother of two who discovered homeopathy five years ago through a mother support group that grew out of the Venice Ocean Park Food Co-op on Brooks Avenue . Armed with stacks of books on homeopathy and container after container of tiny white homeopathic pills in her medicine_cabinet , she has put the practice to use . While on a camping trip recently with parents and children from the co-op , she passed_out homeopathic pills derived from poison_ivy . Though there was a great_deal of poison_ivy , she said , none of the children got rashes . &quot; Mothers in the group used ( homeopathic remedies ) and it kind of became a learn-as-you go kind of thing , &quot; said Olinger , who plugs homeopathy at support groups that she runs_for mothers at Santa Monica ' s YWCA . Like many who treat their children with homeopathic remedies , however , Olinger is open_to using conventional medicine . &quot; What I like about ( homeopathic medicine ) is it has no side_effects , like the diaper_rashes , digestive problems and diarrhea that come_with antibiotics , &quot; she said . &quot; In fact , I just cleared_up an ear infection my son had with homeopathy . But I am not totally against acetaminophen and antibiotics , because I had pneumonia , and when homeopathy didn ' t work , I used antibiotics. &quot; Leslie Neal learned about homeopathy from a friend who handed her a book about it after hearing Neal complain about a sore_throat that wasn ' t responding to antibiotics . Neal has treated her 25-month-old son , Luka , successfully with homeopathy for ear and upper respiratory infections . But when Luka got the flu , she visited her pediatrician , who told her to keep a close eye on her son . After waking from sleep , Luka ' s left eye area was swollen to the size of a golf_ball . Neal ' s pediatrician told her to rush him to the hospital . &quot; He had periorbital cellulitis , and it can travel_to the brain and kill them , &quot; said Neal , who lives_in Santa Monica . &quot; I said , ' Give him the antibiotics now. ' He was in the hospital for two days. &quot; * Neal said she is wary of antibiotics because she took so_much tetracycline for throat infections over the years that she has become &quot; immune to antibiotics. &quot; The drug also turned her teeth a dull gray , she said , prompting her to spend $ 10 # 000 for dental cosmetics . &quot; The reason I am attracted to homeopathy is so I am not dependent_on something that is destructive to your immune_system , &quot; Neal said . &quot; It also gives you some control over your own health . But I am kind of middle-of-the-road , half in Western medicine and half in alternative medicine. &quot; Others are more rigid users of pediatric homeopathy . They tend to use homeopathic practitioners who take a holistic approach to treatment . These homeopathics typically spend an hour or more with parents , learning about the child ' s symptoms and asking a seemingly bizarre range of other questions : Does she fear barking dogs ? Does she wake_up happy from her naps ? Does she like sweet , sour or spicy foods ? What does her sweat smell like ? Homeopathics say this allows them to treat a child ' s mind and body based on their unique set of symptoms and their constitution . Some of the most orthodox adherents of homeopathy shun Western medical treatment almost altogether -- and draw the ire of physicians who believe they unnecessarily place their children at risk . Dr. Robert Hamilton , a Santa Monica pediatrician and assistant clinical professor at UCLA Medical_School , acknowledges that there are medical applications for homeopathy . But he warns that there is also potential for harm . &quot; What if a child has a high fever and is taken_to a homeopath and he has meningitis , &quot; Hamilton said . &quot; That child might be diagnosed ( too late ) , which can cause visual or neurological damage. &quot; Another concern is ear infections , the second-leading ailment affecting children . &quot; About 90 % of kids will get_over their ear infections by doing nothing , &quot; said Dr. Harvey Karp , a Santa Monica pediatrician who practices conventional medicine but also advises parents on homeopathic remedies . &quot; Loss of hearing is rare and primarily caused from chronic fluid in the ear , not from acute infection . The caveat we give to patients , whether they use antibiotics or homeopathics , is to watch it for three days and if it doesn ' t get better , ( come_back to the doctor. ) &quot; Most physicians -- even many who see a role for homeopathy -- frown_on parents and homeopathics who refuse to vaccinate children because of fears that the potential for harmful side_effects from vaccines outweighs the benefits of the inoculations .</TEXT>
