   <HEADLINE> ITO MAY PENALIZE SIMPSON PROSECUTORS OVER DNA TESTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trading sarcastic and sometimes caustic barbs , prosecutors and defense_attorneys accused each other Tuesday of manipulating the issue of scientific tests in the O.J. Simpson murder case in_order to secure tactical advantages , and the judge threatened to exclude some DNA results if it turns_out that prosecutors delayed testing . Barry C . Scheck , the defense_team ' s principal DNA legal_expert , asked Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito to punish prosecutors for allegedly stalling so that a complete set of final DNA test results would not be available to the defense when a key hearing on DNA evidence begins later this month or in early November . &quot; This was tactical , &quot; Scheck said . &quot; We believe this was a purposeful effort. &quot; Lisa Kahn , the prosecution ' s chief DNA advocate , replied that defense_attorneys were deluging Ito with frivolous requests &quot; designed essentially to confuse and mislead the court. &quot; The only tactical maneuvering , Kahn said , was by defense_lawyers trying to disrupt the prosecution ' s right to test its own evidence . Ito took the defense argument seriously , however , and said he would rule Friday on whether to exclude some test results . &quot; If there is a purposeful delay , there ought to be a sanction , and the sanction will probably be denial of admissibility of this evidence , &quot; Ito said . That threat carries significant danger for the prosecution : If Ito rules_in favor of the defense , prosecutors could lose the right to introduce some blood samples that have been subjected_to DNA tests -- including tests that are being conducted on a bloody glove found outside Simpson ' s Brentwood home . The DNA tests are considered a mainstay of the prosecution effort , as authorities hope to use them to show that Simpson was at the scene of the crime and that he was cut_in a struggle with Ronald Lyle Goldman . Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson were killed June 12 , and Simpson has pleaded not_guilty to the double homicide . Rather than excluding any test results outright , however , Ito could decide to impose a deadline for test results . Defense_attorneys asked him to disallow any results obtained after Oct . 21 , and Ito mused about imposing a deadline to coincide with opening statements in the trial . Those statements are not expected until mid-November at the earliest . By then , prosecutors hope to have all their tests completed , so imposing a cutoff then might do little damage to their case . During Tuesday ' s hearing , Ito was clearly bothered that some blood samples were not forwarded to the DNA labs until mid-September , months after the investigation began . Based on that evidence , he said the defense had made a prima_facie case that there had been a delay in testing , and Kahn struggled to explain the reasons that prosecutors had not moved more quickly . Ito granted defense requests for access to some of the records Simpson ' s lawyers had sought regarding other work by the labs involved in the case . In general , Ito has turned_down defense motions , and at one point Scheck appeared surprised that the judge was ruling in his favor . &quot; I ' m going_to direct that it be produced , &quot; Ito said of the defense request for information about the DNA labs . &quot; So you won that one. &quot; From the opening days of the Simpson investigation , it has been clear that DNA tests would form an important element of the prosecution case . How many of those test results will be allowed into evidence will be decided largely by an upcoming hearing , and as that session draws closer , the two sides have become increasingly contentious . On Tuesday , the acerbic confrontation between Kahn and Scheck pitted two experienced and sharp-tongued DNA experts in a spirited , sometimes personal conflict . Both vigorously argued their cases , making no secret of their contempt for one another : There was eye-rolling and interrupting on both sides . When Kahn accused Scheck of filing requests intentionally designed to keep busy lab technicians from completing their work , Scheck stood next to her , shrugging his shoulders , shaking his head and holding_up his hands in amazement . Later , when Scheck suggested that a state_Department of Justice laboratory was conducting a kind of DNA analysis known as RFLP , Ito said he had not heard of any such tests being conducted there , and Kahn enthusiastically agreed . &quot; Maybe Mr. Scheck has some new information he can share with us , &quot; she said , grinning and staring at her counterpart . The spat peaked after Kahn accused Scheck and his legal partner of trying to do their own evaluation of scientific work . Scheck denied that and added that Kahn was continually mispronouncing his name . &quot; I ' m awfully tired_of the personality battle that ' s going_on here , &quot; Ito said in exasperation . &quot; It doesn ' t help me . . . . It annoys me. &quot; Ito did not rule on the request for sanctions on the DNA issue , but said he expected to take that up again Friday , when he has scheduled hearings on several other matters . Among them is a defense motion asking_for a special hearing on the &quot; source and purpose &quot; of leaks to the media regarding evidence in the Simpson case . In their motion , primarily drafted by attorney Alan Dershowitz and filed under seal , Simpson ' s lawyers state that &quot; false , distorted and misleading information has repeatedly been leaked to the media by members or agents of the police-prosecution team &quot; and that the release of that information &quot; constitutes a flagrant violation of the defendant ' s state and federal constitutional rights to due process. &quot; Simpson ' s lawyers also suggest that police might have gone beyond merely leaking information , and could have manufactured evidence . &quot; The motive for leaking false information is the same as the motive for deliberately manufacturing false evidence -- to help convict O.J. Simpson of crimes the police believe he is guilty of , &quot; the motion states . &quot; Indeed , now that the police have been criticized for leaking false information , they have an enhanced motive to make that false information turn_out to be true. &quot; Robert L . Shapiro , one of Simpson ' s lead attorneys , submitted a declaration along with that motion citing three news_reports that he accused police or prosecution officials of supplying . According to defense_attorneys , two reports were incorrect -- one that aired on KNBC stating that blood from a sock in Simpson ' s room had been genetically matched to Nicole Simpson , and a second that ran in Newsday asserting that DNA tests of a carpet from O.J. Simpson ' s Ford Bronco showed his ex-wife as the source of that blood . Shapiro also cited a third story , from The Times , stating that DNA test results of at least two blood drops found at the scene pointed to Simpson as the source . Shapiro did not contest the accuracy of that report , but accused police and prosecutors of leaking the information to The Times . If defense_attorneys can establish that police_officers or officials from the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office improperly supplied information to reporters , one remedy might be to allow the defense additional peremptory challenges to be used during jury selection , the motion states . Other possible remedies advocated by Simpson ' s lawyers range from excluding leaked evidence to giving jurors specific cautionary instructions to outright dismissal of the charges against their client . Jury selection in the celebrated trial will resume today as the first panel of prospective jurors returns to Ito ' s courtroom to be questioned about their knowledge of the case and their ability to serve impartially . That process is expected to be a grueling one that could last several weeks . At the request of news organizations , Ito has agreed to allow an audio feed from his courtroom to a nearby pressroom and to permit several pool reporters to attend the sessions . But Ito has expressed concerns that media might broadcast the audio feed , which would violate court rules against transmitting or photographing jury selection . In a rare appearance in the midst of a press corps with whom he has feuded in recent weeks , Ito toured the press area of the Criminal_Courts Building on Tuesday afternoon . &quot; The sound quality is excellent , &quot; the judge commented as a technician demonstrated to him how the system will work . Just as he prepared to leave the room , Ito was struck lightly on the head by a boom microphone that was being held_over his head . The judge took the accident in stride , smiling slightly but ignoring the questions hurled at him by the throng of reporters who have gathered from around the country for the trial . * BALANCING ACT : Sam Sheppard trial may hold a lesson for Judge Ito . B1 THE SIMPSON CASE . A daily update . Trial Highlights A look_at some of the key events in the O.J. Simpson murder trial Tuesday : * Summary : Lawyers for the prosecution and defense argued over DNA tests during the final court session before jury selection resumes today . * Court action : Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito ordered prosecutors to turn_over information regarding various DNA labs to the defense . He deferred a ruling on the defense request for sanctions against the prosecution based on alleged delays in the testing . Ito will rule on that issue Friday , and his decision could affect an array of items being tested to determine the source of bloodstains . * Outside the courtroom : Ito , who has attacked much of the news coverage of the Simpson case , toured the press area on the 12th floor of the Criminal_Courts Building . While there , the judge was accidentally bumped on the head by a microphone_boom , but he shrugged_off the incident good-naturedly .</TEXT>
