   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; THE INVISIBLE FOE ; URBAN ILLS COMBINE TO MAKE TUBERCULOSIS TOUGH TO BEAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Judy was recovering from a car accident , but doctors couldn ' t figure_out why she kept running a fever . Jennifer went_to_bed most nights feeling fine , then woke_up with a hacking cough . Fernando was just weary all_the time , and the rest of the family began feeling the same way . Until a_few years ago , many doctors might have prescribed lots of orange_juice and rest , writing_off this collection of symptoms as just another virus . But after four years of drumbeating by the Long_Beach Department of Health and Human Services , just about everybody -- from local physicians to the City_Council ; from social_service agencies to homeless people camped_out in city parks -- is finally becoming aware of an insidious , growing presence in the city . Judy , Jennifer and Fernando -- not their real names -- didn ' t have colds . Like hundreds of others in this city of 430 # 000 , they had tuberculosis , the debilitating lung disease that has been afflicting humans since the Stone_Age . The disease , thought to have gone the way of polio and scarlet_fever , is back in a big way in Long_Beach and other urban_areas . New TB cases in the city jumped more_than 30 % last year to 148 , an eight-year peak , while the number of cases throughout Los Angeles County was dropping about 12 % . In 1992 , the last year for which statewide records were available , Long_Beach was fifth in new tuberculosis cases per capita among California cities , after San Francisco , Oakland , Los Angeles and Santa Ana . In that year , there were 25.8 new cases for every 100 # 000 people in Long_Beach , and last year the number jumped to 33.8. Health authorities have watched with alarm the return of tuberculosis to Long_Beach like a haunting specter from the past . In April , 1990 , the City_Council declared a local tuberculosis emergency , making the city eligible for special state and federal funds . &quot; We were concerned that there might be a lot more cases unless we dealt with the disease aggressively , &quot; said Diana Bonta , director of the city ' s Department of Health and Human Services . Bonta ' s department beefed_up the city ' s tuberculosis clinic , sent city workers into the field to attack the disease at its sources and notified local physicians that they had to report new cases to the city . With help from the state and federal_government grants , Long_Beach is now pouring more_than $ 1 million a year into the prevention and cure of tuberculosis . The disease came as a big shock to some of its victims . &quot; I was absolutely dumbfounded when they told me , &quot; said one man , the son of a Midwest contractor . &quot; I remember when there were TB sanatoriums . My father used to remodel them , turning them into college campuses. &quot; It wasn ' t as if tuberculosis were anything new . Scientists have found evidence of the disease in 4 # 000-year-old Egyptian mummies . For centuries , tuberculosis patients were relegated to remote sanatoriums , often in mountain or desert locations , where afflicted lungs could presumably breathe cleaner air . The big medical breakthrough came_with the discovery in 1943 of streptomycin , the first drug to prove effective against the tuberculosis germ . By the 1960s , after even more effective drugs had been discovered , tuberculosis was in full retreat in America . In 1985 , the United States recorded its lowest number of new tuberculosis cases , 22 # 201 , since the Centers_for_Disease_Control began to keep track in 1917 . But homelessness , immigration from foreign disease centers , grinding poverty and AIDS have primed urban America for the return of tuberculosis as a major public health_problem , authorities say . The disease has been sweeping the country , increasing 20 % from 1985 to 1992 . The number of cases dropped about 5 % last year , according to preliminary figures released this week by the Centers_for_Disease_Control . Tuberculosis follows a slow , unswerving course , traveling between drug_users , AIDS patients , children and down-and-outers -- all with limited means to fight_back . It rarely affects perfectly healthy individuals who happen to come_into contact with a carrier , doctors say . For instance , none of the city ' s tuberculosis clinic workers , who deal with infected patients every day , have tested positive for the disease . &quot; It ' s not an easy bug to catch , &quot; says Barbara Lindsay , a public health nurse who coordinates the tuberculosis program for the city . &quot; It usually takes quite a lot of exposure to someone who ' s sick. &quot; But if a patient fails to take his medicine , which can render him non-infectious within a_couple_of weeks , he can spread the germs to other vulnerable individuals . The disease travels on droplets of moisture from coughs or sneezes , or even from singing , in crowded , poorly ventilated rooms . Tuberculosis saps victims ' energy and eats &quot; holes &quot; in their lungs , where protective cells called macrophages attack the germs , forming spongy clumps . In advanced cases , the germs move_into blood_vessels and attach themselves to bones , the brain or kidneys , causing blindness and skin lesions -- even sending victims into a coma . Most of the disease ' s victims were exposed years before the symptoms -- weight loss , night sweats , fever , fatigue and a stubborn cough -- ever appear , health authorities say . The rest are family members or others who live_in close proximity to the infected . In addition to the disease ' s physical effects , tuberculosis patients are often afflicted in other ways , Lindsay says . &quot; There ' s a lot of fear now , &quot; she said , explaining why most patients ask that their names not be divulged . &quot; There ' s all_of this tuberculosis around , and people don ' t understand how you catch it. &quot; Some patients who have been publicly identified have been evicted from apartments or fired because of the &quot; stigma &quot; of the disease , Lindsay said . The good news is that , even in the worst of circumstances , tuberculosis is curable . An array of new drugs can knock_out the germ , tubercle_bacillus , even when the disease is advanced . As a result , Long_Beach hasn ' t had a TB-related death in at least six years . But curing the disease requires a fastidious dedication to the treatment , the kind of dedication that is rare among substance_abusers or the economically deprived . Patients must take the prescribed megadoses of pills , up_to 22 of them at a time for periods of a year or more . Interrupt the treatment or stop taking the pills after a_couple_of months and the disease can come_back with a vengeance . &quot; The patient starts feeling better , and he says , ' I don ' t need to do this for six months , I ' m fine , ' &quot; said Bonta , the health and human services director . Despite often dramatic improvements at the start of treatment , however , the bacterium still lurks in the body . Let the tubercle_bacillus get_back on its feet and , like a boxer who has figured_out how to elude his opponent ' s uppercut after getting nailed a_few times , it can come_back stronger than before , health workers say . And this time it will be resistant to the drugs . There ' s only one way to fight this disease , medical authorities say . Aggressively . Pound it into the ground . Attack it with three or four medicines -- isoniazid , rifampin , ethambutol and pyrazinamide , sometimes all together -- and continue the therapy long after lungs heal and germs disappear . Dr. Matthew Locks of the city ' s tuberculosis clinic spreads three X-rays in a row on a table in his little examining room in the Health Department headquarters on Grand Avenue . They are successive pictures of the lungs of a 75-year-old man . &quot; You see , there ' s a big hole here , &quot; says Locks , pointing at an X-ray taken last October . On the right lung there is a circular shadow the size of a 50-cent piece . In the next X-ray , the shadow begins to be replaced with the milky white of healthy tissue , as the drugs begin to take_effect . In the final one , taken less than four months after the disease had been identified , the shadow is almost gone . &quot; The healthy tissue expands into the hole , &quot; said Locks , 75 , the former county TB control director who has been treating the disease since the 1940s . &quot; He ' s doing fine now . And so are his family members. &quot; So the elderly patient is cured ? Not by a long_shot . &quot; He still needs six or seven months of the drugs , &quot; Locks said . Long_Beach health workers take the same aggressive attitude in tracking_down the infected and making_sure they adhere to the treatment . &quot; This is not just a private health_problem , &quot; Lindsay said . &quot; It ' s a public health problem. &quot; City health workers approach the health of the community as if it were a forest during a drought . Neglect all_of the barbecue pits and campfires smoldering out there , let the wind spread their sparks , and the result can be a roaring conflagration consuming the trees , they say . The Health and Human Services building on Grand Avenue is barely a year old , but already the first-floor tuberculosis clinic is outgrowing its space . Some days the waiting room overflows with patients , new and old , and the nurses pass_out medicines like supermarket checkers dispensing groceries . The place percolates with activity . A staff of five medical professionals , two community workers and a clerk examine patients , dig_out information about others who could have been exposed and begin the challenging task of getting their commitment to cure the disease . When a patient does not show_up for an appointment , health workers such_as Graciela Espinoza get involved . &quot; If someone doesn ' t come_back , if they miss their appointments , the community worker gets_on the phone to find_out why , &quot; Lindsay said . &quot; They ' re bulldogs. &quot; If patients are persistently non-compliant , someone like Espinoza will go directly to their homes and watch them swallow their pills . Here ' s where those smoldering fires all_over town are kept under_control . Espinoza travels through the city with a container of medicine , tracking_down prostitutes and drug_users in flophouse hotels , trying to reason with a schizophrenic here , offering advice to a transvestite AIDS patient there . Espinoza , 36 , is a cheerful woman , but there is steel behind her wide smile and solicitous manner . Even the most resistant end_up popping pills into their mouths under her steady gaze . She finds Jimmy , an AIDS patient , asleep on the couch in a tiny house just west of Belmont Heights . Espinoza bends over the young_man and searches his face . &quot; You have some water ? &quot; she says , cupping his hand in her own and dropping pills into his palm . On the other side of town , Brad sits in a wheelchair in a bare living_room , watching a daytime talk_show on television . His daughter , Brenda , talks bitterly about Brad ' s health and about his drinking buddies . &quot; He had a stroke because of all_the pressure from his friends , and now he wants them to come and visit him , &quot; she says . &quot; I haven ' t had a drink_in a month , &quot; he growls . &quot; Not since I got_out of the hospital. &quot; Espinoza listens patiently and watches him take his medicine . Brad gives each pill a dubious examination , places it in his mouth and then , with excruciating slowness , chews it like a horse eating oats . There are a lot of reasons why patients fail to take their medicine , Espinoza said . Long_Beach is increasingly a city of immigrants , and the city ' s tuberculosis patients reflect it . More_than three-quarters of the city ' s tuberculosis victims are foreign born , many of them from Mexico , the Philippines and Cambodia , where TB rates are high . &quot; The perception is , ' What ' s the big deal ? ' &quot; Lindsay said . &quot; They say that everyone they know has a positive reaction ( to TB screening tests ) . Some even tell us they were born that way. &quot; Many of the foreign-born have more faith in folk remedies than in modern medicine , Espinoza said . &quot; People from the ranchos ( in Mexico ) have their curanderos ( healers ) , &quot; she said . &quot; Mostly they prescribe herbs . It ' s not enough to cure TB. &quot; But some patients fail to take their medicine because they are_on a course of self-destruction , inviting health_problems . &quot; We have a lot of alcoholics who , because of their drinking , don ' t pay too_much attention to their health , &quot; Espinoza says . When Espinoza loses a patient into the underground of Long_Beach ' s rootless and impoverished , she brings_in the health department ' s investigative services unit . Jeff Kingsbury , one of the nine field investigators who tracks_down patients with infectious_diseases , steps_in . An imposing Utah native with yard-wide shoulders , Kingsbury is a Health Department Joe Friday , following the lukewarm trails of the homeless and transients into shelters , cheap hotels and city parks . &quot; Pieces_of_paper , &quot; he calls the missing patients . For each , there is an order sheet with information on the most recent sightings and , if Kingsbury is lucky , a Polaroid picture . On this day , Kingsbury is looking_for a man named Bruce , an itinerate follower of the rock_band the Grateful Dead , who showed_up at the Long_Beach health department in January , asking_for medicine after he lost his bus_ticket to San Francisco . Kingsbury also is looking_for Jorge , a recently released jail inmate . If he finds either , he ' ll whisk them back to the clinic for testing and a dose of medication . But nobody remembers seeing the Dead Head in the tie-dyed shirt , and Jorge hasn ' t made an appearance at the city ' s shelters or assistance centers yet . The investigator is luckier in North Long_Beach , finding members of a tuberculosis-afflicted immigrant Filipino family at_home . The parents and two sons have submitted to the treatment , but two grown daughters , both of whom work full-time jobs , have failed to meet appointments at the clinic to be diagnosed . &quot; It ' s hard for them , &quot; the mother says . &quot; They don ' t get time_off during the day. &quot; But Kingsbury gets an assurance from her that the daughters will call him the following day and make arrangements to be tested . &quot; I could get a legal order against them , &quot; he says afterward , &quot; but it goes_against my grain . I think you can get a lot further if you show concern rather than threatening them. &quot; In rare cases , the adamantly non-compliant are arrested and placed in a closed clinic in the county jail , where they are forced to accept treatment . &quot; There was one ornery old_man who was consistently recalcitrant , &quot; Kingsbury said . &quot; Finally we said , ' Either take your medication or go_to jail. ' &quot; The man was eventually confined in the jail clinic for five months . It was only the second such case in the past three years . The city ' s ton-of-bricks approach to the disease may begin to pay_off in a year or two , said Bonta . &quot; we ' ll probably keep_on at the present rate in ' 94 , &quot; she said . &quot; Then we might start going down. &quot; Tuberculosis Cases In Long_Beach 1986-1993 1986 : 90 1987 : 68 1988 : 59 1989 : 128 1990 : 117 1991 : 109 1992 : 114 1993 : 148 Source : Long_Beach Dept . of Health and Human Services Tuberculosis Rates * Southeast Area Health Districts The tuberculosis rate has increased unevenly in the Southeast area -- even dropping_in some areas .
