   <HEADLINE> UCI AIMING FOR RANKS OF TOP RESEARCH SCHOOLS ; EDUCATION : CHANCELLOR LAUREL L . WILKENING UNVEILS HER LONG-AWAITED VISION FOR UNIVERSITY ' S PLACE IN 21ST CENTURY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a long-anticipated restatement of UC Irvine ' s academic mission , Chancellor Laurel L . Wilkening unveiled a sweeping plan Friday to propel the young campus into the ranks of the nation ' s top 50 research institutions by the year 2000 . To cope_with ever-looming state budget constraints that have dramatically sliced university funds in recent years , Wilkening will challenge her faculty to sharpen its focus_on obtaining research grants from government and the private sector . &quot; I want UCI to be the university of the 21st Century , and I don ' t think one exists right now , &quot; Wilkening said in a discussion with Times editors and reporters Friday . &quot; We can get a jump_on our competitors. &quot; Wilkening contended that the rededication to research will not come at the expense of the university ' s 15 # 000 students , who already complain that faculty_members are spending less and less time in the classroom . UCI cannot provide the attention of a small liberal arts college , Wilkening said , but &quot; the undergraduate program is a very strong program. &quot; However , she said that the issue of how to keep faculty_members in the classroom teaching while also increasing research has not been resolved . Wilkening said that few of her recommendations are controversial , adding that a UCI dean called them &quot; all motherhood and apple pie. &quot; But some programs are likely to be reshaped or reviewed at the 29-year-old university . Among them : * Wilkening ordered the elimination of the comparative culture program . * Wilkening will consider closing the physical_education department . * She recommended that interdisciplinary programs , such_as Asian American studies and Chicano / Latino studies , be placed within other departments . * Campus officials will consider making a project -- either independent research or a senior thesis -- mandatory for seniors . * Officials will also decide if communication skills , cultural diversity issues and computer researching skills should be injected into every major on campus . * Deans will be asked to review the cost and benefits of keeping_open departments that have fewer than seven full-time faculty_members . Her announcement about the future of the campus , and which departments will grow , ended a long summer of anticipation for members of the UCI community . Many have been looking_to her for direction on restructuring the university nestled in the grassy hills of Irvine . Two panels of UCI professors and administrators suggested in reports released earlier this year ways to make vast cuts_in academic and non-academic programs . They concluded that several departments , including the education_department , physical_education department and comparative culture program , should be closed . UCI ' s education_department was spared the knife in Wilkening ' s plan Friday . &quot; The department ' s emphasis on the use of technology in the classroom is progressive and is well-received by educators in the K-12 schools , &quot; Wilkening said in her report , adding that abolishing the department would be a great error . She also noted the potential for the education_department to obtain national grants for work with Orange County children . &quot; What the chancellor wants is for the departments to come_up with some innovative ways to go_about our business , which is hard to do when there isn ' t any money , &quot; said Juan Bruce-Novoa , head of the Spanish and Portuguese department . That lack of money from the state draws frequent sighs from members of the UCI community . Students talk_about taking full-time jobs to pay_for fees that have been increasing about 10 % each year . This quarter , they ' re up_to $ 1 # 444 at UCI -- a far_cry from the state Legislature ' s command 125 years ago that admission and tuition for UC schools be free to all California residents . Some staff_members are losing jobs as departments slowly pare expenses . About $ 10 million was slashed from UCI ' s budget this summer . And faculty_members note that their salaries were restored this year after a 5 % pay_cut last year , but that they haven ' t seen cost-of-living raises in four years . Wilkening said that during her first 14 months , she felt compelled to stay out of the debates about the campus ' future in_order to encourage discussion . &quot; I share a lot of the concerns the faculty has had , and I share some of the gripes about administration , &quot; Wilkening said . &quot; that ' s why we ' re making moves toward streamlining. &quot; UC President Jack Peltason -- Wilkening ' s predecessor at UCI -- praised her vision for the campus . &quot; We ' ve all had to re-establish priorities , think_about our goals and what we want to do , &quot; Peltason said . &quot; This is a very thoughtful report , one that makes_it very clear the campus has gone_through a lot of consulting and thinking_about the future. &quot; On the whole , Wilkening avoided the controversial closures of several graduate_schools that had characterized the painful contraction process a year ago at UCLA . Those who expected a major restructuring of UCI were left wondering what Wilkening ' s vision means in the long_run . &quot; There ' s no smoking gun anywhere in it , &quot; said one long-term faculty_member who asked not to be identified . &quot; A lot of people around here are going_to breathe great sighs of relief ; it ' s going_to be business as usual. &quot; Bruce-Novoa said he didn ' t expect big surprises in Wilkening ' s report . &quot; She has listened , she ' s had meetings , there ' s been no breakdown in communication , &quot; he said . &quot; People are not in a crisis mood. &quot; Instead of dramatic restructuring and cutting , Wilkening emphasized pulling more research dollars into UCI by encouraging contracts between campus researchers and Southern California biotechnical and biomedical companies . Her goal , published in a tabloid-size , eight-page newspaper distributed around the UCI campus Friday , is to shoot UCI into the top 50 research universities nationwide . She stressed that there are several subjects that major foundations are interested in funding in the post-Cold War era : biomedicine , children and families , the environment and international affairs , among others . To emphasize certain academic areas that have potential for attracting research and attaining excellence at UCI -- including biological_sciences , medicine , information and computer_science -- Wilkening said some academic disciplines might have to scale back in size . &quot; There may be shrinkage &quot; in the number of faculty in some departments , she said , declining to elaborate . In the future , some disciplines , such_as classics , for example , might have to share professors with other UC campuses , and students at UCI may take televised classes , she said . Some students were encouraged by the chancellor ' s high goals for the university , but worried about the emphasis on research . &quot; Her goal to put UCI into the top 50 is attainable , &quot; said Matthew Buttacavoli , an undergraduate who is_active in student government . &quot; My question is , if they can ' t find funding , will she sacrifice undergraduate programs or student services or student athletics ? &quot; Wilkening said she doesn ' t expect to see the campus cut its intercollegiate athletics , but she added that decisions on cutting student services will depend_on what students tell her during the upcoming year . &quot; What we really need is some creative thinking about how we do business here , &quot; UCI graduate_student Bryan Hannegan said . &quot; Can we do more with less , for more students ? &quot; Yushan Wu , 29 , a doctoral student in the East Asian languages and literature department , read the plan during her lunch . She said she understood the need to put resources into sciences but was concerned about the future of_her_own program . &quot; Our program needs a lot of nurturing and I hope we won ' t be neglected , &quot; Wu said . &quot; I think our program has a lot of potential. &quot; Comparative culture professor Raul Fernandez said closing his program would n ' t bother him if it were followed with the &quot; rational restructuring of ethnic studies. &quot; &quot; It doesn ' t have to mean it will be the end of ethnic studies , &quot; Fernandez said . &quot; It remains to be seen , but if the record is any evidence , it is going_to be an uphill battle. &quot; Comparative culture allowed undergraduate students to take courses about Asian American studies , African American studies and other subjects , and major in a comparative study of the areas . That will no longer be the case . Reaction to the change remains to be seen . But last year , more_than 100 student protesters occupied the chancellor ' s office to pressure UCI for more Asian American studies teachers . Prof . R . Bin Wong , director of Asian American studies , is awaiting the effects of Wilkening ' s plan . Because of limited money , some people worry that ethnic studies drain cash from other departments -- but he disagrees . &quot; We have not yet achieved the level of commitment and breadth of commitment to develop these programs , and we really need that , &quot; Wong said . Other students said they were skeptical about UCI ' s future . Incoming freshman Alexandra Rundel , 18 , of Laguna Beach said she fears the chancellor ' s vision will mean bolstering research programs and neglecting classroom instruction . &quot; I ' ve never supported this direction in the UC system , &quot; said Rundel , who plans to apply to Columbia University after one quarter at UCI . &quot; There ' s just an overemphasis on research instead of helping students , and that ' s the university ' s whole reason for being. &quot; Some UCI faculty disputed that fear , saying that better researchers make better teachers . &quot; Undergraduates will profit -- the quality of undergraduate education is a function of the quality of faculty , &quot; said Dr. Michael E . Selsted , a pathology professor and the university ' s top grant-getting researcher for 1993-94 . &quot; If you want to find a faculty_member who can be a superb teacher , show me a researcher , &quot; Selsted said . &quot; It ' s someone excited about the process of discovering new knowledge and who is invested in conveying that as well. &quot; UCI Ties Future to Research Chancellor Laurel L . Wilkening ' s plan to lift UCI into the upper echelons of the nation ' s research universities will require increased acquisition and spending of research and development funds . Five other UC campuses rate ahead of UCI . Research Ranking Here ' s how UCI compares to other UC branches that made_it into the top 100 for science and engineering grants . Figures , in millions , are for fiscal_year 1992 , the latest available , with national ranking : Los Angeles ( 6th ) : $ 202.8 San Diego ( 7th ) : $ 202.5 San Francisco ( 8th ) : $ 195.2 Berkeley ( 17th ) : $ 154.7 Davis ( 33rd ) : $ 90.5 Irvine ( 52nd ) : $ 63.1 Santa Barbara ( 65th ) : $ 49.1 Projected Spending Projected Spending If UCI is to move_into the top 50 universities in research expenditures it will need a 13 % yearly increase in funding during the rest of the 1990s . Here is where UCI stands compared to 50th place , along with projections for the duration of the decade . Amounts are in millions of dollars ; 1993-2000 are projections : 1992 : UCI : $ 89 50th place : $ 118 2000 : UCI : $ 237 50th place : $ 235 Personnel Movement Major shifts in the UCI staff have occurred during the past few months as the university has pondered its future .
