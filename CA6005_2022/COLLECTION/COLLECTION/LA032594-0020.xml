   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; LOW-BUDGET ' SUTURE ' A SCHIZOPHRENIC THRILLER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The black-and-white low-budget &quot; Suture &quot; is the first feature from San Francisco filmmakers Scott McGehee and David Siegel , who have won numerous prizes for several of their short films . It ' s a strange debut : technically assured and arty . The assurance is rare for a first feature , the artiness isn ' t . It ' s a psychological thriller without psychological depth . Clay Arlington ( Dennis Haysbert ) meets with his half-brother Vincent ( Arthur Towers ) at the funeral of their wealthy father in Phoenix . The brothers are supposed to share an amazing resemblance although -- and here ' s where the artiness comes_in -- Haysbert is black and Towers is white . The &quot; resemblance &quot; is a joke played straight ; it ' s also meant to clue us to the nature of identity , the mysteries of blood ties and all that jazz . When Vincent cooks_up a scheme to frame his brother for a murder he himself is suspected of , the result is something right out of Hitchcock by way of Wim Wenders : Clay , who survives an explosion and suffers amnesia , is mistaken for Vincent and surgically reconstructed to his brother ' s likeness . ( His post-surgical look is the same as his pre-surgical look . Go figure. ) Clay , with the help of a psychiatrist ( Sab Shimono ) , re-creates a new past for himself -- his brother ' s . McGehee and Siegel draw_on many visual and thematic sources besides Hitchcock and Wenders -- particularly the John Frankenheimer film &quot; Seconds , &quot; which was also about a man with post-surgical identity_crisis . And yet their style is distinctive . They bring a saving humor to this deadpan art piece ; they seem tickled by the idea of casting a black actor and a white actor as near-identical siblings . Yet they don ' t really explore the emotional suggestiveness in that casting , and so it ends_up as a kind of fancy in-joke for aesthetes . McGehee and Siegel are filmmakers from the eyes out ; they are drawn to the doubling imagery because of its emblematic rather than its psychological possibilities . ( In a film like Ingmar Bergman ' s &quot; Persona , &quot; we got both. ) They have such a strong and unsettling graphic sense that , without any psychological force , the film turns_into a kind of abstraction . It could stand to be a bit pulpier . Perhaps they were afraid that pulp would turn the movie into an extended &quot; Outer Limits &quot; episode ? The acting is mostly overemphatic and stiff , in the manner of grade D ' 50s sci-fi films , but with an ironic overlay . Example : The plastic_surgeon who falls_in_love with Clay , played by &quot; thirty-something ' s &quot; Mel Harris , is named Renee Descartes . that ' s the kind of joke that plays , maybe , once . Not five times . Still , McGehee and Siegel have the flair to bring something distinctively new_to black comedy once they shake out their art-film kinks . &quot; Suture &quot; is the archetypal &quot; promising &quot; first feature . * MPAA rating : Unrated .
