   <TEXT> It ' s a little wacky out there . A 300-pound inflatable crab bobs atop a Pasadena restaurant , its greedy pincers clutching -- what else ? -- soccer_balls . A Pas adena optometrist hawks World Cup souvenirs at a roadside stand . A bartender in Old Pasadena kicks more soccer_balls behind the bar than he spears olives with swizzle_sticks . But it won ' t be long before World Cup leaves town and life gets_back to normal ( until Jan . 1 , that is ) . Depending_on how you look_at it , the local World Cup spectacle is , whew , half over -- or , hey , only half-begun , with four games down and four to go . The monthlong international soccer tournament started June 17 in nine U.S. cities , including Pasadena , which will host the championship game at the Rose Bowl on July 17 . For local residents , the question has been not so_much which team is going_to hoist the 18-karat gold trophy but : What ' s the traffic like ? What ' s the economic impact ? What ' s the long-term benefit ? So far , the local impact -- giddiness , notwithstanding -- is hard to gauge . The business news so far has been mixed , and merchants are withholding judgment until the final week , when some are bracing for Super Bowl fever times infinity . But aside from a_few political flaps and traffic problems , most local authorities already are pronouncing the event a success , if only because the 40 law_enforcement agencies hunkered at their Rose Bowl command_post haven ' t had to handle marauding hooligans or bomb scares . &quot; We are very pleased with the first games , &quot; said Pasadena Police Cmdr . Mary Schander . &quot; We have ( four ) more to go , and they ' ll build_in intensity as we get closer to the championships. &quot; Each of the remaining game days poses a special problem : On July 3 , traffic is expected to be especially heavy because of the Fourth_of_July weekend ; on July 13 , the game starts at 4:30 p.m. , just as Wednesday evening rush_hour starts ; and on July 16 and 17 , the final games , tensions are expected to be high . Schander advised residents to avoid the freeways adjacent to the Rose Bowl on game days , especially two hours before starting time and 1 1 / 2 hours after the game ' s end . &quot; This is not a UCLA game or even a Rose Bowl game , &quot; said Schander , who has fielded hundreds of media calls since the World Cup began . &quot; It ' s bigger , and the duration is longer. &quot; * But whether the enthusiasm will translate into local dollars is another question . Merchants are unsure whether to believe a rosy USC study that predicts World Cup will bring more_than $ 523 million in business to Pasadena and the Los Angeles area . Some businesses -- such_as restaurants , bars and souvenir shops -- are going great guns , said Jack Smith , president of the Old Pasadena Business and Professional Assn . But for others , it ' s business as usual . &quot; You have to be realistic about why people come_to these events , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' re down here to have a good time . If they ' re from another country , they don ' t necessarily want to buy an armoire and throw it on a plane. &quot; Smith , who owns California Basket Co . in Old Pasadena , is among those whose business has not picked_up in response to the Cup . Still , he said , he ' s &quot; tickled to death &quot; that the World Cup is here and predicts a long-term boon from all_the publicity . Each World Cup game is expected to draw about 100 # 000 people ; the championship game alone is expected to draw 2 billion TV viewers . &quot; Any time you have a huge , world-class event seen by billions of people , &quot; Smith said , &quot; and it focuses_on Pasadena , people will say , ' I ' ve heard of that . It ' s a neat area. ' &quot; At times , the publicity has backfired . Media reports warning people to stay_away_from the Pasadena area on game days are hurting business , complained Michael Haddad , owner of West of Java , a furniture and accessory store in Old Pasadena . In fact , said Haddad , police are doing such a good job with traffic_control that thousands of visitors are bypassing Old Pasadena entirely . &quot; I think it ' s going_to be a disastrous month for us , &quot; said Haddad , who sat in his empty store , two hours before game time on a recent afternoon . And some of the publicity has put Pasadena in a bickering limelight . City officials feuded with World Cup authorities over Pasadena ' s family oriented soccer festival , Soccer Carnaval , and a World Cup sign at the Rose Bowl that said &quot; Los Angeles &quot; ; Pasadena officials eventually agreed to not hold the carnival on game days and worked_out an agreement to erect a separate Pasadena sign nearby . * Nonetheless , international visitors are seeing Pasadena at its best , all decked_out and spruced_up , like a high_school gym at senior prom . Several international visitors have remarked that Pasadena reminds them of a small European town , said Denise Nelson Nash , the city ' s coordinator for World Cup affairs . Tourists are so enthusiastic that the city ' s two information kiosks in Old Pasadena -- each stocked on game days and weekends with more_than 3 # 000 brochures on restaurants , special events and maps -- have nearly run_out of material , she said . &quot; I think people are taking_away ( the feeling ) that this is a very special community where you can feel at_home and a community that you want to come_back to , &quot; she said . The carpe diem mood is striking locals too . At Il Fornaio restaurant , regulars are wagering on World Cup games . On the lawn in front of John_Bull English Pub , optometrist Gail Murphy temporarily set_up a souvenir stand so she could get_in on the action . And at Wise_Guys bar in Old Pasadena , bartender George Alberto ' s playful soccer-ball kicks sometime knock_down plastic beer pitchers to the brick floor . One night , Colombian native Rafael Marin grabbed his video camera to tape Alberto ' s antics . * &quot; Beautiful , &quot; said Marin , a 52-year-old Miami pediatrician , his voice heavy with emotion . &quot; The blood is warming_up here. &quot; He slammed a fist into his hand . &quot; Now we ' re feeling like we ' re in the right place. &quot; Some say that spirits are so high that Pasadena can ' t help basking in the afterglow . &quot; It ' s a harmonic convergence , &quot; offered Frank Van Joolen , a 44-year-old Pasadena hospital orderly , his Netherlands World Cup cap snug on his head . &quot; The world ' s soul is here , right now. &quot; Others find local enthusiasm lacking . &quot; It ' s nothing like the Super Bowl or the Rose Bowl or the Olympics , &quot; mused Robert Dang , a 30-year-old production coordinator for a Thailand news crew . He struggled for the proper analogy , and then it hit him : &quot; I ' d say like another golf game. &quot; In fact , Dang said , for a Bangkok TV news_story , his crew interviewed people in Pasadena , Rosemead and El Monte to check_out the local response to World Cup . &quot; They ' re like , ' World Cup ? What is World Cup ? ' &quot; At Viva Pasadena , an open-air_market set_up for the games , sparse crowds have wandered through the 120 booths featuring crafts , souvenirs and food . A large Cameroonian contingent sat morosely at picnic tables for a ham-and-cheese sandwich lunch , lamenting the low-key atmosphere . * &quot; It ' s not big at all , &quot; complained Cameroonian fan Afata Andre , a 34-year-old professional drummer who wore a tattered San Diego Chargers cap . &quot; Four years ago in Italy ( at the World Cup games ) , it was so nice . Not like this . It was a party. &quot; But from a Pasadena perspective , the city put_on a whole new face to welcome the Cup . World Cup banners hang almost everywhere , World Cup trash_cans and ads dot what seems like every street ; even churches unfurl signs that welcome soccer fans . World Cup merchandise is sold at department_stores , grocery_stores and hotels , and at tables in the parking_lots of liquor_stores , bars and gas_stations . Kids trade World Cup pogs , fans wear T-shirts that boldly proclaim , &quot; Soccer is Life &quot; and residents buy the very local &quot; South Lake Avenue &quot; World Cup pins . High culture isn ' t immune to the World Cup bandwagon , either : the Pacific Asia Museum is exhibiting an Edo period scroll showing two boys playing soccer , and the Pasadena Pops orchestra will perform Saturday at Descanso Gardens in a musical salute to World Cup countries . Crowds are steady at the Armory Center for the Arts ' exhibition , &quot; The World of Cups , &quot; featuring cups in different art_forms commissioned from prominent artists ; visitors even dropped_by on a Monday , when the art_gallery was closed , said Torri Scott , marketing manager . Police have more_than doubled the number of officers on full-time foot patrol in Old Pasadena to a total of 25 during World Cup , Sgt . Jim Shear said , although problems so far have been mostly confined to a_few drunks . On foot patrol one night , Pasadena Police_Officer Ed Calatayud stopped in alarm when a man leaving a souvenir shop told him : &quot; There ' s a robbery in there. &quot; And then the man grinned : &quot; A jacket for $ 1 # 500. &quot; Crowds have been rowdy but good-humored , said Michael Vieyra , the doorman at Q ' s Billiard Club . &quot; This town has really come_alive , &quot; said Vieyra , 28 , watching a postgame crowd stream steadily by . &quot; It took me back to high_school when I used to go_down to Palm Springs , and people were going_up and down the street , screaming and waving . It was cool. &quot; Even residents who have to put_up with the traffic and noise are mostly good-natured about the disruption . Steve Bridges , president of the Linda Vista / Annandale homeowners association , said he has heard few complaints from neighbors . &quot; The neighborhood seemed very quiet except for the normal noise you associate with the Rose Bowl , &quot; he said . &quot; For having a major event like that , ( police ) did a very good job. &quot; In fact , in neighborhoods near the Rose Bowl , a_few residents turned entrepreneurs , hawking lemonade , hot dogs and other refreshments behind the backs of police who shut_down stands that lack business permits . Scott Davids , 13 , and a friend sold cold drinks out of their backpacks to fans walking to a game last week . They ' ve been averaging $ 400 profit a game but are unmoved by the whole spectacle . &quot; It ' s like any other day , &quot; Scott said . &quot; Cops close the street , people walk through , next day , it ' s all over. &quot; On a recent game day , resident Ray Brown stood across from the Rose Bowl in withering heat , trying to wave passing cars into his church lot , where the parking fee was $ 20 . Two hours after the game , the Rose Bowl was a darkened , empty shell , its end zone littered with empty water_bottles and film canisters left by photographers . Under a bright moon , the trampled field perked_up under the shower of giant sprinklers , ready for another day . What ' s Left ? There are four more World Cup games at the Rose Bowl : July 3 , Sunday : Round of 16 match , 1:30 p.m. July 13 , Wednesday : Semifinal , 4:30 p.m. July 16 , Saturday : Third-fourth place game , 12:30 p.m. July 17 , Sunday : Final , 12:30 p.m. What ' s Left ? There are four more WorldCup games at the Rose Bowl : July 3 , Sunday : Round of 16 match , 1:30 p.m. July 13 , Wednesday : Semifinal , 4:30 p.m. July 16 , Saturday : Third-fourth place game , 12:30 p.m. July 17 , Sunday : Final , 12:30 p.m. A Kick_in the Wallet So you decide to experience the World Cup on the cheaps , with a $ 25 ticket for the nosebleed section . Better bring some extra money . With parking and a_couple_of snacks , the price of your day will easily double . Here ' s a sample of prices that could leave your wallet as empty as Morocco ' s score sheet : * It ' s less convenient but more expensive : Parking at the Parsons Corp . shuttle lot in Old Pasadena costs $ 15 . The shuttle is free . But the Rose Bowl parking_lot costs only $ 10 . * Coca-Cola in World Cup souvenir cup goes_for $ 4.50. No such thing as free or reduced-price refills ; you just buy a new cup . Coke is only $ 3 in a regular cup , but the vendors for those are only in the stands and hard to find . * A liter of bottled water sells for $ 4 . You can bring your own bottle of water , but caps are not allowed , which leaves you the fun of keeping it from spilling . * A Big Mac , $ 4 * A can of soda costs only $ 1 from one of the kids selling them in the Rose Bowl lot from ice-filled garbage_cans . But sellers don ' t have permits . * If you passed_up the souvenir cup and want a memento of the experience , souvenirs range from $ 38 for a U.S. team T-shirt to an official World Cup soccer_ball for $ 195 ( the balls are available at Sport Chalet for $ 99. )</TEXT>
