   <HEADLINE> TELLING OTHER HALF OF THE STORY ; * AN AWARD-WINNING EXHIBIT ON THREE GENERATIONS OF JAPANESE AMERICAN WOMEN COMES TO LOS ANGELES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many of the first Japanese American women came_to the United States as &quot; picture brides , &quot; kimonoed women brave enough or desperate enough to spend a month at_sea to marry a man whose face they knew only from a photograph . Their daughters -- the generation known in Japanese as Nisei -- thought_of themselves as citizens like any other . But when the Japanese bombed Pearl_Harbor , thousands of Japanese American citizens found themselves robbed of their possessions and shipped off to harsh detention camps because of the color of their skin . The third generation , called Sansei , include women like Kristi Yamaguchi , who skated her way to a gold medal for the United States at the Albertville Olympics in 1992 . More_than 50 % of them marry non-Japanese men . &quot; Strength &amp; Diversity : Japanese-American Women 1885-1990 &quot; is the subject of an award-winning exhibit that opens Saturday at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Griffith Park . Based on interviews with 50 Japanese American women , the show was originally organized by the National Japanese American Historical Society and the Oakland Museum , where it opened in 1990 . In part because Japanese American soldiers , many fresh from the camps , fought so heroically during World_War_II , the story of Japanese American men has been told before . But as Rosalyn Tonai , one of the show ' s Bay Area organizers , points_out , this is the first exhibit that tells the story of Japanese American women , often in their own words . What distinguishes this show from other ethnic exhibits , even groundbreaking ones , is that , as it travels around the country , the show is customized to reflect the local experience . &quot; It was very different in Hawaii than it was in Portland , Oregon , &quot; says Tonai . Southern California has the largest concentration of Japanese Americans in the country -- more_than 130 # 000 in Los Angeles County alone . Working with the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo , the Autry has tapped this rich community resource to give the show a local spin . According to Michael Duchemin , curator of history at the Autry , the traveling portion of the show includes photographs , text -- much of it taken from the oral histories -- and some 70 objects that document the journey of Japanese American women from immigration to their varied roles in contemporary culture . The era of the picture bride , for instance , is vividly evoked by a kimono , iko or kimono rack and Japanese wicker suitcase that accompanied one hopeful woman across the Pacific . Local additions flesh_out the basic show and allow visitors to see in concrete detail how their Japanese American neighbors fared during almost a century of tradition , trial and change . Before World_War_II Japanese American women had even fewer job opportunities than their men . Many could only get jobs as domestic servants or at vegetable stands . But during the 1930s , some local Japanese American women attended the Gardena Dressmaking College . The show includes a photo of the class of 1936 , plus a diploma and a program for the ceremony that marked them as full-fledged seamstresses . * Inevitably , some of the most powerful material involves the notorious &quot; relocation centers. &quot; As a result of the racist exclusion order of 1942 , many Japanese Americans were , in the words of writer Eugene V . Rostow , &quot; sent to concentration_camps on a record which would n ' t support a conviction for stealing a dog. &quot; Locally , many internees were concentrated at Santa Anita , where children did their lessons in front of the parimutuel windows in the grandstand because their mothers didn ' t want their educations interrupted . According to Tonai , whose mother was a teen-age internee in Rohwer , Ark. , many people , however guiltless , were ashamed of being interned and never spoke about their camp experiences . The exhibit includes such eloquent objects as an oil_painting titled &quot; Family in Camp Room , &quot; done_in Rohwer , that shows how internees tried to brighten the small , barracks-like spaces where they suffered marriage-testing lack of privacy and other indignities . Bad , decidedly un-Japanese food was another trial of camp life . Internees in Topaz , Utah , finally rioted after they were served liver once too often . Somehow the internees , especially women , managed to create some beauty in their lives and those of their families . Hand-crafted jewelry is part of the exhibit , including a flower corsage made from little white shells at the Gila_River camp in Arizona . At the same camp Japanese Americans wove baskets in the style of the local Pima Indians . &quot; It looks_like the Indians may have been showing the internees how to make them , &quot; says Duchemin . The result is &quot; a very interesting cross-cultural piece &quot; that appears in the show . The stories of Nisei women are especially interesting because , even more_than their mothers , they were aware of being , in the words of writer Mei Nakano , &quot; in double_jeopardy , objects of the sexism of the society-at-large as well as the deeply entrenched one of the traditional Japanese society. &quot; As you look_at the pictures and read the words , you can almost imagine the parents of the Nisei women who became WACs and broke from tradition in other ways muttering the Japanese equivalent of oy veh . Activists are also part of the story , including the women who fought for redress and reparations for the victims of Executive Order 9066 . The show includes a Life magazine cover that shows civil-rights activist Yuri Kochiyama cradling the head of fallen Malcolm X . The exhibit also bears_witness to the achievements of contemporary women . Included in the show is a robe worn by Fumiko Hachiya Wasserman as a Los Angeles Superior_Court judge . As Duchemin notes , &quot; It brings the story up_to the present. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN What : Exhibit &quot; Strength &amp; Diversity : Japanese American Women 1885-1990 , &quot; Saturday through May 30 .
