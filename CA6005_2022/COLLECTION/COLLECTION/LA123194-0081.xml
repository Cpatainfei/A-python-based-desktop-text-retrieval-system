   <TEXT> Court Loss : A Rome court on Friday banned the sale of Michael Jackson ' s &quot; Dangerous &quot; album in Italy , after ruling that the American pop star ' s song &quot; Will You Be There &quot; had plagiarized a song by Italian singer Al Bano entitled &quot; I Cigni di Balaka &quot; ( The Swans of Balaka ) . Al Bano , whose light music has been played in Italy for decades , sued Jackson in May 1992 . The songs in_question were registered by Al Bano in 1987 and by Jackson in 1991 . &quot; Besides the differences in language and text , both songs appear identical , &quot; Rome civil magistrate Domenico Bonaccorsi said in a 13-page ruling . &quot; The similarity cannot be put_down to chance. &quot; The ruling gave both parties 120 days to make representations before the court decides on any further actions , including setting damages . Jackson ' s offices were closed for the holidays on Friday and his representatives could not be reached for comment . * Guilty Plea : Rap singer Lisa &quot; Left Eye &quot; Lopes pleaded guilty in Atlanta on Thursday to arson charges in conjunction with a fire that destroyed the $ 1-million mansion of her boyfriend , Atlanta Falcons receiver Andre Rison .

Evidence presented at the hearing indicated Rison had hit her just before the fire .

In the movie , Allen ' s ex-wife wants to give him her phone_number , and he quips , &quot; What is it ? 1-800-SPANK ME ? &quot; Dearth said she let the kids call the number on a family speaker phone , thinking it probably didn ' t exist . Instead they got a sultry woman ' s voice saying : &quot; Hi sexy ! You ' ve just connected to the hottest phone_line in America , brought_to you by American TelNet . Our one-of-a-kind service lets you choose your own phone fantasy. &quot; The phone message first told callers under 18 to hang_up , then described various 900-number sex lines and their fees . Disney spokesman Howard Green said the number in the movie was simply a joke : &quot; It ' s a fictitious movie . . . . If a real_number like that exists , it ' s coincidence. &quot; * Two Thumbs Up : Television ' s best-known film critics , Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert , have weighed in with their picks for the best movie of 1994 , and neither one has named Oscar front-runners &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; or &quot; Pulp Fiction. &quot; Both top their annual lists of the year ' s best films with Fine Line Features ' acclaimed documentary &quot; Hoop Dreams. &quot; Only three other selections made both critics ' 10 Best lists : &quot; Pulp &quot; ( rated second by Siskel and third by Ebert ) , &quot; Gump &quot; ( picked fourth by Ebert and sixth by Siskel ) , and Robert Redford ' s &quot; Quiz Show &quot; ( picked fifth by Siskel and 10th by Ebert ) .

STAGE Three-Week Delay : Stephen Sondheim ' s musical black comedy &quot; Assassins , &quot; which was scheduled to move within the Los Angeles Theatre Center from the 68-seat Theatre 4 to the 498-seat Tom Bradley Theatre on Jan . 20 , will now remain in the smaller theater through Feb . 5 , with the opening in the larger venue pushed_back to Feb . 10 ( preview performances start Feb . 7 ) . The delay was needed to accommodate changes in plans for the &quot; Assassins &quot; set , according to Peter Ellenstein , L.A. Repertory_Company managing director , who also directed &quot; Assassins. &quot; When the move was first announced , the company planned to simply modify the set but has since found that it must be completely rebuilt for the larger space . Ellenstein said the new set will maintain &quot; the same basic feel &quot; but will be &quot; showier &quot; and include new elements , such_as an added staircase and additional balcony . Because of the delay , the engagement ' s run has been extended three weeks , through March 5 . Affected ticket holders can obtain refunds or exchanges through Theatix . SHAUNA SNOW</TEXT>
