   <HEADLINE> NORWAY ' S MAGNETIC NORTH ; RENTING AN AFFORDABLE FISHERMAN ' S COTTAGE IN THE LOFOTEN ISLANDS , WHERE THE DRAW IS PRISTINE AIR , FRESH FISH AND MAJESTIC LANDSCAPES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You see the Lofoten Islands long before you get_to them . They stretch across the horizon in a massive , jagged rampart , trapping storms from the sea on their windward_side . We caught our first sight of them from an incredible spot on Norway ' s west coast , an old trading_post called Kjerringoy . My wife , Liet , and I were in the company of a bearded Norwegian , Karl Erik Haar , a painter of strong landscapes and seascapes , whose favorite subject is the islands floating in their ever-changing northern light . Haar is a distracted man -- always looking_to his side or over his shoulder through round-rimmed glasses , as he studies the light , even while he is talking to you . Some might think him rude , but I would not be able to focus my attention either if I were a painter exposed to a land like this , which seems continually to reinvent itself in the sudden shifts of the weather . For example , as we walked beside Haar around the trading_post ' s cluster of red , ocher and white board-and-batten buildings , a boiling , cloudy sky sent_down a shaft of silver light , threw a rainbow over a white church with belfry , tossed rain at us in wide-spaced drops that plopped and splashed into puddles left over from the last shower , then lifted like a theater_curtain and shone thin blue behind the distant islands , now themselves a dark , powdery blue . We had only just arrived in Norway ' s far north with a group of friends , and we were already dazzled . Our train had taken us over stony mountains , where waterfalls descended the steep slopes in narrow , ropelike lengths , through green agricultural valleys dotted with brightly painted houses of toylike charm , and up again , high into the mists . Well above treeline , at the most elevated point on the Trondheim-Bodo rail_line , we crossed the Arctic_Circle , which was marked by two small stone pyramids on either side of the tracks . At this latitude we might have expected the landscape ahead to be bleak . But the Gulf_Stream , flowing along the country ' s west coast , has a mitigating effect on the climate here , and soon we had evidence of this as the train whisked us away from the tundra and the fog , down through a series of lush farmed valleys . I am a fan of northern realms , drawn by the crisp , invigorating freshness , the clarity of the light and the purity of the air . And the Lofoten Islands ( pronounced LOW-fo-ten ) , an archipelago of more_than 500 square_miles that juts_out into the Norwegian_Sea , have all three -- and a whole_lot more -- to offer travelers searching for new horizons . Their mountain scenery is the kind that sets the heart to pounding . People who like to hike or climb will find miles and miles of trails through birch forests , moors and bogs . And bird-watchers will find about 180 species ; thousands of raucous cormorants , kittiwakes , auks and puffins inhabit the seaside cliffs . For those who enjoy fishing , there are numerous freshwater lakes , or a rented boat can take anglers out_to sea to hook any of the 110 different kinds of saltwater varieties , sometimes among seals and whales . To reach the first day ' s destination , the island of Vestvagoy , our party had to cross the Vestfjorden , the wide body_of_water separating the mainland from the Lofotens , and the scene of the annual cod catch that has been going_on here for several hundred years . The four-hour journey by coastal steamer from the modern port of Bodo began smoothly enough , but soon had us hurtling forward one minute and lurching sideways the next as the ship wallowed and pitched_in the waves . And no wonder : The Vestfjorden is famous for its Moskenesstraumen , or maelstrom , one of the strongest tidal_currents in the world . So renowned was it as a wrecker of ships and killer of men that both Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe included it in their works , Verne in &quot; 20 # 000 Leaques Under the Sea , &quot; Poe in &quot; Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque. &quot; Eager to escape the stuffy atmosphere of the steamer ' s salon , Liet and I went_up on deck to breathe_in the cold sea air . The closer the ferry approached the Lofoten Wall ( the local term for the archipelago ' s saw-tooth profile ) , the more the six large islands constituting it emerged as separate masses . And again I was struck how quickly -- and often -- the weather changes this far north . As I watched , angled wings of light from smoking clouds descended to the horizon , brushed a streak of glittering mercury on the sea , and turned the mountains alternately black , gray and green . Then , almost as quickly , mists wreathed the peaks and flowed down the slopes like dry-ice vapor . And where only moments earlier the sea had glittered , the water deepened to the color of hammered lead . * We spent the night at a hotel in the port of Stamsund . After feasting on grilled salmon and those little butter-yellow , deliciously earthy potatoes that northern farmers grow in dark brown loam , we went_off to bed . But since there is no real darkness in this realm of the 24-hour midnight_sun during summer months , we drew the drapes tight to shut_out the light . The next morning we boarded a bus charted by Leif Christoffersen , the Norwegian organizer of our little party , who , with his American wife , Becky , lives near us in Virginia . We were heading for the town of Reine , which lies two islands to the south . Liet and I sat_up front , across from the driver , a pretty blond woman in her 20s . As we stared ahead , viewing the scenery through an enormous front window , I felt as though I were watching an IMAX movie on a giant screen -- with some of the same heart-stopping action thrown_in for effect . The confident driver obviously saw herself as a master of the narrow road that over its 80-mile course links four of the six islands . She drove with disconcerting insouciance , using only one hand to turn the steering_wheel as we rounded curve after curve . And though Liet now seemed to be doing the driving , applying an imaginary brake with her foot whenever the fat-tailed sheep that clustered along the roadside seemed in danger of being hit by the bus , I decided to hand myself over to fate and enjoy the scenery . Not so_long ago , the only way to get_around in the Lofotens was by boat or ferry ; today they are linked by bridges and a brand new tunnel that runs from Vestvagoy under a broad channel to another island , Flakstadoya . The ride provided breathtaking views of broad , green valleys , blue lakes , perpendicular mountains and the omnipresent sea , and it packed a surprise as well : the sight of white-sand beaches . With turquoise water lapping them , they seemed curiously out_of_place in this cool northern environment . A long concrete bridge , only one lane wide , signaled the approach to the island of Moskenesoya and to Reine , regarded by many as the most beautiful place in Norway -- and we soon saw why . The town sits at the mouth of a fiord , its red , white and yellow frame houses strung_out across a peninsula and along the opposite shore . Rising steeply behind it are steel-gray , granite mountains ; in the upward sweep of their concave slopes they seemed almost draped against the sky . Here we would stay for almost a week . One of the Lofotens ' major charms is the uniqueness of its accommodations . The islanders have converted dozens of little fishermen ' s cottages , known as rorbuer , into self-service units . These provided shelter for the intrepid souls who in years past had seasonally ventured north in the hundreds to try their hand at cod fishing , a way to line their pockets with money when there was a good run . Some rorbuer can be quite plain , but most , like the one Liet and I were assigned with some of our friends , are delightfully cozy . Painted red on the outside with white trim , each of the cabins in our particular cluster had a sod roof -- an overhead meadow as it were -- sprouting bluebells and buttercups among the grasses . Such a thick blanket of earth , besides pleasing the eye , provides insulation against the cold and the wind . Our own cabin lay just over a rise . It stood rather precariously on pilings anchored to a granite ledge poking_out into the fiord . To one side , I could see new rows of wooden A-frame racks -- used by the locals to dry cod , a sign that tourism has not yet overtaken fishing as Reine ' s major source of income . Together with our four housemates , we explored the premises . A boatroom , with a tiny bedroom on the left , opened onto a large , pine-paneled kitchen , where two large windows offered silvery panoramas of the fiord . Just off the kitchen was the living room , perhaps the oldest section of the cabin , for the walls were made of thick , flattened logs , dark with age . Upstairs , squeezed under the roof , were two more bedrooms . Unpainted pine cabinets , tables , and low-slung chairs and couches created a welcome atmosphere , and we felt instantly at_home . By pre-arrangement , the rest of our companions -- who occupied equally snug rorbuer close by -- joined us that evening for drinks_in our cottage , which we had personalized with bouquets of pink fireweed picked just outside the front_door . And when the decibel level reached a din , we all went_off merrily to dinner in the local restaurant , the Gammelbua ( Old Store ) . I took an instant liking to this rustic , shadowy place , crowded with a hearty clientele . Warmth from an open_fire and the delicious cooking aromas emanating from the tiny kitchen followed us upstairs to the loft , where our group sat_down at twin pine tables illuminated by hanging lamps . At the far end , two whale ribs formed parentheses around a single window glowing with evening light . None of us had any problems selecting from the menu : tiny pink shrimp as a first course and local cod as an entree . By the time our party had finished eating , it was almost midnight ; but none of us had noticed the lateness of the hour because the sky still glowed . As we walked home under a canopy of motionless , sleeping clouds , gulls were flying about , mewing and crying , and wood smoke drifted on the air . * The members of our group had agreed to take the next day as it came . There were more_than enough activities for us to choose from . We could hire bikes or rowboats . Or , if we wished , we could charter a fishing_boat and go , quite literally , to Hell , an abandoned village , passing_through the maelstrom on the way . We could also sail to Vaeroy and Rost , smaller islands to the south , and take_in their bird colonies . Liet ' s and my pleasure was to wander around Reine and out into the countryside . The morning , which had begun gray and damp , turned suddenly bright and the town sprang to life . With the break_in the weather , the inhabitants came_out to weed their gardens , mow their lawns , paint trim , make home repairs -- though why all this was necessary I could not fathom since everything looked in perfect order to begin with . In addition to a meticulously kept garden , each house displayed blooming plants in its windows . Framed by snowy lace curtains , they suggested the coziness that must lie within , the antidote , I supposed , to gray , lusterless days when the storms roar in . On our meandering walk , we went_down to the harbor and found the doors to a warehouse wide open and ventured inside for a peek . It was stacked from floor to ceiling with dried cod , piled_up like firewood , ready for shipment . I expected a fishy odor ; instead , there was barely any , an indication of how effective is the process of drying the cod in air as clean and brisk as this . Several of our friends wanted to fish , and we joined them the following day for a trip in a small rented vessel , first motoring along the coast on a side trip to the Refsvikhula Cave . The cave boasts 2 # 500-year-old rock carvings discovered only a_few years ago . Putting into a quiet cove , we followed a narrow trail that hugged the steep slopes of the mountains , descended to a white-sand beach , and hopped from one huge boulder to another between which were snagged enormous logs that had drifted all_the way from Siberia . The 379-foot-long cave interior turned_out to be spectacular , carved into an almost cathedral-like space by the sea about 100 # 000 years ago , with aisle , transepts , nave and a soaring 165-foot ceiling . The carvings were a disappointment by comparison , stick figures that our guide ' s dying flashlight did little to illuminate . Later we reached a shoal where fish from deeper waters come_up_to feed . As we lowered our hand_lines over the railings , the sun , hidden much of the afternoon , suddenly came_out , filling us with optimism . Yanking gently on the lines , we could feel the fish bite . Liet caught 12 of them in almost as_many minutes , two sleek mackerel and 10 sei , or pollock . The wooden locker on deck was soon filled with our bounty , including several bright-eyed , white-bellied cod . It seemed wasteful to go_on catching more fish if we could not eat them all , so we pulled_in our lines . * Back in Reine , our group agreed to take turns cooking all this fish in a kind of progressive dinner that would occur over three nights in different cabins . The first belonged_to Leif and Becky and their Norwegian friends and cabin mates , Kaare and Metta . Metta prepared the cod in the traditional Norwegian way , bringing thick slices of the snow-white flesh to a boil in salted water , to which she had added a little vinegar , then cooked them for only a_few quick minutes . She served the steaming fish with a pitcher of drawn butter to pour over it , boiled new potatoes and a dill and cucumber salad . The snow-white cod could not have been more perfect , falling_into flakes at the pressure of a fork . But the surprise for me was the liver , which Metta had popped into the pot . I will admit to tasting it tentatively , fully expecting it to be as fishy as cod_liver_oil ; instead , it had a delightful , mild taste , almost like sweetbreads . If , in the unlikely event that our group had run_out of the fish we had caught , we could easily have bought some , as Liet and I discovered the next afternoon on another of our walks , this time across a bridge to the little island of Sakrisoy . After the long hike , we were glad to find that the local doll museum had a cafe , where the woman behind the counter had just made Norwegian waffles in a round iron divided into heart-shaped segments . We couldn ' t resist , and they came piping hot and egg yellow , with dollops of pale butter and big spoonfuls of raspberry jam . Marvelous . As we were sitting in the window , sipping the last of our coffee , we spotted the seafood market : a van , open at the back , with steps leading_up to it . Run_for the benefit of seasonal visitors like us , it belonged_to the local salmon farm and processing plant . We decided to have_a_look . Its clean-smelling treasures were spread_out on chipped ice , and among these were slabs of smoked salmon . The friendly woman in_charge must have seen me ogling the salmon , for she cut_off a generous slice and urged us to sample it . One bite was enough ; we could not resist the buttery consistency , the light smoke taste or the price , which was several dollars less than we would have paid at_home . We bought a whole side to share with our friends . To our consternation , it began raining , and neither of us looked_forward to getting soaked on the way back to Reine . When we asked the woman who sold us the salmon if there was a bus we could catch , she kindly volunteered to drive us home . She reassured us that she really was not going_out of her way on our account ; she had an errand to do_in Reine . With cod still a mainstay of the islands ' economy , some of us decided to make a visit to an open-air fishing museum at a village called , strikingly enough , A , pronounced &quot; awe. &quot; We journeyed there by local bus , along the rocky coast . One run-down building housed a pathetic collection of memorabilia , bits and pieces of the past , flotsam almost , that proved strangely touching . Here were the relics of a harsh , demanding way_of_life -- rusty hooks , splintered oars , coils of frayed rope . One wreck of a boat , typical of the kind used in the old days , showed how exposed to the elements the eight men who rowed it had been , and of course there had been no weather reports to warn them of sudden storms that often took a sad toll of lives . The open-air museum at A consisted_of 20 or so buildings clustered around a commanding manor_house , dating to 1864 , which once was home to the local squire . The squire ' s high standard_of_living derived from the fishery ; with the introduction of the potato and smallpox vaccine , the population in southern Norway swelled and the demand for fish to feed it grew apace . In 1896 there had been enough rorbuer in A alone to accommodate the 300 men who arrived each winter to participate in the fishery . * Not least of the happy challenges we met in the Lofotens was a climb_up one of the steep slopes behind Reine . Liet and I are not climbers , and mercifully this peak was gentler than most . Still , it required effort . Our entire group maneuvered upward , single_file , passing an eerie black lake , one of several created in the islands thousands of years ago by glaciers . After the ice began melting , the depressed land rebounded from the great weight that had lain upon it , and the arms of some fiords were left landlocked . To this day , their saltwater , called fossil water , still lies trapped at the bottom of the lakes . So wet was the moss underfoot , it actually squirted as we stepped_on it . But whatever effort went_into the climb , we were more_than rewarded when we reached the top . From there , we had a sweeping view south and could see , through tissues of clouds , the hulking islands of Vaeroy and Rost . But there was something else to delight us as well : a meadow filled with arctic cloudberries . This orange fruit the size of a large raspberry grows on the tundra at high elevations and is regarded by the Norwegians as an enormous treat . A rich source of vitamin_C , it used to be the islanders ' winter cure for scurvy , and the berry ' s high benzoic_acid content meant that the fruit could be preserved for months at a time without benefit of sugar . The plants stand only inches high , and generally hold a single berry each , which says something about the patience needed to gather a pailful of the sweet-sour fruit . On our last_day in the Lofotens , Liet and I remained housebound . And smart we were : The Lofoten weather put_on as fine a display of its ferocity as we had yet seen , one best observed inside . The wind howled and shrieked , the cabin shuddered on its pilings , the wind swept_up between cracks in the floorboards . A great clap of thunder startled us . Yet for all_the tumult , we were warm and cozy . We drank blueberry tea , ate milk_chocolate and talked_about how lucky we were to have seen this rare , unblemished part of the world . And then , as so often happens in the Lofotens , the storm ran_out of energy , the sun came_out , and a rainbow spread a long handle of color over Reine . GUIDEBOOK : North by Norway Getting there : The Lofoten Islands are in Norway ' s far north , above the Arctic_Circle , and the journey there is long . There are no nonstop_flights from LAX to Oslo , but SAS , KLM , Delta and British Air all fly there via connections in New York , Amsterdam or London . Current lowest advance-purchase round-trip fare is $ 1 # 088 . From Oslo , there is train service to Bodo via Trondheim , in the country ' s midsection ; the Trondheim-Bodo trip alone takes about 10 hours , but the scenery is spectacular . You can also fly directly from Oslo to Bodo ( about $ 275 round_trip ) , and take a 4 1 / 2-hour ferry ride to the islands ( about $ 40 one way ) , or fly from Bodo to the Lofotens ( about $ 95 one way ) . Where to stay : Simple fisherman ' s cottages , or rorbuer , range_in style from basic to very comfortable . Reine is considered the most beautiful location , and there ' s a restaurant close to the cabins ; in other locations , there may be no restaurants , and visitors must cook . Costs range from $ 100- $ 264 per cabin per night , depending_on number of bedrooms and amenities . A company that specializes in booking rorbuer stays is Borton Overseas ( 5516 Lyndale Ave . South , Minneapolis , Minn . 55419 ; telephone 800-843-0602 , fax 612-827-1544 ) . For hotel accommodations , contact the Norweigan Tourist Board .
