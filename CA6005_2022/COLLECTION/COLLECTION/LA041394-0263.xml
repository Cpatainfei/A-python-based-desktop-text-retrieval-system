   <HEADLINE> LOCAL ELECTIONS ; BURBANK SCHOOL BOND TRAILS IN EARLY RETURNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A $ 100-million bond referendum to rebuild Burbank public_schools appeared to be failing in early returns Tuesday night . With the absentee_ballots counted , the referendum was receiving less than the two-thirds majority it needed to succeed . The Burbank school_board , with the backing of the city , major employers and parent groups , pitched the $ 100-million bond referendum to voters , explaining that rebuilding the schools would cost the average homeowner a little more_than $ 33 a year . In the closing days before the election , the bond campaign swung into high_gear , with two phone banks totaling about 80 volunteers calling to make_sure that voters who supported the bond went_to the polls . &quot; We ' re confident that we ' ve done as much as we could have done , &quot; board President Elena Hubbell said before the vote . Those who oppose the bond referendum criticize the figures drawn_up by the district ' s financial experts and say that the $ 33-per-year cost on a home worth $ 101 # 000 -- the average property value in Burbank -- is based on overly optimistic assumptions of how much property values will grow and could cost taxpayers far more . At the center of the campaign is Burbank High_School , a cramped and haphazardly built facility with some buildings that date_back to the 1920s . The school needs to be rebuilt because of a poor design that gives few options to expand to accommodate overcrowding , and because of a deterioration faced by all_the schools in the district , school officials have said . John Burroughs High_School , also dating_back to the 1920s , would undergo major renovations , and every_other school in the Burbank Unified School District would be upgraded and modernized if the bond referendum passed . The schools have such problems as leaking roofs , falling tiles , poor lighting and sewage backup . Many classrooms have no air-conditioning and sometimes become so hot that computers shut_down . The school_board and district have put_together a $ 138-million plan to rebuild the schools , with $ 100 million coming from the bond referendum , another $ 23 million donated by the city of Burbank and $ 15 million coming_in state aid . But the school_board voted to go_ahead with the bond referendum because the $ 33-per-year cost for the average homeowner fit with the results of a survey taken_in June that showed that nearly two-thirds of voters -- the majority needed to pass a bond referendum -- would support rebuilding of schools if it did not cost them more_than $ 39 a year in extra taxes . * In other Los Angeles County voting , early returns showed Long_Beach Mayor Ernie Kell struggling for reelection in one of 50 local elections Tuesday , contests in which voters were weighing in on everything from school bonds and smoking bans to potentially historic reconfigurations of city_councils . In West Hollywood , there was the potential for the first gay majority on the council since 1986 , but early returns cast doubt on that prospect . Elsewhere in the county , there were numerous opportunities for ethnic_groups to attain or increase political power . But in one case , Monterey Park , final unofficial returns showed that voters decided not to make their city the first in California to have an Asian American majority on its council . Long_Beach ' s elections loomed significant because of what the results could say about the city ' s direction and because of the latest debate on smoking in public places . In the race for the city ' s top post , Kell , 65 , was bidding to remain the only mayor Long_Beach has known since voters began electing their top official in 1988 . However , with about 20 % of the vote counted late Tuesday , Kell was running fifth in a field of 13 . &quot; We ' ve had six good years . It ' s not the end of the world if we don ' t win , &quot; he told a supporter as the early returns were announced . Kell ' s well-financed challengers -- those raising more_than $ 100 # 000 -- were council_members Ray Grabinski and Jeffrey A . Kellogg ; former Long_Beach City College President Beverly O ' Neill ; redevelopment board_member Don Westerland and Belmont Shore businessman Frank Colonna . If no candidate won more_than 50 % of the vote , which given initial returns seemed almost certain , the two top finishers will meet in a runoff . Much of the campaign centered_on the need to stem crime , create jobs , unite the city ' s increasingly diverse neighborhoods and establish an international image for the city , which has seen its economy tumble as the Navy and defense_contractors have scaled back or closed . In other Long_Beach elections , two Latinas were making strong bids to become the council ' s first Latino members . In the 1st District , Jenny Oropeza , the first Latino elected to the Long_Beach school_board , waged a well-financed effort . In the 7th District , Tonia Reyes Uranga was considered a leading contender to succeed Grabinski , who is giving_up his council seat to run_for mayor . In the 3rd District , incumbent Douglas S . Drummond faced three challengers , two of whom decided to run after Drummond made anti-gay remarks during a conservative forum last fall . Drummond said gays did not concern him because they were dying from AIDS , and he supported Cuba ' s policy of quarantining people with the disease . Drummond later voted with the council majority to censure himself and offered an apology . Drumond took an early lead in the race . As in the mayor ' s contest , the two top finishers in each council race will meet in a runoff if no candidate wins more_than 50 % of the vote . Long_Beach voters also were deciding whether to ban smoking in all businesses used by the public , except in patio restaurant areas and in bars where up_to a third of the seating could be set_aside for smokers . Very early returns showed Measure K winning . Surprisingly , the measure has received little attention in a city where wars over proposed smoking bans have generated big news in years past . The council backed_down from a 1991 ordinance to outlaw smoking in restaurants after a petition drive financed by the tobacco_industry collected enough signatures to put the issue on the ballot . Last July , the council passed a less sweeping ordinance . Once again , a coalition of smoking interests launched a petition drive . So council_members , all nonsmokers , decided to put the issue before voters . In nearby Lomita , voters ousted council incumbents Robert Hargrave , Peter J . Rossick and Chuck Taylor . Times staff writers Ted Johnson , Ken Ellingwood , Duke Helfand and Richard Winton contributed to this story .</TEXT>
