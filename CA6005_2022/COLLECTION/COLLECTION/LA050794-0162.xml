   <HEADLINE> MICROSOFT FOUNDERS INVEST IN FIRM SEEKING AIDS CURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bill Gates and Paul Allen , the billionaire co-founders of Microsoft Corp. , have invested $ 10 million in a company that will use computers to find treatments for AIDS and cancer , officials at the company said Friday . Darwin Molecular Corp . said the investment by the two software tycoons is the start of a major fund-raising_effort for the biotechnology concern . The investment represents the second major project on which Gates and Allen have joined forces this year . In March they each invested $ 10 million in a Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp . project to develop a nationwide two-way personal communication_system . Microsoft contributed an additional $ 30 million to that project . While Allen stepped_down from any daily role at Microsoft in 1983 after he was diagnosed with Hodgkin ' s disease , he has been extremely active in recent months with his own portfolio of companies , focusing heavily on applications for the information highway . The biotechnology firm , based in suburban Bothell , Wash. , said it plans to develop treatments for AIDS , cancer and multiple_sclerosis through computer analysis of DNA sequence information , said Mark Pearson , president and chief_executive_officer of the company . Pearson said Darwin was founded in 1992 with $ 2.8 million in seed money and is now in a second phase of private financing . He declined to say how much money the company hopes to raise . Pearson said Gates and Allen were attracted to the biotechnology company through several personal connections , including work in molecular evolution done_by Dr. Leroy Hood , a professor at the University of Washington who holds a chair endowed by Gates . Gates also is a director of ICOS Corp. , another Bothell-based biotechnology company whose chairman , George Rathmann , is a founder and director of Darwin .</TEXT>
