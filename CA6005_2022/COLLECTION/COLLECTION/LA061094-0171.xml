   <HEADLINE> FEELINGS AND IMAGES ; ' EXPRESSIONS OF THE HEART ' PRESENTS THE EMOTIONALLY INSPIRED WORKS OF FOUR WOMEN AT THE NEW CANYON GALLERY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One can appreciate art without any explanation of its source or significance , but artists almost always have at least one story behind their work that could enhance a viewer ' s enjoyment and understanding of it . This notion is especially true of the four women who have brought their art together in the exhibit &quot; Expressions of the Heart &quot; at New Canyon Gallery in Topanga . Their inspirations and their stories are for the most part different . Yet the 60 works collectively reflect their shared belief that art is an expression of strong feelings . Judy Walker is &quot; trying to get_into very deep levels of the mind &quot; with her watercolors , she said , &quot; to express_emotions that might not be so pleasant. &quot; Among her works are three abstract self-portraits , one of a figure that conveys painful_sensations as it seems to be opening_up , screaming , splitting in two . The non-representational &quot; Barriers &quot; keeps one out with its dark tones and weightiness . The less dense &quot; Horizon &quot; suggests a lighter , more hopeful sense of being . Her &quot; Love Figures &quot; are pulled toward one another with a magnetic energy . Walker ' s watercolors are &quot; visual expressions of very sensitive states of being that arise from autism , &quot; she said . &quot; I think a lot of autism has to do with hyper-sensitivity , hyper-awareness . &quot; If I am to accept my full range of emotions , you cut yourself open_to undo the blocks . To get_through the inertia , you have to cut_through to the bone . With the release of feeling , you move to a peaceful place with great depth. &quot; Denise Barr ' s &quot; Shrine to Guadalupe &quot; holds her handmade jewelry , including crosses and bleeding hearts made of sterling_silver , brass and copper with beveled stones . A few pieces sport pictures of Mexican artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera ; many others present images of that country ' s patron_saints . Barr sees the cross and the heart symbols not specifically as religious expressions , but as symbols of the Mexican people and culture -- to which she feels a strong tie -- and the Mexican people ' s faith in themselves despite poverty and oppression . &quot; They take sanctuary in this object , and it helps them , &quot; she said . &quot; I like that a lot of ( the saints ) are women and that they are powerful , that they are caretakers . What they invest in her is what makes_it so fabulous . &quot; The symbols I use have a lot of power on_their_own . Nobody looks_at a cross and doesn ' t have a feeling about something. &quot; On a more playful note , some of the pieces present lyrics from popular songs of the past , such_as &quot; Stop in the name of love , &quot; &quot; Help me , I think I ' m falling_in_love again &quot; and &quot; When you wish upon a star. &quot; Barr sees her artistic work and that of her show colleagues &quot; as expressions of faith and hope that things can be better for a_few more people , animals and other living_things , &quot; she said . Six years ago , Barr and Linda Bolhuis started painting with dyes on white silk to make scarves . Bolhuis has continued to paint on silk , but besides making scarves , she also frames and hangs her images . Often , these paintings reflect her concern for endangered species . Two images here illustrate Topanga ' s beauty , but most of the others were inspired by a trip to Costa Rica in January . The jewel-like colors and luminous quality of dyes on silk contribute an unusually rich texture to the scarlet macaws and the lavender and yellow flowers of the painting , &quot; Laundry Day in Escazu. &quot; They help convey an otherworldliness to the bulls of &quot; The Ranch. &quot; Bolhuis ' bird , fish and iguana paintings are complemented by Jenny Stokes ' animal images on her pottery , which is &quot; never symmetrical , &quot; she said . &quot; I leave a lot of the bumps and joins to add more life , and to ensure the unique quality of each pot. &quot; Born and raised in Sri Lanka ( then Ceylon ) and of British background , she studied painting there . After coming_to the United States , she became fascinated with American_Indian pottery techniques , which she uses in her work today . Only recently has she begun to apply the painting skills she learned in Sri Lanka to her pots . Her earthy , variously shaped jars and bottles in the gallery , featuring exotic , colorful animal images , are &quot; a remembrance of growing_up in the East , &quot; she said .
