   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEWS ; POSADA ' S POLITICAL PASSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dancing skeletons , ruthless bandits , serene saints and rapacious politicians populate the raucous , multifaceted world depicted in the cheap broadsheets by Jose Guadalupe Posada ( 1852-1913 ) at Bryce Bannatyne Gallery . Before photography satisfied ( and stimulated ) modern society ' s appetite for sensational images of the news , Posada ' s prints illustrated stories , conveyed the gory details of natural disasters and outlined the back-stabbing viciousness of frontier politics . His etchings , engravings and occasional woodblocks also editorialized freely . Some were intended for poor Native_Americans and Mexicans who could not read , others were aimed at the literate . Both types regularly ridiculed the hypocrisy and greed of the privileged classes . Posada was a working-class artisan trained in the time-consuming process of lithography . After moving to Mexico_City in 1888 , he turned_to a little-known process of zinc etching that allowed him to turn plates out_in less than an hour . Speed was essential to keep_up with fast-breaking news_stories . Posada ' s popularity grew as his topical , timely prints appeared in newspapers , chapbooks and satirical weekly journals . He produced an estimated 15 # 000 images , many generic enough to be re-used whenever a publisher needed to illustrate another robbery , murder or government scandal . If anything unifies Posada ' s prodigious output , it ' s the restless , ribald humor of his ubiquitous calaveras , or skeleton caricatures . He did not invent these playful Day of the Dead characters , in which human foibles look petty in contrast to the mortality everyone shares , but his graphics popularized them . After Posada ' s death , Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco claimed him as an artistic forebear . The muralists saw , in his mass-produced images for non-elite audiences , a compatriot in their revolutionary struggle for a broad-based art that would define the needs and aspirations of a_people . Yet , it ' s impossible to read a consistent political position in Posada ' s prints . He poked_fun at all strata of society , mocking narrow-mindedness wherever it appeared . Also , many of the papers in which Posada ' s work was published were run_by the government and subject_to strict censorship . The politics of some of his pictures probably represents a balance between his own opinions and those of his bosses . He also appears to have been much more concerned with traditional religion than the muralists . A portrayal of Our Lady of Guadalupe is among his most elaborate prints . * Bryce Bannatyne Gallery , 2439 Main St. , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 396-9668 , through June 18 . Closed Mondays . * Empty Elegance : In the last five years , Claudia Matzko has made an impressive number of sculptures whose delicate beauty often takes your breath away . Ten new pieces at Angles Gallery disappoint because they do not live_up_to her earlier achievements . In the past , Matzko fashioned nearly invisible works_out of map tacks , monofilament , sheets_of_glass , traces of evaporated water and cast shadows . Exceptionally fragile , these meticulously installed materials almost disappeared into their surroundings . Just before vanishing , however , they sent a sensual quiver of energy through your body ' s perceptual machinery , stimulating your eyes , resonating in your brain and echoing in your memory . Matzko ' s best sculptures seemed to put viewers in touch with intangibility itself . Her precise art , which often had the presence of a science experiment , stripped abstraction of its spiritual residue , focusing instead on the poetry of empirical experience . Her new work replaces this eloquence with empty elegance . Fabricated from more substantial materials , such_as tooled_steel , cast bronze , industrial-strength electronics , broken musical_instruments and gallons of mineral_oil , it lacks the charge of previous pieces and seems static , even clunky by comparison . A stadium light_bulb whose cord is too short to reach the nearest socket has been suspended from the wall at eye level . If it were plugged_in , it would blind you . On the opposite wall , a series of hinges runs from the floor to the ceiling . Although they ' re meant to suggest that the wall can fold back , this idea never takes_on physical force : The hinges merely look_like a zipper or set of toy train tracks affixed to the wall . Matzko ' s new sculptures bypass your eyes to appeal directly to your mind . They don ' t explore the activity of looking , but elide sensory experience in favor of engaging the imagination and triggering abstract associations . Without its astute scrutiny of perception , Matzko ' s art loses its individuality and power . * Angles Gallery , 2230 Main St. , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 396-5019 , through June 11 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Intimate Anonymity : Dan McCleary lures viewers into his images by keeping himself out of the picture . At Kohn Turner Gallery , poignancy stirs just beneath the surfaces of paintings , drawings and photographs that patiently probe the territory where intimacy meets anonymity . The best painting is also the biggest . It depicts a woman waiting for an usher to tear her movie ticket . Nostalgia and romance are palpable in this seemingly insignificant ritual . Meaning resides in the details . The woman , whose back faces the viewer , stands unusually close to the usher . The tilt of her head and the angle of her eye suggest that she ' s giving him a pretty good looking over . His downward glance could be a bashful attempt to keep some distance between himself and her casual intrusiveness . Or , he might just be bored by his job and completely unaware of her gaze . McCleary ' s picture intimates that psychological worlds separate people whose bodies practically touch . Two other paintings , of a couple dancing and another lying on a bed , give vivid form to the emotional distance that can drift between individuals . The small still-lifes and portraits are less captivating but still possess some of the understated alienation of McCleary ' s more ambitious works . Ten color photographs serve as studies or sketches , freezing saleswomen at a cosmetic counter , a stranger at a bus_stop , a couple hugging and two men absorbed in conversation . Precedents for McCleary ' s paintings include Edward Hopper ' s stark depictions of urban isolation , Alex Katz ' s chilling portrayals of high-class vacuousness and Eric Fischl ' s uneasy images of suburban sexuality . More placid , restrained and subdued than these , McCleary ' s art is suffused by a touch of warmth , suggesting that withdrawal and distance provide their own security and comfort . * Kohn Turner Gallery , 9006 Melrose Ave. , ( 310 ) 271-4453 , through June 28 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Natural Progression : At Kiyo Higashi Gallery , a pair of previously unexhibited collages and five rarely seen paintings from the early 1960s neatly trace the rapid , step-by-step progression that led to Larry Bell ' s signature glass cubes , which secured his reputation as a founding member of the Light and Space group . Since 1963 , Bell has worked often with cubes , varying the size of his sculptures , refining his high-tech craftsmanship and playing with the ways different types of vacuum-coated glass catch and reflect light . To viewers familiar only with the cubes that have become synonymous with Bell ' s name , his early shaped canvases and collages come as a surprise . In retrospect , they make perfect sense . This small , well-selected survey concisely illustrates Bell ' s early movement away from the flatness of abstract painting and toward the three-dimensionality of actual space . In the collages , bits of broken glass look_like charming little pictures of clear skies . In the flat , hard-edged acrylic paintings , positive and negative space flip back and forth as silhouettes of cubes seem to describe volumes or merely outline six-sided shapes . Bell ' s biggest jump occurs in &quot; Ghost Box , &quot; a shaped painting that frames a central window of mirrored and sand-blasted sheets_of_glass . From here , it ' s easy to see where the cubes came from . They ' re basically paintings that have been taken_off the wall and had their stretcher bars deepened until they became armatures for the cubes . This taut exhibition captures the youthful , experimental component of Bell ' s oeuvre , when discovery outweighed refinement and loose_ends had not been eliminated in favor of highly focused reductions . * Kiyo Higashi Gallery , 8332 Melrose Ave. , ( 213 ) 655-2482 , through July 9 . Closed Sundays and Mondays .</TEXT>
