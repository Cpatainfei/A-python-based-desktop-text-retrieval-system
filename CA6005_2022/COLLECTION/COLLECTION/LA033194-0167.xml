   <HEADLINE> RIGHTIST ' S ANTI-SEMITIC REMARKS PROBED ; GERMANY : EX-NAZI MAY FACE TRIAL FOR SUGGESTING JEWISH LEADER HAS SPURRED RISE IN INTOLERANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German prosecutors launched a criminal investigation Wednesday of a far-right politician who suggested in the wake of last week ' s synagogue firebombing that certain Jews are themselves to blame for a rise in anti-Jewish sentiment here . Franz Schoenhuber -- a 71-year-old former volunteer in the personal guard of Adolf Hitler in the Waffen-SS and now leader of the rightist Republikaner party -- singled_out one German Jewish leader as &quot; one of those most responsible_for provoking anti-Semitism. &quot; A recent survey found that anti-Jewish feeling has risen somewhat over the past year in Germany , although respondents still generally prefer Jews to members of other minority groups . There have been attacks on synagogues and Jewish monuments since the reunification of the former East and West Germanys in 1990 ; another Jewish cemetery desecration was discovered Wednesday , in the Bavarian town of Pretzfeld . It is a crime in Germany to incite race hatred , but the case against Schoenhuber may still never get_to trial , much less result in a conviction . Some legal_experts say that by inciting hatred of a single Jewish leader , Schoenhuber is merely committing an act of personal slander and not the full-blown criminal offense of fomenting hatred against a racial or social_group . In addition , attempts to put Schoenhuber on_trial for any offense will be unable to go_forward unless he is stripped of the immunity that he enjoys as a member of the European Parliament . Schoenhuber is known in Germany as the first serious , effective leader for right-wing extremism in modern times . He founded the Republikaner party in 1983 , two years after publishing &quot; I Took Part , &quot; his controversial memoirs of his service as a Waffen-SS sergeant . Under his aegis , Die Republikaner became the first modern far-right party to win seats in any German legislature . Although Republikaner members still hold no seats in the federal Parliament , they have been represented in state and local legislatures in recent years , and the party receives official subsidies . Federal elections are to be held here in October , and many mainstream German politicians would like to rein_in Schoenhuber before his party can win any seats in the federal Parliament . Leaders of the major parties have called_for Schoenhuber ' s prosecution . But some analysts fear that a high-profile race-hate trial would only attract attention and sympathy votes to Schoenhuber and his party . In the past , Schoenhuber has tended to speak out mainly against foreigners . It has been only recently that he has changed his focus to Ignatz Bubis , president of the Bonn-based Central Council of German Jews , the largest Jewish organization in Germany . Earlier this month , for instance , Schoenhuber tried to file a race-hate suit of_his_own against Bubis , complaining that the Jewish leader was smearing rightists like himself . Bubis had earlier complained that right-wing radicals like Schoenhuber were the intellectual authors of neo-Nazi violence in Germany . &quot; Germans have had enough of Herr Bubis ' finger-wagging , &quot; Schoenhuber complained . Then , after last week ' s bombing of the synagogue in the northern German city of Luebeck , Bubis once again called Schoenhuber a &quot; mental arsonist , &quot; or one who gives ideas and ideological backing to neo-Nazis who actually carry_out such attacks . Republikaners held a rally two days later , where Schoenhuber said he had nothing to do with the firebombing and went_on to say that Bubis himself was promoting anti-Semitism . Bubis told Reuters news service that he would not dignify Schoenhuber ' s claims with a response .</TEXT>
