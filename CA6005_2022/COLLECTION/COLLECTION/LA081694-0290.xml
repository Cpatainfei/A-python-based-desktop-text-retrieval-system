   <HEADLINE> FAMALARO ' S LAWYER LIKELY TO DROP EXTRADITION FIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Arizona attorney for murder_suspect John J . Famalaro said Monday that he will likely drop a challenge to extradition proceedings , paving the way for the 37-year-old house_painter ' s transfer to Orange County to be tried in the slaying of Denise Huber of Newport Beach . Attorney Thomas K . Kelly said the decision to drop the challenge would likely come_by Aug . 29 , the date when the issue is scheduled to be argued in a Prescott , Ariz. , courtroom . &quot; I think this would make_it much easier for the state to move the case to California , &quot; Kelly said . &quot; We have no objection to this case being tried in California. &quot; The development comes as California authorities moved forward with proceedings that would force Famalaro ' s transfer to Orange County . On Friday , Gov . Pete Wilson ' s office began a review of the extradition papers signed by Newport Beach Municipal Judge Margaret R . Anderson . Wilson spokesman Kevin Herglotz said the extradition documents were still being reviewed Monday . Famalaro was arrested last month when Arizona authorities found Huber ' s preserved body inside a freezer in the driveway of his Prescott Country_Club home . The painter is accused of kidnaping and murdering Huber and then carting around her nude , handcuffed body inside the freezer . Huber , a UC Irvine graduate , vanished June 3 , 1991 , after her tire blew_out on the Corona del Mar Freeway as she headed_home from a rock_concert in Inglewood . Her parents and police launched a nationwide search , but Huber ' s whereabouts remained a mystery until Arizona law_officers found her body inside a freezer locked_in the back of stolen rental truck parked in Famalaro ' s driveway . Huber died from nearly a dozen blows to the head , according to an autopsy .</TEXT>
