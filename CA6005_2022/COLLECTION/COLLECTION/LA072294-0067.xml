   <HEADLINE> ARAFAT TELLS CHRISTOPHER OF PROSPECT FOR MORE VIOLENCE ; GAZA STRIP : PLO CHIEF SAYS SELF-RULE WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT $ 2.4 BILLION IN PROMISED AID .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During a Thursday visit by U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher to the newly autonomous government in the squalid Gaza Strip , PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat warned of increased violence unless international donors come_through with promises of $ 2.4 billion in aid to transform the Palestinian self-rule into reality . &quot; The Gaza Strip has arrived to the red_line of starvation , &quot; Arafat said at a news_conference , adding , &quot; This has to be changed. &quot; The humiliation and frustration of Palestinian workers , he insisted , has produced a &quot; very dramatic situation. &quot; On Sunday , two people were killed and almost 100 were injured in riots triggered by thousands of frustrated Palestinians barred from working in Israel . Unemployment in Gaza , home to almost 1 million Palestinians , is estimated to be nearly 60 % . In a move certain to create controversy in Israel , Arafat also declared Thursday that Israel has no right to invite Jordan ' s King Hussein to Jerusalem as part of the separate Israeli-Jordanian peace process . He said that right was reserved for him only as leader of the Palestinian people . &quot; It is my duty and my responsibility to offer the invitations to all my brothers and to all my friends to visit the holy_city , and the holy Christian and Muslim places in the holy_city , &quot; said Arafat , who wore his familiar drab green fatigues but not his trademark holster for the meeting with Christopher . Arafat then invited the Jordanian monarch to visit Jerusalem ' s Islamic shrines with him . His remarks triggered an immediate backlash . &quot; I didn ' t know that Arafat had a mandate over Jerusalem , &quot; said Foreign Minister Shimon Peres at a reception for Egypt ' s National Day in Tel Aviv . Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin was &quot; furious &quot; but refused to comment , according to an Israeli official . Arafat ' s statement also carried implications for Hussein , who considers himself the guardian of Jerusalem ' s holy_places . It was interpreted as a warning to the king not to unilaterally visit Jerusalem . Over the past year , the monarch gave $ 65 million to restore the historic facilities . But the primary focus of the trip by Christopher , the highest-ranking foreign official to visit since Arafat ' s arrival July 1 , was the Palestinian economic_crisis . After their 90-minute exchange , Christopher acknowledged that the new Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho faces &quot; a time-urgent situation . . . . Clearly , the Palestinians face a very difficult time here . It will not be easy for them , but I urge them to work_through it with determination. &quot; Christopher said he assured Arafat that the United States , international community and Israel all &quot; have a large stake in the success of this enterprise. &quot; But in blunt language , he also told the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman that the new government must show it can handle the loans responsibly and can account_for how donors ' money gets spent . He said they held &quot; sober and serious &quot; talks_about donors ' need for documentation . Part of the problem is that for more_than two decades , the PLO had a reputation of corruption and undocumented spending . But the new government also is still unfamiliar_with basic functions , from designing project proposals for aid to setting_up payrolls . Christopher was accompanied by Joan Spiro , the undersecretary of state for economic affairs , who will remain behind to advise the Palestinians on procedures to satisfy international donors and financial_institutions . The scope of the problem facing Arafat was visible as Christopher ' s delegation drove through Gaza . In stark contrast to the modern roads and buildings on the Israeli side of the new sandy border , even the main_streets of Gaza are littered with masses of garbage ; the walls here are covered with graffiti . Christopher entered through the Erez crossing where the riots erupted Sunday . After the session , Nabil Shaath , the Palestinian planning minister , told reporters : &quot; The euphoria has passed . Now is the time for action. &quot; Arafat praised the Clinton_Administration for its support . &quot; We have found a real friend in the White_House . It is President Clinton , and we are sure you will help us , &quot; Arafat said , telling the U.S. delegation , &quot; I ' m sure that with your help , we ' ll be able to touch the fruits of the peace. &quot; Christopher also held two rounds of talks Thursday with Rabin about efforts to find terms for peace with Syria . In Egypt earlier in the day , Peres said the peace process would not be truly comprehensive until Syria is included . &quot; We cannot leave any open wounds on the body of the politics in the Middle_East , &quot; he added . Since the announcement of a breakthrough between Jordan and Israel last week , the Israeli government has taken pains to make clear that it does not intend to isolate Syria from the peace process . Christopher will wrap_up his weeklong peacemaking effort with a stop today in Syria for talks with President Hafez Assad .</TEXT>
