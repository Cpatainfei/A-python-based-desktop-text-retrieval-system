   <HEADLINE> U.S. EXPECTED TO CALL FOR AIRTIGHT HAITI EMBARGO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration , joined by France , Canada and Venezuela , is expected to urge the U.N. Security_Council early next week to impose an almost airtight ban on trade with Haiti , substantially toughening a petroleum embargo that already has shredded the nation ' s economy , officials said Thursday . Officials of the United States and its three allies have concluded that the additional sanctions are needed to force the Haitian military to permit ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to regain the office he lost in a bloody 1991 coup . Although the four nations , collectively known as the &quot; Four Friends of the U.N. Secretary-General Regarding Haiti , &quot; threatened additional sanctions more_than a month ago , they have been reluctant to take the step because of the devastating effect the trade_embargo is sure to have_on the country ' s poorest citizens . But representatives of the Four Friends , meeting in Washington , decided late Wednesday that the additional measures are required to coerce the Haitian military and its commander , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , to stand aside and allow Aristide , the country ' s only democratically elected chief_executive , to regain power . Meanwhile , the Treasury_Department ' s Office of Foreign Assets Control froze the U.S. bank_accounts and other assets of all Haitian military_officers . The names of 523 officers were added_to a list of 41 individuals whose assets were frozen last October . But Treasury officials said the sanctions apply to all officers , whether or not they are included on the new list . In another step aimed directly at the military , the U.S. Embassy in the Haitian_capital , Port-au-Prince , announced Wednesday that the U.S._government has revoked the entry visas of all Haitian army_officers . A State_Department official said that the decision on new sanctions by representatives of the Four Friends must be ratified at the top levels of all four governments , a process expected to take several days . The official said that if all goes as planned , the four countries will ask the Security_Council early next week to ban all commercial trade with Haiti -- both exports and imports -- and to prohibit non-commercial airplane flights between the beleaguered country and the rest of the world . In effect , the plan would add the weight of the Security_Council to a trade_embargo imposed by the Organization of American_States only days after the September , 1991 , coup . The sweeping OAS embargo proved to be largely ineffective because it covered only countries of the Western_Hemisphere and contained no enforcement provisions . In contrast , a binding resolution of the Security_Council would include all nations and would be far more difficult to evade . The Security_Council banned trade_in petroleum and arms last November after Cedras and his supporters failed to keep an agreement , signed_in July on Governors Island in New York harbor , to restore Aristide to office by Oct . 30 . Although a_few leaks have occurred in the oil and weapons embargo , the sanctions have devastated the Haitian economy . Even the military and its affluent supporters -- generally immune to the rigors of the Caribbean nation ' s poverty -- have felt the impact . Nevertheless , U.S. officials conceded that the country ' s poor have been the hardest hit . Although the embargo excepts food and medicine , private relief organizations have had to curtail their efforts because of the fuel shortage . U.S.-based CARE International had to halt food deliveries for a month until it received fuel earlier this month from a special humanitarian shipment , the Associated Press reported from Port-au-Prince . The number of Haitians who got their main daily meal from CARE -- up_to 580 # 000 last year -- has plunged to 117 # 000 , said Chris Conrad , CARE ' s country director . &quot; We have very , very limited options right now , &quot; said Conrad , adding that some shipments resumed Wednesday . &quot; The more the crisis continues , the more limited our options are. &quot; U.S. officials said that a general embargo , although potentially more devastating in the short run , will increase the pressure on the military and should hasten the return of democracy .</TEXT>
