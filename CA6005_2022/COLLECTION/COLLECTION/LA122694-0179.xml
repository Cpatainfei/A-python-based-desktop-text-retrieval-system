   <HEADLINE> ROAD TO ENGLAND IS FULL OF SURPRISES ; SOCCER : EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP QUALIFYING PHASE NOT GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN AS SOME TOP TEAMS FACE STIFF COMPETITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The European Championship -- international soccer ' s second-largest event after the World Cup -- still is 18 months away , but if the qualifying phase is anything to go_by , there will be surprises aplenty in England in June 1996 . Already , the qualifying tournament has produced a series of strange results . Dec . 18 was a prime example . How else to explain Scotland ' s 1-0 loss to Greece in Athens , a result that put a sizable dent in the Scots ' hopes of reaching the finals ? And what about Germany ' s feeble performance during a 2-1 victory over Albania in Kaiserslautern ? &quot; that ' s like a defeat for us Germans , &quot; midfielder Matthias Sammer said afterward . Sammer ' s comments were mild compared to the extraordinarily insensitive remarks made by Germany ' s former World Cup-winning captain and coach , Franz Beckenbauer , a_few days earlier . &quot; When I think_of international matches , I imagine clashes with the great nations -- Italy , England , the_Netherlands , &quot; Beckenbauer wrote in a commentary published in the Bild newspaper . &quot; But at the moment we have to wait two years before we meet these soccer greats . &quot; that ' s why games against countries like Moldova are a slight to the German national squad . They ' re just stupid . &quot; Moldova , Albania , or whatever all these countries are called , should first play qualifiers , and only later face the soccer greats. &quot; Considering that Germany has managed only 1-0 and 2-1 victories over Albania during the current qualifying campaign , Beckenbauer ' s view seems well off target . It could also provide an added incentive for Moldova , which lost , 3-0 , to the Germans in Chisiniau but has to play them a second time . In the third match Dec . 18 , records fell_in Lisbon , where Portugal scored its most lopsided international victory by trouncing Lichtenstein , 8-0 . The Portuguese scored four goals in six minutes during one second-half spell . Their previous record victory was a 6-0 defeat of Luxembourg in 1961 during qualifying for the 1962 World Cup in Chile . Also in that game , Portugal ' s captain , Joao Pinto , become his country ' s most-capped player by appearing in his 67th international game . Portugal ' s neighbor , Spain , also is fast moving toward a place in the final 16 . The Spaniards scored a convincing 4-1 victory over Belgium in Brussels , a result that convinced Belgian captain Franky Van der Elst to retire . &quot; I had already announced that I would quit if things went_wrong against Macedonia and Spain , &quot; said Van der Elst , 33 , who played 69 games for Belgium over the past decade but was jeered by the Belgian fans throughout the Dec . 17 match . &quot; It ' s now virtually impossible for us to qualify , so I think it ' s time to give other players a chance . I ' ve had many good moments . . . one lousy game will not overshadow my international career. &quot; The Spanish , meanwhile , probably will reach the finals , having won all four of their games to date , as have the Portuguese . Belgian Coach Paul Van Himst , whose team had been tied , 1-1 , by Macedonia in its previous match , acknowledged the situation looks bleak for the Red_Devils . &quot; Theoretically , we still have a chance to qualify , &quot; he said , &quot; but it ' s a very slim one . &quot; Spain deserved to win . They have more talent than us . We lack the power and speed to match teams like Spain , Italy or Germany. &quot; Macedonia , which defeated Cyprus , 3-0 , in Saturday ' s other match , is second behind Spain in the qualifying group , but is likely to be overtaken before long by Denmark , the reigning European champion . The nine qualifying matches_played two weeks ago improved the prospects for the_Netherlands , European champion in 1988 , France and Bulgaria , among others . France , which will stage the next World Cup in 1998 , ended a string of three 0-0 ties by beating Azerbaijan , 2-0 , in Trabzon , Turkey , on goals by Jean-Pierre Papin and Patrice Loko . The French desperately needed the victory to stay in touch with the group leaders , Romania and Israel , and , as Papin said beforehand : &quot; If we can ' t beat Azerbaijan , we ' d better give up. &quot; Papin plays for Bayern Munich in Germany , where he evidently has been taking lessons in diplomacy from Beckenbauer , the club ' s president . The Dutch , meanwhile , gave departing Coach Dick Advocaat a rousing send-off by defeating Luxembourg , 5-0 , in Rotterdam . Advocaat , who led Holland ' s ' 94 World Cup team , surprisingly decided to step_down and accept the head coaching position at PSV Eindhoven . He leaves with a record of 15 victories and six ties_in 26 matches and with the confidence of knowing he can reclaim the national team job in the future if he wants it . &quot; With the national team , you play only eight times a year , &quot; Advocaat said . &quot; With a league club , you play every week , and that is a challenge. &quot; Gus Hiddink will take_over as the_Netherlands ' coach . Unbeaten Bulgaria scored a 3-0 victory over Wales in Cardiff , keeping it level with Germany in their group and all but mathematically ending Welsh hopes of reaching the finals . In other matches , Norway edged Malta , 1-0 ; Switzerland scored its first victory over Turkey in a quarter-century , winning , 2-1 , in Istanbul ; Israel and Romania tied , 1-1 , in Tel Aviv ; Finland overwhelmed San Marino , 4-1 , with striker Mika-Matti Paatelainen scoring all four goals in Helsinki ; and Albania lost to the Republic of Georgia , 1-0 , in Tirana . The latest series of qualifying games is the last for this year . The 47 nations seeking a place in the final 16 resume play in February . England , as host , is the only country guaranteed a place in the finals and preparations there are_well under way . More_than one million tickets ( priced from $ 24.50 to $ 213 ) went_on sale on Oct . 27 , and soccer officials are confident the 1996 finals will be the country ' s most significant sports event in decades . &quot; It is going_to be the biggest party in sporting and cultural terms since England hosted the World Cup 28 years ago , &quot; said tournament director Glen Kirton . &quot; We are determined to make_it a success. &quot; At least 40 % of the seats have been reserved for overseas fans . Stadiums selected to stage the three-week , 31-match tournament are Wembley in London , where the opening game and the final will be played ; Elland Road in Leeds ; Old Trafford in Manchester ; Hillsborough in Sheffield ; Villa Park in Birmingham ; St . James ' Park in Newcastle ; Anfield in Liverpool , and the City Ground in Nottingham . In preparation for the event , England will stage a four-nation mini-tournament next June , using several of the European Championship stadiums . In addition to England , the tournament will include world champion Brazil , Sweden , which finished third in World Cup ' 94 , and Japan . The schedule : June 3 : England-Japan and Brazil-Sweden . June 5 : Japan-Brazil . June 6 : England-Sweden . June 8 : England-Brazil . June 9 : Sweden-Japan . June 11 : Third-place game and final .
