   <TEXT> OK , I ' m reading Susan Kandel ' s art review over a cup of coffee ( &quot; Visions of Seduction , Repulsion , &quot; June 9 ) . I ' m sitting in the breakfast nook , my decidedly generous tush in a pair of decidedly generous rumpled sweat pants , my middle-aged bosom a lot farther south than in the accompanying illustration.The snide descriptives -- &quot; pathetic , &quot; &quot; absurdly bloated , &quot; &quot; less failures than mutants , &quot; &quot; overstuffed , &quot; &quot; with their massive thighs . . . ( they ) wholly elude the reach of the pornographic &quot; -- keep piling_up , and I ' m starting to wonder exactly what is being reviewed here : the artist ' s creative expression or the presumed prior gustatory offenses of the models ? I don ' t know much about art , but the pictured woman looks OK to me . I ' ve actually seen reproductions of some famous old pix of women who expressed a variety of body_types , many of which were not only considered erotic in the good old 15th Century but still somehow manage to stir men ' s souls today . A suggestion ( food for thought ? ) : &quot; Fat &quot; is not a pejorative , simply one of the Creator ' s many options . Look_around , Ms . Kandel : I ' m everywhere .
