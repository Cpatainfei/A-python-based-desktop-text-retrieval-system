   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN TROOPS STEP UP DRIVE TO CRUSH REVOLT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Army troops conducted house-to-house searches here Wednesday while the air_force bombarded suspected rebel strongholds in a push to crush a 6-day-old Indian revolt that has left scores dead and posed an embarrassing challenge to the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . As the rebels appeared to continue withdrawing toward the jungle-covered hills of southern Mexico , government aircraft circled above on search-and-destroy missions . Panicked residents fled their villages , and the government offered to negotiate with the rebels -- but only if they first surrender . In Ocosingo , scene of some of the heaviest fighting earlier this week , bodies lay_in the streets as troops hunting rebels kicked_in doors and rummaged through the town ' s lone Roman_Catholic_church . The insurrection -- the deadliest rebellion in this country in decades -- stunned Mexican authorities , who now appear embarked_on efforts to demonstrate they can regain control . For years , the Salinas government spent millions of dollars in a tireless campaign to hone the image of Mexico as a blossoming democracy , a country poised on the horizon of economic greatness , a reliable trading partner . In a_few short days , Mexican analysts say , that image was shattered by armed Indians demanding the most basic of concessions : land , a decent wage , humane living conditions , social equality . The &quot; New Mexico &quot; was suddenly reminded of its ancient reality , of the millions of Mexicans who still live_in abject poverty , of the plight of the descendants of the once-great Maya who have been left_behind in Mexico ' s quest_for progress . &quot; Mexican reality fell brutally on top of the imaginary country of the Salinas government , &quot; wrote columnist and economist Raymundo Riva Palacio in the financial newspaper El Financiero . &quot; The public appearance of an armed movement is a serious wake-up call_for a regime that has used decrees to make change. &quot; Salinas is now faced with the daunting mission of repairing the image of Mexico that he worked so hard to cultivate . He appears intent_on reassuring American politicians and investors , and on downplaying the violence as an isolated incident by people the government-controlled media refer to as &quot; transgressors. &quot; The challenge to Salinas ' authority comes just as the ruling political_party seemed guaranteed of an easy victory in this year ' s presidential elections , and it effectively upstaged the official Jan . 1 starting date of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , the centerpiece of Salinas ' policies . The Mexican air_force fired rockets into the rugged hillsides surrounding the picturesque town of San Cristobal de las Casas , according to witnesses and reporters . Armored personnel_carriers rolled in after the air strikes . Truckloads of troops rumbled through Ocosingo and over the winding roads here in Chiapas state , while others were used to evacuate frightened civilian residents . At last official account , 95 people have been killed since the rebels swept into six towns on New Year ' s Day , but the final toll is expected to be much higher . An estimated 12 # 000 troops -- one-fifth of Mexico ' s armed forces -- were participating in the attack . The rebels are thought to number between 1 # 000 and 2 # 000 . One of the rockets fired Wednesday fell within yards of a crew for the Spanish-language television network , Univision . Members of the crew , who were not injured , said their van was clearly marked as belonging_to the press , and the government promised to investigate . Salinas ' government Wednesday laid_out conditions for peace talks with the guerrillas , who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army in honor of revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata . Eloy Cantu Segovia , an Interior Ministry official appointed to represent Salinas in Chiapas , said in a communique that the rebels must agree to an immediate cease-fire , release any hostages and identify their leaders before talks can begin . They must also surrender all weapons and 3 # 000 pounds of dynamite they allegedly stole from the state oil_company . Chiapas , a lush but impoverished state that borders Guatemala , has witnessed years of conflict between the Mexican army and Indian peasants , who have long complained of economic and political isolation . Chiapas is controlled by political_bosses , often accused of corruption , who are loyal to Salinas ' Institutional Revolutionary Party . Reports of human_rights abuses , in which Indians are victims , have increased in the past six months . Government-controlled television Wednesday sought to emphasize the failure of the uprising to attract broader support from the residents of Chiapas state , but few analysts believe the problems exposed so dramatically by this week ' s events can be easily put aside . The government maintains that while inequities continue to exist , Chiapas has not been neglected and in fact received $ 750 million in aid last year , about 8 % of the budget_for social programs . Still , Chiapas remains the country ' s poorest region , where 30 % of the adults cannot read and 59 % earn less than the meager minimum_wage of just under $ 5 a day . Many analysts said the recent emphasis on NAFTA only underscored to Mexico ' s most downtrodden that they have been marginalized . The uprising seemed to raise questions about the true efficiency of the government ' s social_works program , a cornerstone of the ruling party ' s staying power . &quot; ( Salinas ) was leaving_office unscathed , going_down as the great modernizer of Mexico , and then Chiapas shows that his whole strategy may have been flawed , &quot; Mexican political_scientist Denise Dresser said in an interview . &quot; Salinas was creating a two-tiered country of the haves and have-nots . I think he made the conscious decision to propel half of Mexico into the First World , even if that meant propelling the other half into the Fourth World . . . . Now he ' s confronted with his Achilles ' heel. &quot; The violence flies in the face of the picture that Salinas has painted in trips the world over , a picture that clearly distinguished Mexico from the remainder of insurrectional , unstable Latin_America . &quot; Just when the government and the modern sectors it favors were proclaiming the transformation of Mexico into a member of North_America , from Chiapas came the resounding voice of armed insurgency , to remind us just how Central_American we are , &quot; wrote columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa , a frequent critic of the government , in the newspaper El Norte of Monterrey . The Mexican stock_market fell sharply when the Chiapas uprising was first reported , but it rallied Wednesday in a sign that foreign investors had not lost confidence in the Salinas government . &quot; For those who naively thought that in the aftermath of NAFTA , Mexico was free_of problems and challenges , this is a sobering reminder of significant social and economic challenges , &quot; David Beers , a senior credit analyst with Standard &amp; Poor ' s , said in a telephone_interview from New York . &quot; We haven ' t seen this in Mexico for a while , and whether it portends a more serious and persistent challenge to the government is something that remains to be seen. &quot; Darling reported from Ocosingo , Wilkinson from Mexico_City .</TEXT>
