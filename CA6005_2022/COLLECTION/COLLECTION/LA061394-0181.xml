   <HEADLINE> CHINA SIGNALS IT MAY NOT VETO U.N. CURBS ON N . KOREA ; ASIA : BEIJING WANTS TO PLAY ' POSITIVE ROLE ' IN NUCLEAR DISPUTE , JAPANESE FOREIGN_MINISTER TOLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Signaling that it might not veto proposed U.N. sanctions against North_Korea , China said Sunday that it intends to play a &quot; positive role &quot; in the U.N. debate over Pyongyang ' s alleged nuclear_weapons program , a Japanese spokesman said . During a meeting here Sunday , Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told his Japanese counterpart , Koji Kakizawa , that &quot; China is very much concerned about the present situation , &quot; a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said . &quot; China will participate positively in the discussions in the U.N. and is ready to play its own positive role , &quot; Qian reportedly added . He did not comment specifically on how China would respond to a sanctions vote . But Japanese reporters interpreted Qian ' s statements as a hardening of China ' s attitude toward North_Korea , a longtime Communist ally whose relationship with Beijing was once so close that the late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung compared it to &quot; lips and teeth. &quot; One of the five U.N. Security_Council members with veto power , China opposes proposals sponsored by the United States to apply sanctions against North_Korea , claiming that they would be &quot; ineffective. &quot; The Clinton_Administration is hoping that China will not exercise its veto to block the proposed sanctions , which could come_to a vote this week . Administration officials have indicated that they will seek gradual , phased-in sanctions against North_Korea , which has continued to defy international demands for inspection of its nuclear facilities . The plan for incremental sanctions , expected to be unveiled this week , might begin with stopping scientific and cultural exchanges and halting U.N. technical assistance . Stiffer economic sanctions might follow if the milder measures proved ineffective . On Sunday , Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert L . Gallucci insisted that the rough plan is not a sign of White_House backpedaling on foreign_policy . &quot; The policy is the same as it has been over the last year , &quot; Gallucci said Sunday on ABC-TV ' s &quot; This Week With David Brinkley. &quot; &quot; Over the last year , the Administration has been committed to the objective of getting North_Korea to forsake its nuclear_weapons program . . . and to make_sure that program doesn ' t end_up destabilizing a whole global non-proliferation regime. &quot; The aim of the phased strategy , he said , is to &quot; get the North_Koreans to agree that it ' s in their interest to avoid other outcomes which they may find uncomfortable or more painful. &quot; Gallucci stressed that the Administration has not backed_down from its belief that it is unacceptable for North_Korea to develop a nuclear_weapons program . And he said the Administration has not ruled_out the possibility of military_action if the North_Koreans do not respond to economic sanctions . He also said President Clinton has not given final approval for the proposed sanctions policy and that a final draft would have to be discussed with the United Nations and key allies , including Japan and South_Korea . A leading Republican senator criticized the proposed strategy , arguing that it is a form of appeasement . &quot; I agree ( that there would be ) terrible consequences ( from ) a conflict on the Korean_peninsula , &quot; Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) said on the ABC program . &quot; ( But ) I would suggest that we should also think_about the consequences of a delay and doing nothing until the point where North_Korea is a nuclear_power . . . . &quot; I would suggest the attempt to impose sanctions , and strict sanctions , first , &quot; McCain added . &quot; If that ' s not effective . . . then , yes , military air strikes would be called for. &quot; The meeting between Qian and Kakizawa on Sunday followed a series of consultations in China about the North_Korea dilemma . Last week , South_Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo visited China to try to dissuade Beijing from vetoing any sanctions resolution . According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman , Chinese officials have kept_in close contact with the North_Koreans on several official and unofficial fronts as the debate over Pyongyang ' s alleged nuclear_weapons program has mounted . The United States says North_Korea may already have one or two nuclear devices . North_Korea has insisted that it has no nuclear_weapons program and has repeatedly said it would view sanctions as an act of war .
