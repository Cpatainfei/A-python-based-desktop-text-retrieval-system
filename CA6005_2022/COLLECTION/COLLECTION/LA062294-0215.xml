   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; IN DEVELOPMENT ; BURN RUBBER AND RECYCLE TOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What do you do with old tires ? Turn them into planters or swings ? Use them for building material ? Grind them into powder for carpeting or rubber roads ? Think some more : There are about 2 billion whole tires in stockpiles and landfills throughout the nation , and another 240 million are replaced on autos each year . One answer is to recycle them as fuel . After all , the typical radial_tire is made largely of synthetic_rubber , carbon_black and other petrochemicals . Only 3 % of the tire ' s content does not contribute directly to its value as an energy source . Tire-derived fuel burns cleaner and hotter and has more_than 20 % more heating value than coal . Starting last month , a joint_venture among Los Angeles and Riverside counties , Mitsubishi Cement Corp . and a small company called Tyres began recycling tires to provide fuel for the kilns of the four major cement manufacturers in Southern California . Cement kilns , it turns_out , are ideal users of the fuel : The tire is completely consumed and becomes a part of the final product ; cement quality is improved , and the wire in the tire provides iron oxide -- a required raw_material . Finally , the sulfur is neutralized by the limestone used in the cement process . Sound and Slurry : Drying foods before shipping reduces freight costs and perishability . But a number of foods , such_as orange_juice , tomato_paste and corn_syrup , cannot be dried by conventional heat methods without using additives . Ingredients cooked at higher_temperatures also change the chemical nature of the product . A sonic dryer recently patented by U.S. Development Corp . and Purdue University scientists promises a remedy by substituting sound in the drying process . It relies_on pulses of intense low-frequency sound_waves that move relatively low-temperature air past the material . The end_product is a powder that is like the original product with only the moisture removed . However , the sonic dryer works best with very wet slurries , and it is not the most effective way to make beef_jerky . New Spin on Storage : Computer hard_drives , like closets , always seem to get full no matter how well you plan ahead . The problem is threatening to become worse as more information is digitized . But help is_on the way . IBM scientists have developed a sensor that will make_it possible to store nearly 20 times more data on a computer hard_drive . The new sensor , called a spin-value head , is five times more sensitive than today ' s best commercially available disk_drive sensors . That means it can read bits of data crammed more closely together on the same square_inch of disk surface -- in this case , a_billion bits ( a gigabit ) per square_inch . To write information on a disk , an electrical current sent through a coil induces a magnetic_field within the recording head that is projected through a small gap onto a spinning disk . To read the disk , the process is reversed . The reading process becomes much more difficult as the size of the gap narrows because it produces an ever weaker induced current , limiting the number of bits per square_inch . But the spin valve utilizes something called the giant magnetoresistive effect , which produces an electrical signal five times greater than the magnetoresistive sensors in today ' s disk_drives . A magnetoresistive reading sensor is made of several thin layers of a magnetic material that changes its electrical_resistance in a magnetic_field . The giant version is composed of even thinner film . This in turn means the sensor can read bits that take_up no more_than half a micron of space . Super Glues Put It All Together : The early Egyptians knew how to weld metals together . But they didn ' t have to contend with the advanced materials of today , such_as specialty glasses , intermetallics , structural polymers and composites . Because of their light weight and ability to withstand high_temperatures , these materials are increasingly being used in everything from aircraft and auto engines to advanced energy systems and chemical-processing plants . But joining them together is a challenge . A number of scientists are tackling that challenge . At Rensselaer Polytechnic_Institute in Troy , N.Y. , Robert Messler , author of &quot; Joining of Advanced Materials , &quot; is studying a process known as self-propagating high-temperature synthesis . Reactions to produce oxides , carbines , aluminides , silicides and other compounds are created between the pieces to be joined , frequently under pressure . As a result , melting and bonding occur , even in instances where bonding by other means was virtually impossible . At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , researchers have developed a glue that withstands higher_temperatures than conventional epoxies . The glue is made of cross-linked copolyester , molecules of oxygen and carbon that connect in chains . They can bond to other chains anywhere along their lengths , forming a stronger product than polyesters that bond only at either end . The glue will be important for a range of products , including grinding wheels and the next generation of supersonic aircraft . The aircraft , for example , would be subject_to temperatures of approximately 180 degrees Celsius . Conventional epoxies break_down at temperatures above about 150 degrees C .
