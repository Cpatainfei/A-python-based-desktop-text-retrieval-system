   <HEADLINE> A TREASURE_HUNT ; THE RAPE OF EUROPA : THE FATE OF EUROPE ' S TREASURES IN THE THIRD_REICH AND THE SECOND_WORLD_WAR , BY LYNN H . NICHOLAS ( ALFRED A . KNOPF : $ 27.50 ; 498 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Looting , for the last 40 centuries or so , has been the inevitable companion of war . From the sack of Troy to Napoleon ' s many appropriations of cultural goods , the conquerors have felt free to help themselves to whatever was most_desirable . That the Nazis , then the Soviets , should have done the same during the last world_war is no surprise ; but even so , the scale of this vast , highly organized thieving remains hard to believe . Now , in an admirably documented book , &quot; The Rape of Europa , &quot; Lynn H . Nicholas has set_out to give us a full account of who took what , and how . The result is a book which is at_the_same_time fascinating and horrifying . Uniquely , the looting began well before the war . Because the Nazis , who came_to power in 1933 , held that &quot; degenerate art &quot; must be suppressed , they demanded the removal of all such objects from the collections of the German museums , thus despoiling them of extensive holdings of Impressionist , Post-Impressionist , Expressionist and abstract works , along , of course , with anything made by a Jewish artist . Nor were the museums alone in being attacked by the new regime : the Jews soon found themselves not merely discriminated against , but exposed to confiscations of all kinds . So it was that the kind of large-scale , state-sponsored robbery which had , until then , been associated with military_campaigns took_place within the unbreached borders of a country at_peace with its neighbors . This made perfect sense to anyone who knew Hitler : A failed painter and designer , the boundlessly ignorant Fuhrer considered himself a connoisseur . That in itself might not have mattered as his taste ran to 19th-Century Academic mediocrities : any such work , taken from the national collections for the Fuhrer ' s residences , was hardly likely to be missed . Far worse , kultur was an essential part of his New Order . Thus , together with the reordering of public collections , Hitler established an ambitious acquisition program -- both for himself and for the Reich . Just how ambitious became clear with the takeover of Czechoslovakia and Austria : in both cases , these countries ceased to exist ; in both cases all Jewish possessions were seized ; as for the museums , they found themselves forced to make highly unequal exchanges when they were not altogether despoiled . That was only a beginning . The Nazi conquest of Poland did more_than give the Germans Lebensraum : All works of Germanic origin , like the admirable Veit Stoss sculpture altarpiece in Cracow , were simply sent to German museums ; other desirable pieces like the Leonardo &quot; Lady With an Ermine &quot; were taken by the Nazi General Governor Hans Frank or sent to the planned Hitler Museum at Linz ; and some , of course , were simply seized for a variety of Nazi dignitaries , Goering first and foremost . Although some small measure of legality was preserved in Austria , Poles , being Slavs , were officially considered to be subhuman . From the Nazi viewpoint , therefore , it was positively meritorious to take their possessions , and the man put_in charge of these robberies on the vastest scale was none other_than the cretinous Alfred Rosenberg , the Nazi theoretician and author of &quot; The Myth of the Twentieth Century. &quot; Still , it was not until July , 1940 , that , by Hitler ' s order , the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg ( Rosenberg Task_Force ) was created . Its mission was to seize all Jewish-owned cultural goods in the newly conquered countries of Eastern and Western Europe , while at_the_same_time forcing state institutions , the great museums first and foremost , to make &quot; exchanges &quot; that would redound to the advantage of Germany . Of course , that did not prevent plain old-fashioned looting . Nicholas cites an eyewitness who visited Poland in October , 1939 , for instance , and reported that &quot; the ruins of the Royal Palace in Warsaw had become a sort of open bazaar for German officials . Governor_General ( Hans ) Frank himself , on his first tour of the castle with a large entourage , had not set the best example when he tore the silver eagles off the canopy over a throne and pocketed them. &quot; That , indeed , was a typical scene . For the rest of the war , and in an area that eventually stretched from the suburbs of Moscow to those of Naples , the Nazis competed for the spoils , all_the spoils . Rosenberg ' s outfit , of course , had many rivals -- not just the military on the scene , but the Nazi leaders as well , in hierarchical order . First naturally , there was Hitler . Having decided to make the small Austrian city of Linz the cultural capital of Central Europe , he planned a vast complex of museums for which only the best would do , providing it was properly Aryan and Northern -- Vermeer and Rembrandt were high on the list . Many works of lesser quality were also included , however : neither the Fuhrer nor his agents knew much about art . There was , for instance , the totally incompetent Frau Dietrich . &quot; Her very special relationship with ( Hitler ) through Eva Braun is the only possible explanation for the amazing leeway she was given_in her dealings . Between 1940 and 1944 she bought some 320 paintings in Paris . . . . A lot of these were bad pictures , and no small number were fakes. &quot; The Reich ' s No . 2 man , Goering was no less greedy ; almost any famous artist would do . In the past , his lack of knowledge had led him to buy fakes and fifth-rate works ; now he found himself able to acquire famous paintings in great quantities , some from the Rothschild and other Jewish collections , others as &quot; gifts &quot; from leading European museums . And next in_line came the rest of the Nazi hierarchy . The result , as Nicholas points_out , was an unprecedented movement of great cultural objects . From every corner of Europe , trainfuls of paintings , sculptures , furniture , tapestries and silver rumbled into Germany . Then , with the German occupation of Italy , major museums , the Uffizzi first and foremost , were emptied out . If Nicholas had stopped right here , she would have written a fascinating book ; but because she goes_on to describe the eventual rescue of these artistic treasures from the ruins of the Reich , she adds a strong element of spine-chilling suspense . Almost as soon as the Allied troops breached the borders of Germany , they began to find caches containing everything from great libraries to Michelangelo sculptures and , in one case , the entire German gold reserve . Masterpieces were hidden in mine shafts and country castles ; some were properly packed , others just stacked , leaning_against walls dripping with water ; others , in the desperate days of collapse were simply taken by the local populations . Never before had a problem on this scale existed . As it was , neither the Americans nor the_British were at first prepared to deal with any of this . Happily , they soon caught_on , and men like James Rorimer , the future director of the Metropolitan Museum , worked long and hard to ensure the safety -- amid total chaos -- of a major part of the European cultural legacy . More amazing still , considering the eagerness with which the Germans had tried to destroy whatever they could not steal , and the justly felt resentment of their former victims , the Western powers broke the age-old tradition . Aside from perhaps unavoidable individual thefts , there was no mass-scale looting . The Soviets , however , took a different view : anything on which they could get their hands was sent_back to Russia . Amazingly , they returned much of it in the ' 50s : from the Pergamon Altar in East Berlin to the Titians in Dresden , much of the loot came_back to its place_of_origin . There are many villains in &quot; The Rape of Europa , &quot; and they include the greedy art_dealers who made fortunes from the catastrophe . There are also many heroes . Although some of the looted works have disappeared , most , today , are back where they belong -- a miracle we owe , as Nicholas points_out , &quot; to the tiny number of ' Monements men ' of all nations who against overwhelming odds preserved ( these masterpieces ) for us. &quot; And in the end , her book , too , adds something to them : As we see all that was so nearly lost , these great works_of_art , so fragile , once so endangered , take_on a special poignancy .
