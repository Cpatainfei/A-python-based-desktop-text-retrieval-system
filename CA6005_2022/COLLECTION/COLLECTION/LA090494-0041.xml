   <TEXT> Wendy Doniger ' s review of John Boswell ' s &quot; Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe &quot; ( July 31 ) captures the arguments and even the feel of the book . But she overstates a small part that goes_to the core of Boswell ' s case . She says : &quot; For the early church created a violent dichotomy between heterosexual marriage , in which sexuality was tolerated for the sake of children , and the priesthood , in which asceticism was idealized and sexuality entirely rejected. &quot; In fact , first millennium Christianity did not make such a &quot; violent dichotomy &quot; between sex and church , and that is one of Boswell ' s most important lines of evidence for same-sex unions . While early Christian thinkers considered celibacy and abstinence the highest state of spiritual devotion not only for those who practiced asceticism but for people getting_married , in actual practice , early Christianity was ambivalent , contradictory and unsettled about sex and relationships throughout the first millennium . * Local priests were allowed to marry . Not until the second_half of the millennium , were bishops not allowed to marry . * Marriage was considered a state function . The Christian &quot; blessing &quot; of even a heterosexual marriage was not performed regularly but done as a favor . * In this context , the Church performed &quot; blessings &quot; on any number of relationships : marriage , same-sex relationships , households , business partnerships , adoptions , etc . * Priests , however , were forbidden to have same-sex relationships &quot; blessed &quot; ( an indication that same-sex blessings may have involved sexual_relationships ) . Boswell argues that in a context of such sexual pluralism within Christianity and the culture at_large , same-sex unions appear plausible . The &quot; violent dichotomy &quot; between the Church and sexuality occurred in the second millennium when Christianity institutionalized heterosexual marriage as a sacrament , prohibited sexuality among clergy , marginalized blessing ceremonies and campaigned against women and homosexuality . JAMES CONN , Minister , SANTA MONICA John Boswell ' s consistent use of the terms Christian and Christianity where he really means Catholic or religious is misleading . It is a documented fact that the origins of the Catholic faith include the incorporation of rituals and practices common to the pagan_religions of the time . This would explain why Boswell ' s research discovered what seemed to be acceptance of homosexual relationships and the encouragement of chastity within marriage . Both behaviors find their roots in pagan worship and neither can be supported by Scripture . The Bible is very clear in placing sexuality within the confines of a heterosexual marriage . &quot; Marriage should be honored by all , and the marriage_bed kept pure , for God will judge the adulterer and all_the sexually impure &quot; ( Hebrews 13:4 NIV ) . Serious study into early church history will reveal that a body of true Christians existed in the shadow of the Catholic_church whose activities were characterized by a close adherence to undefiled Biblical teachings . Boswell ' s &quot; Christians &quot; were most likely not true Christians by definition , since they obviously did not understand nor follow the teachings of the New Testament .
