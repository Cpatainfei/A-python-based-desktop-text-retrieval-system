   <HEADLINE> ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PRISON FUNDING VOTED BY HOUSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prodded by Southern California lawmakers , the House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to require the federal_government to either repay state and local_governments for the cost of imprisoning criminals who are illegal immigrants or transfer them to federal custody . The reimbursement provision , added_to the House ' s version of the crime bill by a vote of 402 to 22 , would require the federal_government to deliver on a promise that has remained unfulfilled for eight years . Before it can become law , however , the Senate would also have to give its approval . Although the payments would not become mandatory until after 1998 , the chief sponsors of the measure said the Clinton_Administration is committed to spending sizable amounts_of_money before then to relieve financial burdens on California and other states with high numbers of illegal immigrants . California has projected that 18 # 000 undocumented felons in its prisons will cost the state about $ 375 million this year . &quot; This is an historic step , &quot; said Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) , a co-sponsor of the measure . &quot; We never got one cent before ( for imprisoning illegal immigrants ) , but now we ' ll get a decent amount and we ' ll build_on it. &quot; In another action aimed at controlling illegal immigration from Mexico , the House authorized expansion of the Border_Patrol by 6 # 000 agents over the next five years . The agency now has 4 # 100 agents . That provision , sponsored by Reps . Duncan Hunter ( R-El Cajon ) , Randy ( Duke ) Cunningham ( R-San Diego ) and Carlos J . Moorhead ( R-Glendale ) , would cost $ 921 million and would have to compete with other domestic priorities in the annual appropriations process . While the House ' s 417-12 vote of approval showed very strong support for expanding the Border_Patrol , a Senate crime bill -- which will have to be reconciled with the House version -- contains no comparable provision . Berman acknowledged that the Administration would oppose language in the prisoner-reimbursement amendment that would make the payments mandatory , contending the cost would be too high . But Berman and Rep . Anthony C . Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) said the Administration gave assurances that some reimbursement would be forthcoming , although they did not mention a specific amount . If the provision becomes law , the federal_government would have four years to pay the costs through the annual appropriations process . Starting Oct . 1 , 1998 , however , the provision would require full compensation to states and local_governments for imprisoning criminals who are illegal immigrants . Although the measure faces an uncertain fate when it reaches a Senate-House conference committee , it has the backing of Rep . Jack Brooks ( D-Tex. ) , the powerful chairman of the House Judiciary Committee . Los Angeles lawmakers hailed the reimbursement provision as a major advance in the long struggle to get the federal_government to pay part of the financial costs of illegal immigration that fall disproportionately on California , New York , Texas , New Jersey , Illinois and a_few other states . &quot; It ' s extremely significant , &quot; Beilenson said . &quot; This is the first time that , in fact , we ' ll be requiring , mandating , repayment by the federal_government of these costs to states. &quot; The annual cost of keeping a prisoner in California is $ 18 # 000 . The administration of Gov . Pete Wilson has projected the cost of housing more_than 18 # 000 undocumented felons -- or nearly 14 % of the state ' s total prison population -- to be $ 375 million in this fiscal_year . In Los Angeles County , the cost is estimated at $ 34 million per year . The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided that states are entitled to reimbursement for the costs of imprisoning illegal immigrants , but Congress has never appropriated the funds . In another development , the House approved the controversial Racial Justice Act by the narrowest of margins when a proposed substitute failed on a 212-212 tie vote . The measure , sponsored by Rep . Don Edwards ( D-San Jose ) , would bar the execution of prisoners who demonstrate that the death_penalty was imposed because of racial discrimination . Rep . Bill McCollum ( R-Fla. ) argued that the provision would nullify the decisions of juries and impose racial quotas for the death_penalty . Advocates of the proposal denied that it would impose quotas , arguing that it would instead tend to eliminate sentencing decisions based on race . Speaker Thomas S . Foley , who rarely casts a vote , sided with Edwards and rounded_up enough other supporters in a last-minute lobbying effort to save the provision . Under the legislation , Death Row inmates could use statistics on racial disparity to appeal their sentences . African Americans account_for about 40 % of the inmates executed since 1977 , the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund has found . Studies also have shown that criminals are far more likely be executed if their victims were white . Eighty-four percent of inmates put_to_death in the last 17 years had committed their crimes against whites . Racial discrimination was a significant factor_in the Supreme Court ' s 1972 ruling that overturned capital_punishment statutes . In the years since that ruling , however , most states have adopted new death_penalty laws intended to eliminate disparities in sentencing . The ultimate fate of the provision is uncertain because , again , the House bill must be reconciled with the Senate anti-crime legislation , which did not touch_on the issue . In other action on the crime bill , the House approved establishment of a police corps that would provide college scholarships in return for a four-year commitment to serve with a police_force , comparable_to the Reserve Officers ' Training Corps . The vote was 250-174 .</TEXT>
