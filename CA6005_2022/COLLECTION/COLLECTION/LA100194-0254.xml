   <HEADLINE> L.A. GROUP ASKS ARGENTINA TO JAIL FORMER NAZI OFFICER ; HOLOCAUST : WIESENTHAL CENTER OFFICIALS ALSO SEEK SPEEDY EXTRADITION . JEWISH LEADERS MEET WITH PRESIDENT MENEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Officials of the Simon Wiesenthal Center asked Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem on Friday to jail a former Nazi SS officer who is being held under house_arrest while he fights extradition to Italy , where he is wanted for war_crimes . Erich Priebke , 81 , found a haven in Argentina , where he has lived since 1948 . He has admitted participating in the execution of 335 Italian civilians -- including 75 Jews -- in March , 1944 , outside Rome . Priebke was arrested in the mountain resort of Bariloche , 1 # 000 miles south of Buenos Aires , after admitting his role in the Ardeatine Caves massacre during World_War_II . The victims were found shot in the back of the head , and Priebke confessed to shooting two , said Rabbi Daniel Landes , the Wiesenthal Center ' s national education director . Priebke ' s job &quot; was to bind the victims ' hands and to check them off as they were shot one by one , &quot; Landes said . &quot; He also carried_out Nazi orders to round_up Jews in Italy. &quot; Priebke ' s &quot; continued freedom mocks the memory of his victims , &quot; the Wiesenthal Center said in a letter handed to Menem . At a news_conference Friday , Menem , who is in Los Angeles promoting Argentina as an attractive economy for foreign investors , said he had not had an opportunity to read the letter from the Jewish leaders . He met Friday with 20 representatives from Los Angeles ' Jewish community , and the Priebke case did not come_up during those talks . Argentine judicial officials have favorably received Italy ' s request for Priebke ' s extradition , Menem said , but Priebke ' s &quot; defense has been delaying the case with various claims. &quot; During a May speech in Bariloche , a town with a large German community , Menem reportedly equated extraditing Priebke with a hypothetical extradition of former British Prime_Minister Margaret Thatcher . &quot; If the extradition of former SS Officer Erich Priebke is being requested on the grounds that the Jewish Holocaust was a war_crime , so was the sinking of the cruiser General Belgrano , and in that case Argentina should request the extradition of former British Prime_Minister Thatcher , &quot; the independent NA news_agency quoted Menem as saying at a news_conference . The sinking of the_Argentine cruiser during the 10-week Falklands War in 1982 claimed 323 lives among its crew of 1 # 093 . About 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis during World_War_II . The Wiesenthal Center letter to Menem said the organization is &quot; deeply concerned by the slow pace of legal efforts &quot; in connection with Italy ' s request to extradite Priebke . &quot; The local magistrate has agreed to the defense_attorney ' s request that all documents related to Priebke ' s actions in World_War_II be first translated into Spanish , &quot; the letter said . That tactic could take more_than a year , according to the letter . Jewish leaders applaud the moral leadership Menem has provided , especially in the wake of a bombing that killed nearly 100 people at a Buenos Aires Jewish community_center in July . In a speech Friday to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council , Menem said he had told Jewish leaders in Boston , New York and Los Angeles that Argentina is &quot; perhaps the only country where , after these attacks , we opened our doors to intelligence agencies from other countries. &quot; He noted that the American Jewish Committee has said Argentina has the least anti-Semitic activity of any country in the world . Authorities are hoping to find those responsible_for the Buenos Aires bombing as soon as possible , Menem said , &quot; but it is not an easy task. &quot; He reminded his audience at the Beverly Hilton Hotel that it took 22 years to track_down the last culprit in the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics . Menem , whose parents immigrated to Argentina from Syria , was the first Argentine president to visit Israel .</TEXT>
