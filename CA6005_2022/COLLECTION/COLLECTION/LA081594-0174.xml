   <HEADLINE> GOVERNMENT WANTS TO TEACH BRAZILIANS THAT IF THEY SHOP TILL THEY DROP , THEN PRICES MAY TOO ; ECONOMY : INFLATION TAUGHT CONSUMERS TO BUY FAST , BEFORE MONEY LOST VALUE . NOW THEY ' RE BEING TOLD TO LOOK FOR BEST DEALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Teresa Catramby , a 28-year-old assistant hotel_manager , wound through the aisles of blenders , stereos , sofas , comforters and other merchandise at a downtown store , it never dawned on her that a lot of powerful people around Brazil , even the world , are paying close attention to such consumer excursions . Politicians , business_leaders , foreign investors and others want to know if a buyer like this mother of two will look_at newspaper_ads before leaving home , buy a toaster without checking the price next door or pay high interest_rates to buy on credit . Many , most notably Finance_Minister Rubens Ricupero , are hoping that Catramby and her fellow consumers can quickly learn how to do something that is second nature to most Americans but that Brazilians haven ' t done for nearly 20 years : comparison shop . Just last week , Ricupero spent 10 minutes in a nationally televised speech lecturing the nation ' s 155 million residents on the art of shopping . &quot; Seek the lowest prices and the best-made goods , &quot; he said . He advised against making large purchases on credit . Whether Brazilians can acquire this skill in the next few months is a key factor_in whether the world ' s eighth-largest economy will be able to right itself , vanquish spiraling inflation and realize the economic promise that seemed assured 20 years ago . Brazil is embarking_on its sixth economic plan in eight years in its latest effort to conquer inflation , which has been running at more_than 1 # 000 % annually for years . Prices jumped 50 % in June alone . The country has changed its currency , exchanging the cruzeiro for the real , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar . The plan ' s success , economists say , is largely dependent_on whether the government can cap a burgeoning deficit and keep a tight rein on the nation ' s money_supply . Also vital is whether Brazil can switch from an economy in which price-gouging merchants lead consumers around by their noses to one in which savvy shoppers force retailers to compete for their dollars and thus keep prices relatively stable . &quot; Yes , we have to change the attitude of government , but we also have to change the behavior of merchants , &quot; said Amaury de Souza , a sociologist and political consultant . that ' s where Catramby comes_in . Over the years , as skyrocketing inflation caused prices to change monthly , weekly and even daily , the concept of comparison shopping was virtually eliminated from the Brazilian psyche . Consumers developed a &quot; buy now &quot; attitude , because prices were sure to go_up , not down . &quot; When you have very high inflation , you must spend very fast because your wages will be devaluing very fast , &quot; said economist Helio Portocarrero , a university professor . &quot; Shopping ( for the best price ) was simply too expensive. &quot; Consequently , market_analysts say , the corner merchant developed an almost monopolistic power over consumers that often bordered_on extortion . &quot; You ' d go_into a store and the salesman would say , ' You ' d better buy_it now because the price is going_to go_up tomorrow , ' &quot; said Paulo Levy , researcher for the government ' s Institute for Applied Economic Research . &quot; He was probably lying , but you never knew . So you bought. &quot; Merchants constantly hoisted prices , partly to adjust for inflation and partly because dizzied consumers could never get a sense of what products were really worth . &quot; I used to buy milk from a woman and I thought I was paying very little , because she sold it out of her home with no overhead , &quot; said Armando Castelar , assistant planning director for the state-owned Brazilian National Economic and Social Development Bank . &quot; Now , since the economy has stabilized , I realize that I was paying 25 % more_than the price at the market just downstairs . But I never realized that . If you asked me what the price of the milk was , I couldn ' t even tell you . Nobody knew the price of anything. &quot; Prices routinely rose at the beginning of the month , when the vast majority of Brazilians get paid . Consumers rushed_out and loaded_up on whatever they could afford . &quot; You had no choice , &quot; Catramby said . &quot; You would buy for the whole month and just store everything you could in the house . Everybody did_it . If you didn ' t , your money would be worth less the next week. &quot; Market equilibrium disappeared . Prices for the same product could double from one block to the next . That was before the July 1 introduction of the real . Since then , inflation has been at a standstill . The government has been trying to explain to Brazilians that they now have shopping options . Even before the plan went_into effect , Ricupero had gone_on television urging consumers to shop , shop , shop for the best prices . And when merchants parked prices at penthouse levels just before the currency swap , Mariangela Sarrubbo , director of a federal watchdog agency , suggested that customers boycott those stores . So far , consumer response to the new market conditions has been mixed . Customers are more price-conscious , merchants say . &quot; People are more careful with their money , &quot; said Carlos Roberto , manager of a medium-sized department_store downtown . &quot; They are looking_for sales . They are looking_for deals. &quot; &quot; Now people are going from store to store , &quot; said Peixoto Sousa , a linen and bedding salesman at another store . &quot; If they don ' t like our prices , they go_to another store. &quot; That has caused some merchants to become more competitive . &quot; We ' ve been spending a lot of time comparing our prices to those of other stores , &quot; said Ramone Neto , owner of a large fabric store that sells to both consumers and retailers . &quot; We ' ve been lowering prices to see if it will get more customers in the store. &quot; Jorge Cosenedey , co-owner of a notions store , hasn ' t lowered his prices , but he is making other concessions . &quot; See this bag , &quot; he said , pointing to hundreds of sewing pins bunched inside clear plastic wrapping . &quot; They sell for one real each . If you buy 10 , I ' ll sell them to you for eight reals . I didn ' t do that before. &quot; Nationally , prices have edged down about 1.5 % , according to government reports , and many stores are offering discounts of up_to 30 % . The cost of basic foods has fallen 5.7 % and would have declined more if two frosts in late June and early July hadn ' t damaged fruit and vegetable crops , government officials said . Overall , however , prices are still inflated and will fall further if Brazilians shop wisely , Ricupero said last week . The biggest transition for Brazilians , say economists and sociologists , will be learning to develop a long-term view of their buying power , holding_on to their money until they find the right price . That concept hasn ' t completely sunk_in . Jose Valentem , 62 , was browsing among stereo_systems at one store . He had been to five others already but had not considered delaying his purchase . &quot; It ' s the way I ' ve always done_it , &quot; he said . Maria Ester , 20 , a student , was looking_at athletic shoes . &quot; No , I really haven ' t changed the way I shop , &quot; she said . &quot; I just buy_it when I need it and try to get_the_best price that day. &quot; Merchants are taking_advantage of such attitudes by keeping prices high on big-ticket items such_as appliances , electronics and furniture but offering extended payment plans -- with exorbitant interest_rates . Their customers are actually paying more for the products now than they did before the new economic plan went_into effect . Under the 12-month payment plan , the cost of a blender goes from $ 34 to $ 90 , a $ 400 stereo to $ 1 # 200 . Yet people are loading_up . &quot; The client likes knowing that their payment will be the same every month , &quot; appliance salesman Evesio Silveira said . &quot; In the old days , you never knew what it would be because you had to factor_in inflation , which changed from month to month . So even though ( the price is now ) higher , people are buying. &quot; Unfortunately , says economist Portocarrero , many customers assume that because the payments are stable , they are getting a good_deal . &quot; Not everybody is very conscious about financial mathematics , &quot; he said , &quot; but I think people will learn over time. &quot; Some of the rush , Levy said , is the result of a pent-up demand for credit in any form . &quot; Under high inflation , you ' d buy things even if you didn ' t need them just to get_rid_of the money , &quot; Levy said . &quot; Clothes , groceries , small items . Many things you needed , you couldn ' t afford them . Now that you have this alternative , buying them in 10 or 12 installments , you can budget around that. &quot; Catramby thinks people will catch_on . She did . Catramby lived briefly in the United States before returning to Brazil six months ago . In her first two months in the United States , she said , she bought just as she had in Brazil , rushing_out with each paycheck to load_up on groceries . &quot; But then I saw that ' s not the way you do_it , &quot; she said . &quot; You wait for_sales . You use coupons . You go and buy what you need , but you hold_back some money and then you come_back the next week when the prices are maybe better . It just takes time to adjust. &quot; A Price Comparison The median individual income in Brazil is $ 266.50 a month , compared to $ 1 # 650 for the United States .
