   <HEADLINE> CANCER CENTER TAKES ITS SKILLS TO RURAL VIRGINIA ; ONCOLOGY : IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE PROGRAM HAS SAVED ABOUT A_MILLION MILES OF TRAVEL FOR SUFFERERS , WHO MUST GO TO RICHMOND ONLY FOR SUCH HIGH-TECH PROCEDURES AS RADIATION AND BONE-MARROW TRANSPLANTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some days , nurse Connie Deagle ' s job means chatting with Tamara Tuttle ' s daughter Susie about her favorite movies while her mother visits the doctor . Other times it means helping to administer a complex form of chemotherapy through a patient ' s spine . At night Deagle ' s job as coordinator of Rappahannock General Hospital ' s oncology clinic means taking calls_at home from patients with questions about their cancer treatments . The clinic at the 76-bed hospital is one of four cancer outreach partnerships that the Medical College of Virginia ' s Massey Cancer Center in Richmond has established at small hospitals in the state . Deagle , 39 , who has lived_in nearby Middlesex all her life , and her counterparts at the other clinics provide the human link that doctors at Massey say makes the project function effectively . &quot; They know more about the individual patients than I do , &quot; said Dr. Christopher Desch , director of the program and one of two team oncologists . &quot; When I say I don ' t know if this guy can get_back and forth to Richmond , they say , ' Well , Uncle Barney can call Fred , and his next-door-neighbor ' s kid will take him. ' &quot; Recognizing that a major obstacle to cancer treatment in rural_areas is lack of access to specialized care , doctors at Massey created the program in 1989 . Oncologists from the center visit the rural hospitals every two weeks to treat patients and train local doctors and nurses to administer chemotherapy . Patients in these areas must travel_to Richmond only for such high-tech procedures as radiation and bone-marrow transplants . The specialists estimate that the program has saved about a_million miles of patient travel . They say it has tapped into a new group of cancer patients who would refuse treatment if it meant driving to a big city . &quot; We ' ve had a lot of people say , ' I ' d rather die than come_to Richmond , ' &quot; said Dr. Thomas Smith , the medical college ' s director of cancer education and the other team oncologist . Virginia ' s cancer-mortality rate is the eighth-highest in the country , attributed in part to high levels of poverty , unemployment , illiteracy and elderly residents . Cancer rates in other rural regions are rising , according to the National Cancer Institute . In his Sept . 22 speech on health-care reform , President Clinton called_for more &quot; strategic alliances between rural hospitals and urban health centers. &quot; One in four Americans lives in the country , often far from hospitals with the latest technology . &quot; They represent a substantial part of the nation , but they ' re a quieter , more stoic portion , &quot; Desch said . The Massey center ' s rural health-care venture began in South Hill , Va. , a tobacco-growing community near the North Carolina border . That program ' s success led doctors to set_up shop in Kilmarnock , a retirement and fishing community on the Chesapeake Bay , and in Farmville , a town in central Virginia . A similar program for nurses only was started recently in Grundy , near the Kentucky border . The program ' s success hasn ' t meant profits either for the Virginia college or for the financially precarious hospitals . Financing comes from an annual $ 250 # 000 state grant and $ 100 # 000 in hospital money and private donations . Most of the patients are_on Medicare or Medicaid or are underinsured . Rappahannock General hopes to open a new building soon for its overcrowded oncology clinic . Much of the $ 700 # 000 needed for the project will have to come from community donations , said hospital administrator Fred Baensch . With an eye toward creating a national model for rural outreach , the college , the country ' s fourth-largest academic medical_center , is evaluating the overall financial impact of its program . &quot; We can show that you can provide superb care at the rural hospitals and the rural hospitals can at least break_even , &quot; Smith said . &quot; What we can ' t show yet is that all rural hospitals can do that. &quot; In fact , some researchers say that one standard program for rural outreach won ' t work because of regional diversity . &quot; The Massey program is only one approach to improving cancer care in rural_areas , &quot; said Dr. Susan G . Nayfield , program director of cancer prevention and control at the National Cancer Institute . &quot; There are other approaches that can be more suitable to the needs of other rural areas. &quot; Researchers at the University of Alabama , for example , are studying attitudes toward cancer in the state ' s rural &quot; Black_Belt , &quot; where beliefs about the disease differ from community to community , Nayfield said . The home-grown nature of the Virginia program accounts_for its comparative success , Smith said . Some hospitals ' idea of cancer outreach , he said , &quot; is to get_in a car with the chemotherapy , drive to a center , give it , bill it , then leave. &quot; At Massey , clinical nurse specialist Cynthia Simonson is reachable 24 hours a day to answer phone_calls from the rural hospital nurses she has helped train in oncology . In turn , the rural nurses handle patient phone_calls that Simonson , Smith and Desch don ' t have time to take . On &quot; clinic day &quot; at Rappahannock General , the one-floor hospital is bustling . Smith and Simonson arrive early for a day of back-to-back appointments with a dozen patients . Connie Deagle is at the hub , arranging for examining rooms and briefing the Massey staff on the patients she has treated in the previous two weeks . Today she must perform one of her saddest duties . Tamara Tuttle , a 62-year-old widow from nearby Irvington , has suffered from breast_cancer for the last year . Only one of her three adult daughters , Susie , who is mentally disabled , lives at_home . Susie is with her mother when Smith informs Tuttle that her breast_cancer has spread so_much that she probably will die within a year . When Deagle enters the room at the end of the physician ' s consultation , Tuttle begins to sob . As Deagle embraces her , she is more_than a nurse . She is a neighbor and a friend .</TEXT>
