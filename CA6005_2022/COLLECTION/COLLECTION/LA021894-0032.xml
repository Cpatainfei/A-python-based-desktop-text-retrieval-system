   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA IS NOT IN GOOD_HEALTH ; BUT DECISION TO SELL U.S.-APPROVED PRESCRIPTION_DRUGS MAY HELP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> New mortality statistics beginning to emerge from Russia offer a startling picture of decline , the result both of what one researcher calls an &quot; unprecedented &quot; rise in the male death rate and a simultaneous sharp increase in infant death rates . The average age for male mortality is now believed to have fallen to 59 , the lowest in Russia in 30 years and well below the average for industrialized countries . Infant_mortality , 17.4 per 1 # 000 in 1990 , jumped to 19.1 last year . Overall , Russia experienced a 20 % rise in its death rate last year , with deaths exceeding births by 800 # 000 . Judith Shapiro , a British academic who has worked with the Russian Finance Ministry , attributes the high death rate for men to two primary causes : an increase in heart_disease and strokes and an increase in violent_deaths . Those causes appear to account_for 75 % of the extra deaths that occurred last year . Shapiro cites what she calls a &quot; psychosocial crisis &quot; as a key contributor to the soaring death rate , meaning the stresses of living in a society increasingly burdened by crime and , for many , growing economic insecurity . Among other things , the quality and availability of health_care in Russia have fallen markedly . Some partial improvement may be in_sight . Russia has now decided to allow virtually all American-made drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be sold in the country , dropping its own testing program . That should soon begin to make available a line of pharmaceuticals that have been either unavailable in Russia or in short supply . Examples of the latter include insulin to treat diabetes and drugs to regulate high_blood_pressure . Both diabetes and hypertension contribute to the heart_disease and strokes among Russian males that appear to have increased so greatly in the last few years . Expanded access to American drugs won ' t end what seems to be a true health crisis in Russia . But at least greater availability should be able to do some good in reducing the sharp and staggering climb in male and infant_mortality that has suddenly occurred .</TEXT>
