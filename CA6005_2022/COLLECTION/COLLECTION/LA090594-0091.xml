   <HEADLINE> IN QUIET KEY WEST THEY SING , YES , WE HAVE NO FLOTILLAS ; TOURISM : ON A HOLIDAY WEEKEND , HOTEL_ROOMS ARE VACANT AND CHARTER BOATS BOB AT THE DOCKS . TRAVELERS APPARENTLY FEAR CUBAN RAFTERS ARE WASHING ASHORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On what is traditionally one of the busiest weekends of the year in the Florida Keys , hotel vacancy signs are lit , some charter boat captains are idling at the dock and luxury cruise_ships are preparing_for the unscheduled stops they may be making at_sea to pick_up non-paying passengers . As the ragtag fleet of rafts continues streaming across the Florida Straits , the Cuban refugee exodus is raising economic havoc with Labor_Day holiday tourism here . &quot; Travel_agents from Minneapolis have called to ask if the streets are safe . Even people in Miami have phoned to ask about health concerns , &quot; said Andy Newman , a spokesman for the Monroe County Tourist Development Council . &quot; We haven ' t seen anything like this since after Hurricane Andrew. &quot; In fact , almost no Cuban refugees have landed in the Keys since Aug . 20 , when the Clinton_Administration ordered the Coast Guard to interdict the rafters at_sea and shuttle them to a detention camp at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . More_than 20 # 000 Cubans are now being held there in a massive tent city . And although the dangerous migration of those fleeing economic hard_times in Cuba continues , the trend is down . By Sunday evening , 1 # 069 Cuban rafters had been picked_up between Cuba and the Keys since midnight Saturday . Last week , rescues were running at an average of 2 # 500 a day . Despite the declining number of rafters , and the talks in New York between U.S. and Cuban officials trying to solve the crisis , the damage to the image of the Florida Keys -- where a third of the 65 # 000 residents make a living from tourism -- has been done . &quot; What are people supposed to think when they see national news reporters on television doing their stand-ups from here , talking_about the flood of refugees ? &quot; Newman asked . A sample of advance bookings for the 8 # 500 hotel_rooms in the Keys showed_business down by 15 % to 35 % of normal , Newman said . &quot; We were seriously hurting , &quot; he said . &quot; . . . Traditionally we sell_out for Labor_Day weekend , the last official summer holiday. &quot; Last weekend , the tourism council spent $ 28 # 000 on advertisements in six Florida newspapers and a computer message to 75 # 000 travel_agents . The newspaper_ad showed the famous picture of President Harry S . Truman holding_up the erroneous headline &quot; Dewey Defeats Truman &quot; and went_on to point_out that reports of the Keys being awash with refugees were equally incorrect . But although the advertising_campaign may help boost the fall tourist season , only a_few thousand walk-ins will save this three-day weekend . In Key West , the Marriott Casa Marina , with more_than 300 rooms , was only 87 % booked by late Saturday . In Islamorada , Days Inn front desk_clerk Pat Hajzer said 30 % of the rooms were vacant at noon Sunday . &quot; People call and ask , ' What ' s happening down there ? ' &quot; said Faye M . Bailey , assistant general_manager of Marina del Mar resort in Key Largo . &quot; The general perception is that we have rafts floating up_on beaches and immigrants running_through our streets . The misperceptions are incredible. &quot; Compounding the image problem , Bailey added , reports last week about a tropical wave of low_pressure moving through the Florida Straits were misinterpreted by many potential visitors to mean hurricane . &quot; We had a_few thunderstorms , &quot; Bailey said . &quot; that ' s normal. &quot; During the first few weeks of August , before the beefed-up armada of U.S. military ships began to intercept most Florida-bound rafters , some Cubans refugees did make_it to shore . And those who only came_close were often met by U.S. fishing_boats . Hank Powell , captain of the Chief , said he recently rescued five raft-loads of Cubans in one day . &quot; The Coast Guard planes would circle us three times , and we ' d have to follow them to a raft , &quot; he said . Powell said he would secure the raft alongside the Chief , offer the Cubans water and food and then stand_by for two hours or more until a Coast Guard vessel arrived . He said his clients , paying_up to $ 600 for a full day ' s charter , were usually understanding . But the interruptions were not good for business . &quot; I ' ve had two cancellations this week , &quot; he said . Because of the increased Coast Guard presence , Powell said he is more likely to encounter empty rafts from which the refugees have already been rescued . And ironically , he said , those empty rafts improve fishing . &quot; The dolphin and wahoo stay under them in the shade , &quot; he said . &quot; So we go right for them. &quot; Although the Coast Guard attempts to burn or sink rafts after saving their occupants , so many makeshift vessels survive as flotsam in the Florida Straits and the Gulf_Stream that they have become a hazard to navigation . A national boat owners association , BOAT / US , last week issued a warning to members to watch_out for the rafts , some of which are made of 55-gallon steel_drums . In Dade County , a debris removal_firm has been hired to salvage the rafts , which are washing_up along southern Florida beaches and various uninhabited islands . The captains of cruise_ships , especially those that ply the Miami-Key West-Cozumel , Mexico , route , have also been alerted to rafts , both occupied and abandoned . By law , any U.S. boater must render assistance to people in distress at_sea . That means that some Cuban rafters take a cruise to Mexico before being handed_over to the Coast Guard .</TEXT>
