   <HEADLINE> JUDGE SETS STAGE FOR BATTLE OVER SOKA CAMPUS SITE ; COURT : SCHOOL ' S LAST CONDEMNATION CHALLENGES ARE THROWN OUT . STATE , UNIVERSITY PRESENT CASES NEXT MONTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After nearly two years of preliminary skirmishes , a judge this week cleared the way for Soka University and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to face_off in a key fight over the school ' s scenic Calabasas campus . The two sides meet Nov . 23 in Los Angeles Superior_Court to argue whether the conservancy has the right to condemn a part of Soka ' s campus at Mulholland Highway and Las Virgenes Road . &quot; The hearing in November is the prize fight , &quot; Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said Friday . Conservancy staff counsel Liz Cheadle agreed , saying , &quot; This is big , big. &quot; If a judge determines that the conservancy -- a state agency that acquires parkland -- has the right to take 245 acres of Soka ' s property , the case will then go_to a jury to decide how much the school should be paid_for the land . November ' s hearing is a critical_point in the eminent_domain case , coming two years after the conservancy initially began condemnation proceedings in late 1992 . The delay resulted from a series of legal challenges that have cost both sides hundreds of thousands of dollars . In a ruling released Friday , Judge Robert H . O ' Brien threw_out the last of several challenges filed by Soka in its effort to fight the conservancy ' s condemnation . In its latest challenge , the school argued that the conservancy should have conducted an environmental analysis of the condemnation . The school argued such a review was necessary because , it claimed , the conservancy intends to sell the property to the National_Park_Service to use as a visitors ' center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area . But O ' Brien said no review was required because the conservancy intends to essentially preserve the site , which includes the historic estate built by shaving razor magnate King Gillette . Soka ' s Ourvan said the school will appeal O ' Brien ' s ruling . When Soka and conservancy lawyers finally do present their cases before Judge Barnet Cooperman , their arguments will sound familiar . Soka lawyers will argue , as they did_in 1992 before a different judge , that the conservancy violated state law when it began condemnation proceedings . The condemnation is being pursued by an arm of the conservancy called the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority . Because the authority has a joint powers agreement with two Ventura County parks agencies , it received permission from that county ' s Board of Supervisors to begin the condemnation -- even though Soka is entirely within Los Angeles County . Soka lawyers argue that the approval is invalid , and that permission should have come from the state Board of Public Works , which signs_off on condemnation attempts by state agencies such_as the conservancy . A Ventura County judge agreed with Soka in 1992 , but she was overturned by the state Court of Appeal , which ruled that the school should raise its objections during the hearing scheduled for Nov . 23 .</TEXT>
