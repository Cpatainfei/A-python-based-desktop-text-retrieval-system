   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK ; FALLEN FAME ; LANDMARKS SUFFER DAMAGE , INCLUDING FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE . EGYPTIAN THEATER , CHURCHES AMONG THOSE HIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At his masterpiece Hollyhock House on a hillside above east Hollywood , architect Frank Lloyd Wright placed 14 rooftop spires , each four feet high and molded in concrete to resemble the many-petaled hollyhock flower that inspired his 1919 design . On Wednesday , five of those spires had been toppled -- two shattered beyond repair -- by this week ' s earthquake and aftershocks . The massive Mayan-style fireplace in the city-owned house showed hairline cracks , its library room foundation had slipped , and concrete garden walls had tumbled down the westerly cliff of the Barnsdall Park cultural complex . &quot; It ' s going_to be a very expensive proposition , but structurally the building is not in bad shape , &quot; Hollyhock ' s curator Virginia Kazor said of possible repairs , as she led an entourage of architectural preservationists , city cultural officials and state and local politicians through the house Wednesday . The tour was part of a still-emerging effort to determine earthquake damage at Los Angeles-area architectural , historical and cultural landmarks . Building by building , street by street , volunteers and government employees are inspecting those treasures of the Southland and urging owners of damaged landmarks not to move too hastily toward demolition . &quot; It ' s important to us to stay ahead of the curve before people get firmed_up that the buildings can ' t possibly be saved . Maybe they can ' t , &quot; said William F . Delvac , an architectural preservationist who works_at a Hollywood-based firm called Historic Resources Group . For him and others involved in the ongoing surveys , this week brought_back bad memories of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles . According to a report by the state Office of Historic Preservation , more_than 100 buildings damaged or destroyed in that civil unrest were historically , architecturally or culturally significant . Some are still awaiting repair . It may take weeks to come_up with such a count for the earthquake . The temblor ' s effect on landmarks varied widely , depending_on geology , construction methods and sheer luck . The Downtown Los Angeles Central Library , which burned in 1986 and reopened last fall after $ 214 million in renovation , came_through Monday ' s temblor with little damage . The two-century-old San Gabriel Mission church , which reopened in September after a $ 1.2-million project to repair damage caused by the 1987 Whittier quake , suffered only plaster cracks this time . The Hollywood sign and most historic structures Downtown emerged in good_shape . The stone mansion McGroarty house , at the McGroarty Cultural Center Park in Tujunga , was nearly unscathed , officials reported . The exterior of the Art Deco Bullocks Wilshire building in Mid-Wilshire had no visible cracks . The Watts Towers showed more_than a dozen cracks , but Rodney Punt , assistant general_manager of the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department , said those appear to be minor problems . The Egyptian Theater on Hollywood Boulevard now has huge holes in its rear tile walls that were thought to be repairable , as were the exterior cracks behind the massive screen in the nearby Chinese Theater . A recently restored 1920 Art Deco building at 5620 Hollywood Blvd. , designed by John Parkinson , one of the architects of Los Angeles City_Hall , had its pyramid-shaped crown knocked loose from a tower that looms 95 feet over the two-story structure . The pyramid was dangling precariously Wednesday , but the former bank_building will be fixed , declared its owners , the Johns &amp; Gorman Films television commercial production company . The structure is eligible for the national and local landmark status , experts say . More threatened are a host of beloved churches and apartment_buildings in Santa Monica . St . Monica ' s Roman_Catholic_Church , a 1925 Romanesque structure , showed fractures on its tower top to bottom . The Spanish-style Charmont apartments on California Avenue and the El Cortez apartments on 4th Street were both in bad shape . So was the Henry Weaver House , a distinguished 1910 example of the Craftsman style which , like the Egyptian and Chinese theaters and Hollyhock House , is_on the National Register of Historic Places . The owners of the building , Lauren Greene and television director David B . Greene , spent more_than $ 400 # 000 restoring the two-story Santa Monica house since 1985 , and now are not certain if they can afford massive repairs , Lauren Greene said . In the earthquake , bricks flew off the foundation , sinking vertical timber beams that are supposed to support the massive porch roof ; the roof is collapsing in several spots , she explained . Owners of some_other historic or architectural landmarks may use earthquake damage as a pretext to tear_down structures that could be otherwise saved , said Linda Dishman , executive_director of the Los Angeles Conservancy , the preservationist group conducting the surveys . One such looming battle is said to involve the former Brown Derby , which housed the fabled restaurant on Vine Street in Hollywood . The 65-year-old Spanish-style building was damaged in two arson fires since its 1985 closing and had some of its brick walls cracked this week . The owners reportedly want to tear it down for a parking_lot . On Wednesday , the building was cordoned off and had the ominous red danger tag from city inspectors on its front_door . Barry A . Milofsky , an architect who volunteered Wednesday to help with the conservancy ' s survey of Hollywood buildings , said he thought the two-story Brown Derby could be restored even now . The owners could not be reached for comment . The Brown Derby is part of a large district on and near Hollywood Boulevard that is listed on the National Register . Such designation does not grant permanent protection from demolition , but does allow at least delays on tear-downs through state rules , officials said . State Sen . Milton Marks , the San Francisco area Democrat , toured the Hollyhock House and other Hollywood area sites Wednesday . In the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake , Marks authored a law that forbids demolition of a national , state or locally designated landmark damaged in a natural disaster &quot; unless the structure presents an imminent threat &quot; of bodily harm to the public or damage to adjacent property . The law calls_for inspections of such damaged buildings by experts selected by the state Office of Historic Preservation . Also on the tour was Douglas P . Wheeler , state Secretary for Resources , who oversees historic preservation . State rules promulgated in 1991 further put brakes on proposed demolition of any damaged building on or eligible for the National Register , Wheeler noted . &quot; Procedurally , we want demolition only in the last_resort , &quot; Wheeler said . At the Hollyhock House , those officials -- along with Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg -- were saddened to see the cracks and tumbled spires . But they were relieved to see how a leaded glass ceiling fixture had fallen_down to a carpet and had only two tiny panels cracked . They were also happy to see that the Wright-designed furniture survived , and were pleased to learn that the broken spires can be replicated . &quot; The damage is significant , but I was impressed it was not more , &quot; Wheeler said . &quot; I had feared the worst. &quot; Still , the repairs might cost $ 750 # 000 , estimated Punt , of the city cultural affairs department . Meanwhile , he said , tours might resume soon if rooms on the south_side are cordoned off .</TEXT>
