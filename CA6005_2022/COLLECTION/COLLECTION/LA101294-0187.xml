   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : GLENDALE ; ANTI-PROP . 187 FORUM HOSTED BY STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Latino students at Glendale Community_College waged war Tuesday on the so-called &quot; Save Our State &quot; initiative , calling it a calculated , cynical plan concocted by Gov . Pete Wilson and other Republicans to win the &quot; anti-immigrant vote. &quot; The college ' s ethnic studies department and the Assn . of Latin_American Students held a four-hour forum on Proposition 187 , with panelists discussing the impact on California ' s education , health_care , welfare and other programs if the initiative -- which would deny most public benefits to illegal immigrants -- passes . &quot; This will not solve the immigration problem . There ' s no money for building big walls or increasing the Border_Patrol , &quot; said Jimmy Franco , of the League of United Latin_American Citizens . He accused conservative backers of the initiative of using illegal immigrants as a &quot; scapegoat &quot; to avoid addressing the causes of California ' s recession -- unemployment , homelessness and other problems . Other panelists said the initiative would force about 150 # 000 students in the greater Los Angeles area out of public_schools , create a &quot; public health crisis &quot; as illegal immigrants are refused health_care except in emergencies , and foster a &quot; climate of suspicion &quot; in which teachers , social_workers and others would be required to report possible illegal immigrants . &quot; I don ' t want to be a surrogate INS agent , &quot; said Judy London , an attorney with a social_service agency for Central_American refugees . &quot; Nobody should be an agent of the INS unless they are employed by the INS. &quot; The group also noted a report by the nonpartisan state Legislative Analyst ' s Office indicating that California could lose about $ 15 billion a year in income_taxes , school funding and other revenues if the initiative passes . The college_students hoped to present a united front to counteract the strong showing the proposition has made in recent opinion polls among likely voters . But some in the audience said the presentation was too one-sided . Tich Tran , 19 , an Asian American student , said illegal immigrants should not be entitled to the same benefits as U . S . citizens . &quot; We ' re not supposed to present only one side of the story . We need to present both sides so the students can make_up their own minds , &quot; said Jiwon Moore , a sociology instructor at the college . &quot; Instead of debating the issue , this will only cause more anger for the students that are thinking_of voting yes on 187. &quot; Opponents conceded that it may pass Nov . 8 , but if so , they predicted that it will be challenged in court and ultimately overturned as unconstitutional by the U . S . Supreme Court . And if it does pass , they said they will refuse to abide_by it . &quot; As professors we will be required to ask our students for the documentation before we begin our lectures , &quot; said Carlos Ugalde , an instructor of ethnic studies . &quot; I personally will not ask my students for their documents , &quot; he said . &quot; And I don ' t think there ' s going_to be enough jails ( to accommodate ) all_the people who are going_to be refusing. &quot; STEVE RYFLE</TEXT>
