   <HEADLINE> SHOP_TALK : FIRMS CAN BAN HOLIDAY WORK , REQUIRE MAKEUP TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Question : My husband works for a large company that makes its employees make_up the time they take_off for national_holidays . Workers don ' t get the choice of working the holiday either . How cheap can a company get ? Have you heard this before ? -- R.L. , Los Alamitos Answer : Companies are allowed to prohibit work_on a national_holiday , to pay compensation for the holiday and to require employees to make_up the time later . They are restricted , however , as_to how the work is to be made_up . The employer cannot require a non-exempt employee to work more_than eight hours in any day or more_than 40 hours in any week , along with other requirements , without paying appropriate overtime compensation . Exempt employees have flexibility in work schedules to meet productivity requirements of the employer . But there is a risk that the exempt status may be destroyed if an employer requires an exempt employee to make_up a day ' s missed time on another day or to give credit on one day for excess time worked_on another . If that happens , the employer might have to comply with all_of the rules for non-exempt status , including premium payment for overtime . If an employee is not_able to make_up the time on a Saturday or a Sunday because of religious_beliefs or family care commitments , the employer must reasonably accommodate such concerns to avoid legal liability . -- Don D . Sessions Employee rights attorney Mission Viejo * Question : I voluntarily quit a job under much duress . It ' s been about two years . Is there a time_limit on trying to do something legally about the situation ? -- L.S. , Cypress Answer : The time_limit for filing a lawsuit for employment discrimination is one year , so you are too late to file such a claim . You may still be able to file a lawsuit for &quot; constructive termination &quot; in breach_of_contract , but you face a number of significant hurdles . First , you will have to show that you and your former employer had a contract under which you could not be terminated except for cause . This would not have to be an explicit , written contract , but you would have to be able to prove that your former employer had a policy or practice of not terminating people without a good reason . Second , you would have to show more_than that your job was stressful . You would have to show that your former employer ' s treatment of you was so egregious that a reasonable person in a similar position would have had no choice but to resign . Third , if the duress to which you refer was your boss ' s criticism of your work , you would have to show more_than just that you do not believe the criticism was warranted . You would have to show that your former employer deliberately made_up false reasons to criticize you in an attempt to make you quit . Finally , you may have a time problem as well . The time_limit for lawsuits based on oral_contracts is two years and though the limit for a lawsuit based on a written contract is four years , in_order to qualify for the longer limit you would have to rely substantially on any written policies of your former employer to make your case . -- James J . McDonald Jr . Attorney , Fisher &amp; Phillips labor law instructor , UC Irvine * Question : When you leave a company before completing a full year , are you paid prorated vacation time ? I ' ll be leaving one month short of my sixth year and should be entitled to two weeks ' vacation time . -- S.B. , Rossmoor Answer : There is no employer obligation to provide vacation benefits for their employees . It is , however , among the most common of benefits provided . Any legal_rights to such benefits would depend_on whether vacation benefits are included as a provision in an employment_contract , a collective_bargaining agreement or stated as a written employer policy . Vacation policies vary , but typically employers establish vacation benefits that are earned or accrued over the course of a year of employment ( e.g. two weeks -- 10 days -- of vacation for each year of service ) . If your employer has established such a policy , you need to determine the amount of vacation time provided_for each year of service . You also need to determine how much vacation time you have already taken . I ' m assuming that you have exhausted allowable vacation for the first five years of service but have not taken any vacation time for the sixth year . If so , you would be entitled to receive a prorated portion of vacation for the sixth year ( 11 / 12 of the sixth year ' s vacation earned ) . Review your company ' s policy and practice on vacation benefits . If after careful review you determine you are eligible for partial vacation pay , discuss the issue with your employer and request payment . -- Elizabeth Winfree-Lydon Senior staff consultant The Employers Group * Question : For nine months , I have been allowed to work 10 hours a day , four days a week . No one else in my department does , although the option is there . I was recently told that I had to go_back to a five-day-a-week schedule because it was illegal for me to be the only one in the department to work the four-day schedule . Is there such a law ? Answer : Yes , in a way . The California Industrial Welfare Commission Orders , which apply to virtually all employees in California , require employers to pay to non-exempt employees a premium pay of 1 1 / 2 times the regular rate for all hours over eight daily . The orders contain an exception for employers who want to have a recognized work_unit on a schedule of 10 hours a day for four days a week . But an employer is entitled to that exemption only if it conducts a vote among the employees affected . A two-thirds majority of them must then support that schedule . Assuming that your employer never held such a vote and that it has not been paying you premium pay_for hours worked in excess of eight hours daily , your employer is probably correct in what it has told you . You may have a claim against your employer for overtime pay worked in the past under that schedule . -- Michael A . Hood Employment law attorney Paul , Hastings , Janofsky &amp; Walker * Question : What exactly constitutes age discrimination and how do you prove it ? I am a_few months past 60 and have worked in a sales territory in Southern California for 33 years . My present manager told others that I was too old to be fired . This statement was made less than three months after we met . It was followed by statements to me such_as , &quot; If you can ' t change , quit. &quot; She admitted making the statement about my age , but apologized -- not so_much for saying it but because I found_out she said it . I have seen a doctor twice because of the stress she has caused me this past year . She does not like to talk to me directly but uses voice mail or a district_manager to pass_on messages . What recourse might I have ? -- E.S. , Orange Answer : Workplace discrimination on the basis of_age against those at least 40 years old is prohibited . However , to sue for age discrimination you must show that you were let_go , demoted or were the object of some_other adverse job decision . You have not indicated whether any adverse change in your job has been made by your employer . If such a change has occurred , you may have grounds for age discrimination . As an alternative , you may be able to argue that your manager is acting in an extreme and outrageous manner so as_to cause you severe emotional distress . -- Thomas M . Apke , attorney Professor of business law Cal State Fullerton * Question : To what degree is a major employer obligated to adjust work schedules to help a worker participate in a van pool ? I ' m usually scheduled to work from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. , and every third month my shift begins and ends 30 minutes later . The van pool at my company arrives_at the office at 7:30 a.m. and departs at 4 p.m. I would need my supervisor to shift my permanent schedule in_order to take_advantage of the van pool . Only one other person in my department works an earlier shift , but that person would not trade with me . My boss says he can ' t afford to adjust the schedule . Is there anything I can do ? -- G.M. , Mission Viejo Answer : The South Coast Air Quality Management District requires companies with more_than 100 employees to adopt a ride-sharing program . However , it is up_to each employer to devise and implement its own program . There are no particular requirements with_respect_to how such a program is implemented . Therefore , this problem is one that you will just have to work_out with your supervisor . Perhaps you could find someone else in your neighborhood who has a schedule similar to yours , and establish your own ride-sharing arrangement . -- Calvin House , attorney Fulbright &amp; Jaworski L.L.P.
