   <TEXT> Smokers are out and animals are in as Los Angeles County enters a new year . Anti-smoking measures wafted across the county landscape this year , while creatures from potbellied pigs to whales found the favor of lawmakers . Here is a sampling of laws enacted in 1994 . Los Angeles Artwork -- Officials imposed a moratorium on placement of artwork in MacArthur Park , saying it is cluttered with more_than 25 statues , plaques , murals and fountains in dire need of repair . The ban will last until the park ' s existing art work is restored . Chimneys -- After thousands of Angelenos lost brick chimneys in the Jan . 17 earthquake , officials began requiring homeowners to hire an engineer to design a method of anchoring the chimney to the house ' s frame and use steel reinforcement . Stricter construction reviews for outdoor brick walls also were imposed . Conservation -- Residents can now use recycled water from bathtubs , sinks and washing_machines for landscaping irrigation if they install a filtration system . Such systems can cost from several hundred dollars to $ 5 # 000 .

Emergency lighting -- Spurred by power outages after the Northridge quake , the city required owners of residential buildings with more_than five units to install battery-powered emergency lights to help tenants get_out during emergencies . Owners of existing buildings have up_to five years to comply . Golf -- The city increased its golf fees from $ 15 to $ 16 a round during the week and $ 19.50 to $ 20.50 on weekends . Shut-off valves -- As a result of the nearly 17 # 000 gas leaks that were caused by the earthquake , all new residential , commercial , industrial and government buildings must have valves that automatically shut_off main gas_lines during a temblor . Smoking -- Smoking was prohibited in all city-owned buildings . Other facilities owned and leased by the city previously were covered under an ordinance that restricted but did not bar smoking in public and private workplaces . The new law imposes a total ban in those facilities . Tenants -- Under an ordinance designed to prevent landlords from using quake damage to force_out tenants in favor of new ones paying higher rent , the original tenants must receive first priority to reoccupy buildings damaged in quakes after repairs are made .

But red_tape and infighting between the vendors have caused months of delay , and no legal districts have yet been set_up . L.A. County Day_laborers -- The county made curbside job-seeking in unincorporated areas a misdemeanor punishable by up_to six months in jail or a $ 1 # 000 fine or both .
