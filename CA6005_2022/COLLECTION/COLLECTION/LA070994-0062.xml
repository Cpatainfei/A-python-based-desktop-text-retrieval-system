   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP SHOULDN ' T BE CONSIDERED SPOILED BY MURDER OF ESCOBAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I read with bittersweet amusement the headline on Jim Murray ' s column in today ' s paper , &quot; Death Will Be the Lasting Memory. &quot; The death of Andres Escobar will probably become the lasting memory of the ' 94 Cup , not because it is representative of anything but the sad state of affairs in Colombia , but because it is such an easy story to cover . Guns , drugs and murder make wonderful copy -- no , they make sensational copy . And to lump these sensational elements with a sport little understood and generally written_about as un-American , so brilliantly panders to the public palate ( whose appetite is daily whetted with the blood-sport of Menendezes , Buttafuocos and Bobbitts ) as_to put the late W.R. Hearst to shame . Not only can Americans feel good about despising this barbaric sport , but they can revel in all its tawdry , gory details over a cup of coffee in the morning before tuning_in to the O.J. Simpson hearings . MARK BALDWIN Los Angeles * Jim Murray says the 1994 World Cup &quot; will be remembered for a murder . . . Cause of death : World Cup soccer . Murder One. &quot; It ' s amazing that a so-called professional journalist can ' t figure_out that it was a gang of drug-dealing , gambling hooligans who shot Escobar . Soccer fans didn ' t do_it . Bora Milutinovic didn ' t do_it , and neither did Tony Meola , Alexi Lalas , Romario , Bebeto or Pele . World Cup ' 94 &quot; will be known for the Murder in Medellin &quot; only for those like Mr. Murray , who are oblivious to what goes_on in the world . RICH WINOGRAD Thousand Oaks * The murder of Andres Escobar is not so_much an aberration of the degree of violence associated with sports in the 20th Century , but a punctuation_mark . The obsession with winning and the unbalanced view of what sports competition is really all about manifests itself every day . As a soccer referee , I have witnessed verbal and physical assault at all levels of play . Not only is abuse of athletes and spectators rampant , but the abuse heaped on officials is so common that it is considered by some to be part and parcel of sports competition . Respect , decency and fair play are in short supply on America ' s soccer fields , baseball_diamonds and basketball_courts . Escobar ' s murder may be a glimpse into the future of the American sports scene if we do not , as a nation , realign our priorities . DUSTIN FUNDERBURK Costa Mesa * I was incensed on June 4 , when my wife and I went_to the Rose Bowl to see the U.S. national team play Mexico , when we walked up_to our seats and had to endure jeering , thrown objects and obscenities because we were wearing the red , white and blue . I was furious when she was hit in the head , twice , with ice as we cheered the &quot; home &quot; team to victory . Now I hear about Mexican fans trashing the streets of L.A. while celebrating their World Cup victory on the other side of the continent . The World Cup didn ' t bring hooligans to America -- they ' ve been here all_the time . M . WEIS Irvine * Let ' s not be getting too upset or surprised that Diego Maradona has been caught cheating again . His career has been an endless string of dives and play-acting . How about some belated sympathy for the 1986 England team when he punched the ball into the goal . Don ' t panic about the World Cup . Somebody else will rise to the top . PAUL ZURBRUGG Van Nuys * Congratulations to Chris Dufresne for recognizing that the Germany-Belgium game turned_on a horrendous non-call . The Germans would never have won a man down , in regulation or overtime . And Germany ' s Rudi Voeller fouled a Belgian defender on his second goal , a header , with a well-placed forearm . We ' ve seen this type of officiating that benefits Germany and other World Cup powers before . Until this shameful bias stops , the event might best be called the &quot; Selected Parts of Certain Hemispheres Cup. &quot; D.A. COCHRANE Los Angeles * When is this soccer stuff going_to be over with so our sports pages will again look_like they used to ? A.E. SAARI Fullerton</TEXT>
