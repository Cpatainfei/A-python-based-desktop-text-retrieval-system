EDGAR HOOVER AND LAPD CHIEF WILLIAM PARKER SPARKED A DECADES-LONG FEUD . BUT NOW THE AGENCIES ARE TRYING TO REPAIR THEIR RELATIONSHIP , ARRESTING FUGITIVES WITH ASTONISHING SUCCESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When it comes_to corralling criminals in the city of Los Angeles , no one stands taller than the LAPD and the FBI , two of the nation ' s biggest and proudest law_enforcement agencies . Yet for decades the organizations often have eyed one another with suspicion , feuding quietly at some times , noisily at others . Their differences -- exacerbated most recently by the resentment many LAPD officers harbor for FBI_agents who investigated the beating of Rodney G . King -- have been known to hamper the efforts of both agencies . Even today , some FBI_agents stereotype LAPD officers as thick-skulled cowboys , ill-equipped for sophisticated investigations . Many police_officers , in turn , deride FBI_agents as little more_than tight-lipped bureaucrats -- &quot; accountants with guns &quot; is a favorite put-down . In recent months , however , the twin towers of Los Angeles law_enforcement have begun reconstructing their relationship , producing a wealth of successful cases , particularly in apprehending fugitives . It may be too soon to declare the feud over , law_enforcement sources say -- just last month , the FBI opened a civil_rights investigation into an LAPD shooting , a move sure to anger some police_officers . But for the first time in years , there are glimmers of a truce . &quot; It hasn ' t really been a happy world between the FBI and the LAPD , &quot; said Special_Agent Geoff Bickers , who started_up the Los Angeles office ' s Gangster Apprehension Team , one of two fugitive units that combines FBI_agents and representatives of local law_enforcement agencies . &quot; But this has been seen as a kind of a bridge . . . . Things seem to be_on the mend. &quot; And partly as a result , certain kinds of arrests are sharply on the rise . In the early 1990s , the FBI was catching 50 or 60 felony fugitives a year . Last year , two special units -- one made_up of the FBI , the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department and the state_Department of Justice , the other combining the FBI and the LAPD -- reeled in 230 . As the collaboration progressed , the local law_enforcement agencies solved some old and difficult cases : Last November , Robert Lee Perkins was arrested in Montgomery , Ala. , and returned to Los Angeles to face charges that he murdered his girlfriend in 1973 . That arrest cleared a case that was buried deep in the LAPD ' s unsolved homicide files , and members of the fugitive units say it helped cement the working relationship between the police_officers and FBI_agents . &quot; They handed us this case and said : You want a challenge , try this one , &quot; said FBI Special_Agent Mark Llewellyn , who supervises the Fugitive Task_Force . &quot; We kind of proved ourselves right off the bat. &quot; LAPD Lt . Sergio Robleto , the commanding_officer of South Bureau Homicide , was among those most impressed by the quick work in that and other cases : &quot; We ' re working better together than we used to . . . . It ' s been very effective. &quot; Such talk is quite a departure from the legendary confrontations of yore . Former Los Angeles Police_Chief Daryl F . Gates said the hostilities date_back to 1950 -- when William H . Parker took_over the LAPD and J . Edgar Hoover was in_charge of the FBI . &quot; The bad_blood between the LAPD and the FBI began when Parker , as the new chief , demonstrated that he was his own man and that he would not be beholden to J . Edgar , &quot; Gates wrote in his autobiography , &quot; Chief : My Life in the LAPD. &quot; &quot; I ' m not aware of a particular incident ; in fact , I don ' t believe the two men ever met . But Parker made his thoughts on law_enforcement clear through his speeches , articles , and the direction in which he was taking the department . All of this was duly reported back to Hoover through the local head of the FBI , whom Parker tended to ignore . In the ' 40s , I am told , Hoover enjoyed visiting L.A. , hanging_out with movie_stars and studio chiefs . His visits abruptly ceased after Parker became chief . &quot; In time our officers were excluded from the three-month training academy run_by the FBI. &quot; That may have been the beginning . But it was far from the end . * Take the 1981 hijacking of a Continental Airlines jet at Los Angeles International Airport . Police and FBI_agents rolled to the scene . Once there , each insisted that the other agency back_off . The LAPD officers , led by Gates , declared that they would handle the crisis because it was their city ; the FBI_agents asserted federal jurisdiction because it was an airline hijacking . After a tense standoff on the airport Tarmac , the FBI prevailed . The next year , when Armenian terrorists murdered the Turkish consul general in Los Angeles , the LAPD and the FBI again butted heads : The FBI claimed jurisdiction because the crime involved terrorists and a diplomat , while the LAPD asserted itself because murder is a state offense . In that case , each agency came_away with a piece of the action . The federal_government investigated and prosecuted a related firebombing . The LAPD and state authorities handled the murder . The agencies ' cooperativeness was tested yet again when the Olympics came_to Los Angeles in 1984 . The FBI touted its expertise in combatting terrorism ; the LAPD trotted_out its highly acclaimed special weapons and tactics forces and other specialized units and said it was prepared to play the lead role . Gates visited Asia , Europe and the Middle_East to learn more about the business of terrorists , and he steadfastly refused to pledge that he would defer to the FBI in the event of a terrorist attack . Frustrated , FBI Director William H . Webster pulled Gates aside at a meeting in Washington and urged him to reconsider . Gates stood_firm . &quot; You guys will screw the thing up and go_back to Washington and you ' ll leave me to deal with this , &quot; Gates remembers telling federal_officials . &quot; No way. &quot; Instead , Gates agreed that if there was an attack and national security was threatened , he would consider turning_over jurisdiction at that point . There was no attack , so the agreement was never tested . &quot; There ' s always a little bit of tension between local authorities and federal authorities , &quot; said Stephen S . Trott , a federal appeals judge who was the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles during the early 1980s . &quot; that ' s been especially true in Los Angeles because the LAPD is a very proud agency and feels it can handle any situation. &quot; That is as true today as it was then , but longtime observers of the Los Angeles law_enforcement scene say the FBI and LAPD began warming_to one another about two years ago . A key breakthrough , officials say , occurred in the wake of the 1992 riots . With public attention riveted on the brutal beating of trucker Reginald O . Denny and other motorists during the opening hours of the riots , it was an FBI informant who first identified Damian Monroe Williams as one of the attackers . The FBI passed that tip on to the LAPD , whose detectives joined with FBI_agents to investigate the crimes that occurred at Florence and Normandie avenues . &quot; that ' s how all this started , &quot; said FBI Special_Agent Joe Waggoner , who supervises the Gangster Apprehension Team . Just as important as that tip and its repercussions have been the changing faces at the top of the two agencies . Special Agent-in-Charge Charlie J . Parsons was named as the FBI ' s Los Angeles field division chief in July , 1991 , and he quickly set_out to court the LAPD . He appeared in public on several occasions with Gates , most visibly in the wake of the riots when the two men announced the arrest of Williams and others involved in the Florence and Normandie attacks . * Parsons ' overtures helped initiate a thaw between the agencies . But the most important personnel change for sealing the new cooperation , according to longtime law_enforcement sources , was Gates ' 1992 departure from the Police_Department , now headed by Willie L . Williams . As was evident in the jostling over the 1984 Olympics , Gates was fiercely committed to the notion that the LAPD could take_charge of any situation . &quot; Daryl would arrive_at a scene and plant the flag , &quot; one law_enforcement source said . &quot; He would announce : ' We can handle this. &quot; ' Gates agrees . &quot; It ' s always been an uneasy situation with the FBI , &quot; he said . &quot; They don ' t have expertise in a lot of areas that they get_into . . . . I wasn ' t afraid to say that. &quot; However , if Gates ' departure expedited a detente , the Rodney G . King case certainly set it back . In that case , FBI_agents were assigned to investigate LAPD officers , and they pursued their quarry with a vengeance that angered many police_officers . Some officers thought the investigation and prosecution were politically motivated ; others accused the federal_government of violating the accused officers ' right not to be subjected_to double_jeopardy -- a claim with little legal merit but great emotional significance . At the end of that case , two LAPD officers went_to federal prison . Many of their colleagues blamed the FBI and the Justice_Department . &quot; I felt they prostituted themselves to the politicians , &quot; said LAPD Detective Bill Arnado , a 28-year veteran who stressed in an interview that he was speaking only for himself , not the department . &quot; I know a lot of fine street agents , but the FBI , as an agency , was overzealous and was right on the verge of violating police_officers ' rights. &quot; Some officers throughout the city still bristle_at the mere mention of the FBI , and the agents and officers who work with the fugitive unit say they have felt that tension on occasion . &quot; At times , I ' ve met a little resistance , &quot; said Detective Robert Vanina , an LAPD officer who works with the Fugitive Task_Force . &quot; There are people in the department who are of the opinion that because of Rodney King , we shouldn ' t have anything to do with the FBI . It may be too_much to say that they think the FBI ' s the enemy , but they sure don ' t think they ' re friends. &quot; Nevertheless , Vanina said , many police_officers are gradually coming_around , persuaded by the success the task_force has enjoyed . Vanina heads the LAPD ' s half of the Fugitive Task_Force , one of two units combining federal_agents and local authorities to round_up fugitives . The other , the Gangster Apprehension Team , was the first to get under way . Although it too originally included LAPD officers , today it combines the FBI , the Sheriff ' s Department and the state_Department of Justice . * Both groups hunt for fugitives , and both have racked_up impressive numbers of arrests . Moreover , the cases they produce are a prosecutor ' s dream because most of the suspects have been convicted of crimes and often are sent straight to jail once they are caught . Those arrests have ranged from the mundane to the spectacular -- from run-of-the-mill attackers to a more exotic stripe of criminal . There was the art thief who would call prosecutors every year and boast that he would never be found ; he committed suicide when the task_force showed_up at his door . Then there was the Gypsy accused of robbing elderly people who turned himself in after the Arizona king of the Gypsies intervened on his behalf . &quot; I got a call from his lawyer who said : ' Do you want to talk to the king of the Gypsies ? ' &quot; recalled FBI Special_Agent Scott Hanley , a member of the Fugitive Task_Force . &quot; I said : ' Sure , put him on , I ' ve never spoken_to a king before. &quot; ' * Hanley told the Gypsy king that if the suspect turned himself in , he could save himself the punishment for fleeing a federal warrant . Two weeks later , the suspect returned from Arizona and surrendered to the LAPD . As the fugitive and gang units embark_on their second year , law_enforcement officials warn that they alone will never entirely end the wariness between federal and local law_enforcement . But success has a way of smoothing over differences , and police_officers and federal_agents say the fugitive units have dramatically served the interests of both agencies . That may be the strongest foundation for a new law_enforcement alliance , they say . With Cooperation , Arrests Soar The FBI and local law_enforcement agencies -- including the LAPD , the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department and the California Department_of_Justice -- joined forces in late 1992 to seek_out and arrest fugitives . Since then , arrests have skyrocketed . 02 # 06 , 09 Year Arrests 1990 63 1991 53 1992 129 1993 230 Note : The Gangster Apprehension Team was formed in October , 1992 ; the Fugitive Task_Force was formed in March , 1993 . Fugitive Profiles There are thousands of felony fugitives at_large in Los Angeles County . Members of the federal-local law_enforcement teams say there are a_few they are especially eager to find . Among them : * Sarkis Vartan Peltakian * Age : 32 * Description : White male , 5 ' 8 &quot; tall , 200 lbs. , black hair , brown eyes . A native of Lebanon , Peltakian legally immigrated to the United States in 1976 . * Why he is wanted : On July 2 , 1993 , Peltakian allegedly lost_control of his vehicle on a freeway and hit a pickup , knocking the truck off an overpass . Seven teen-agers riding in the truck were killed and two other people suffered major injuries . Peltakian was arrested and charged with driving under the influence and seven counts of vehicular manslaughter . About three weeks after the accident , he quit his job and moved_out of his apartment . * Jong Pal Kim * Age : 30 * Description : Asian male , 5 ' 7 &quot; tall , 165 lbs. , black hair , brown eyes . Kim has a silver front_tooth . * Why he is wanted : On Nov . 12 , 1989 , Kim ' s girlfriend tried to end her relationship with him . The two argued , and witnesses said Kim yelled : &quot; If I can ' t have you , no one can ! &quot; According to police , he then pulled_out a pistol and shot his girlfriend in the right temple , killing her . Police spotted Kim in 1990 in Honolulu , but he escaped . He is thought to have returned to California , where he still is wanted in the murder .
