   <HEADLINE> 4 # 600 DEATHS THAT A SIMPLE YEARLY TEST MIGHT PREVENT ; MINORITIES ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET PAP_SMEARS . WHITE_WOMEN OFTEN DON ' T GET FOLLOW-UP CARE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During her 20s and 30s , Maria Vasconez faithfully had an annual medical_checkup , including a Pap_smear to screen for cervical cancer . And then she stopped . &quot; I used to get a physical every year and I never had any problems , &quot; says the Los Angeles hair salon owner , 43 . &quot; I had always been very healthy . Nothing was ever wrong with me . We don ' t have cancer in our family . So I didn ' t see the urgency in going_to the doctor . Plus , I opened my own business , and I got so busy working. &quot; Then one day -- several years after her last Pap_smear -- Vasconez began bleeding and made a frantic dash to her doctor ' s office . Within a week , she knew the problem . She had cervical cancer . &quot; I wish someone had told me to get Pap_smears every year , &quot; Vasconez says . &quot; If you are healthy or not , go_for checkups. &quot; Vasconez was treated for her cancer three years ago and is healthy . But thousands of other women who eschew regular Pap_tests on a regular basis are not as lucky . About 4 # 600 U.S. women die of cervical cancer each year . This fact is disheartening because cervical cancer deaths would be extremely rare if women had regular Pap_smears -- which involves collecting a small sample of cells from the cervix and examining it for abnormalities . &quot; With regular screening , we would see very few cervical cancer deaths , &quot; says Dr. Cary Presant , immediate past president of the American Cancer Society California Division . &quot; When screened regularly , cervical cancer is picked_up at an early stage when cells are just beginning to change . You can treat localized cervical cancer very easily. &quot; Cervical cancer deaths have dropped dramatically since the 1950s , when Pap_tests came_into widespread use . But officials point to several unrelated factors that have stymied attempts to further curtail the death rates , including failure among women with abnormal results to seek follow-up care . * As_many as 70 % of the women who die from cervical cancer have never , or rarely , had a Pap_smear , studies show . Pap_smears are crucial to detecting cervical cancer . The Pap_test can detect abnormal cells long before other symptoms of a problem -- such_as bleeding -- become apparent . It usually takes_five or more years for invasive cervical cancer -- cancer that has spread beyond the cervix -- to develop . If the cancer is detected when it is confined to the cervix , survival rates five years after treatment are 90 % compared to a 67 % five-year survival rate for women whose cancer has spread . Various studies , however , suggest that only about 60 % of women get Pap_smears at the recommended intervals . And , in Southern California , poor and uninsured women as well as nonwhite women are far less likely to obtain an annual Pap_smear . This statistic is of particular concern because one long-term study showed that Latinas in Los Angeles County had more_than double the rates of cervical cancer compared to whites . Black_women also had higher rates than whites . &quot; We are very , very concerned about this because of the fairly large Latino population in Southern California , &quot; Presant says . &quot; It ' s also our impression that Latinos are less likely to get Pap_smears . One reason may be that there is a higher percentage of poor people in the Latino communities . There is also a higher portion of Latino women who are ( illegal immigrants ) , and they have poor access to health_care . There is a cultural barrier as well . Many times , Latino women don ' t feel as comfortable seeking Pap tests. &quot; Clearly cost is a problem , experts say . A pelvic examination including a Pap_smear can cost $ 100 or more -- a fee that may_not be paid by insurance plans that provide little preventive care coverage . One 1993 study of women ages 30 to 48 found that 43 % of the poor women surveyed had received a Pap_smear in the past year compared to 62 % of the well-to-do women . &quot; I think we ' ve probably failed to stress the continuing importance of Pap testing , &quot; Presant says . &quot; We ' ve been good about mammography testing , and rates are improving there . But I think we ' ve fallen_down a bit on Pap testing . With this low-cost screening program , women can address two of the things -- mammography and Pap testing -- that are most important to their bodies. &quot; * It is equally important , however , that all women seek Pap_tests regularly , health experts say . Studies show cervical cancer rates are increasing a disturbing 3 % per year in white_women under age 50 . Overall , about 70 # 000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed yearly in the United States , according to the American Cancer Society . &quot; For young white_women , the rate is going_up slightly , although we don ' t know absolutely why , &quot; says Dr. Barry Kramer of the National Cancer Institute . &quot; It could be for a variety of reasons . It could be because human_papilloma_virus may be more common than in the past. &quot; Human_papilloma_virus is a sexually transmitted disease that is epidemic among college-age people , especially whites . Some strains of the disease are strongly linked to the later development of cervical cancer . Doctors are eager for more research on the link between HPV and cervical cancer , Kramer says . One problem with Pap_smears now is that about 10 % of all test results fall_into a vague category that are not quite normal or abnormal . But a better understanding of HPV might give doctors a new way to predict which women with these hard-to-classify test results are at high risk of developing cervical cancer . Researchers plan to study women with these vague test results who also test positive for human_papilloma_virus to see if having the virus confers a greater chance of developing cervical cancer . Despite the difficulty in classifying some Pap_test results , the accuracy of the test has improved dramatically in recent years , experts note . In previous years , Pap screening was plagued by a high rate of &quot; false negative &quot; results -- abnormalities that were missed by lab technicians . But state regulations to improve laboratory testing have lowered the error rate , Presant says . &quot; We know in the past there have been quality_control problems in Pap testing . But we ' re much more confident of testing now , &quot; he says . Moreover , the National Cancer Institute now has a nationwide system to better classify abnormal and normal results , Kramer says . The new terminology -- called the Bethesda System -- was adopted by the NCI a_few years ago to help standardize Pap results . &quot; The Bethesda System has helped us develop a lexicon of terminology that is easily understandable , &quot; Kramer says . &quot; It puts lesions into more crisp categories that are easier for the doctor to act_upon . In spite of that , there is still uncertainty about how to manage certain lesions. &quot; * But deaths from cervical cancer will only decline if consumers , too , take Pap_tests seriously . A new study by the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center showed that as_many as 30 % of women who get Pap_smears and have abnormal results do not return for either their results or follow-up care , says Dr. Celia Kaplan of the Los Angeles-based center . Poor , uninsured , single and very young_women are least likely to follow recommendations for follow-up care . &quot; People ( with abnormal results ) are usually referred to another facility for treatment , which is a main reason there is a lower return rate , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s usually farther away . It demands another appointment . And you may have to take_time_off from work. &quot; The study showed that some women , especially those in the country illegally , may_not give correct addresses or phone_numbers to clinics performing the Pap_tests . &quot; You would n ' t believe how much this interferes with good medical_care , &quot; Kaplan says . &quot; The problem with the Pap_test system is that it only informs you . And sometimes it ' s difficult to locate women for follow-up care . Women should at least provide an accurate address . Because if an abnormality is found , you can be contacted. &quot; Low-Cost Screenings To ease the financial burden , the Los Angeles Regional Family_Planning Council and the American Cancer Society are offering a low-cost Pap Package through November that includes a Pap_smear and pelvic exam . These examinations -- mammography is also available -- will be offered at 350 family_planning clinics . For information on the program , call ( 800 ) ACS-2345 . Cervical Cancer Rates Latinas have more_than doubled the rate of invasive cervical cancer compared to white_women , according to a 1987 survey in Los Angeles County . The higher than average rates in Latinas and African American women may be related to how often the women receive Pap_smears to screen for early signs of cancer . The lack of screening may also account_for an unusually high death rate for African American women who develop cervical cancer . Who Gets Cervical Cancer * Whites : 9.5 Latinas : 21.7 Blacks : 17.0 Chinese : 12.4 Japanese : 6.6 Who Dies From Cervical Cancer * Whites : 3.0 Latinas : 5.5 Blacks : 6.5 Chines : 4.5 Japanese : 3.0 * Average annual rate per 100 # 000 in L.A. County , 1972-87 Facts on Cervical Cancer * Risks Women who had sexual_intercourse at an early age , have had multiple sexual partners or have been infected with human_papilloma_virus are at higher risk for the disease . Smokers are at higher risk . * Warning signs Early signs are abnormal uterine bleeding or spotting and abnormal vaginal discharge . Pain and systemic symptoms are much later signs of the disease . * Screening An annual Pap_smear and pelvic examination are needed for all women older than 18 and those under 18 who are or have been sexually active . After a woman has had three of more annual exams with normal readings , the Pap_test may be performed less frequently at the discretion of the physician .
