   <HEADLINE> U.S. WILL SEEK 2-STEP EMBARGO FOR N . KOREA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration has decided to press for a two-stage economic embargo against North_Korea , calling_for limited economic sanctions initially , followed by a total halt in trade , if Pyongyang does not give inspectors access to its nuclear plants . The outlines of the draft proposal , hammered_out over the weekend in consultation with South_Korean and Japanese officials , were described Monday to diplomats from Britain , France , China and Russia , whose approval is key for any action by the U.N. Security_Council . U.S. and foreign officials said the proposal has strong South_Korean and Japanese backing . South_Korean President Kim Young Sam and Japanese Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata announced their support Monday for stiff action by the United Nations . But Administration strategists and diplomats cautioned there is little likelihood of any real U.N. moves until next week , at the earliest , after other Security_Council members have time to study documents and suggest changes . The developments came as President Clinton , in Europe for the 50th anniversary of D-day , sought to avoid escalating the dispute with Pyongyang , saying there &quot; still is time for North_Korea to change its course &quot; and avoid imposition of sanctions . The United States is &quot; not trying to provoke North_Korea &quot; and is only asking that country ' s leaders to &quot; do what they promised to do , &quot; Clinton said in a television interview . &quot; We want them to become a part of our world. &quot; The U.S.-South Korean-Japanese draft language came amid a flurry of meetings in New York , where diplomats from the three countries met to develop their strategy . Madeleine Albright , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , met briefly with South_Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo . Later , Albright conferred_with envoys of key Security_Council member states . Separately , the State_Department said Peter Tarnoff , undersecretary for political-military affairs , will travel_to Seoul and Tokyo on Wednesday to discuss political issues . Although China has said it is too soon to consider imposing sanctions against North_Korea , Washington is counting_on Beijing to support -- or at least not veto -- a compromise proposal , particularly if it involves a two-stage plan . Diplomats said the Chinese &quot; did not tip their hand &quot; in discussions with U.S. officials Monday but agreed with the &quot; general objectives &quot; of encouraging Pyongyang to cooperate fully with international inspectors . But senior Chinese military officials quietly met with the North_Koreans in Beijing in what some Western diplomats speculated may be an attempt by the Chinese to prod Pyongyang to go_along with the thrust of the allies ' demands . Both U.S. and foreign officials declined to provide details of the draft plan -- particularly on how broad the initial round of sanctions might be . But they said it would involve more_than the usual routine warning that such resolutions often provide . The two sides have discussed limiting any initial round of sanctions to relatively mild measures in an effort to avoid provoking Pyongyang into withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . Times staff writer Rone Tempest in Beijing contributed to this report .</TEXT>
