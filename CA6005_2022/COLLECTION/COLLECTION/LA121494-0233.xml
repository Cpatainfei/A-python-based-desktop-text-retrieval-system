   <HEADLINE> FIGURES BEHIND PROP . 187 LOOK_AT ITS CREATION ; INITIATIVE : WORDING OF THE ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT MEASURE IS UNDER HEIGHTENED LEGAL SCRUTINY . ITS DRAFTING WAS A COMMITTEE PROJECT , ITS CHIEF SPONSOR SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Throughout the fall election campaign and in state and federal courtrooms since , Proposition 187 has been repeatedly attacked as poorly written . &quot; It looks as if this was enacted or drafted by one person drafting one section and some_other person drafting another section , &quot; a U.S. district judge declared last month before blocking most portions of the sweeping ballot measure from taking_effect immediately . Well , says the initiative ' s chief sponsor , the anti-illegal immigrant measure was drafted by committee . Moreover , proponents say they are proud it was prepared that way . &quot; We had a committee of 10 and I worked with each and every member to make_sure every word was written and approved by them , &quot; said Ron Prince , who chaired the pro-187 &quot; Save Our State &quot; campaign . With the fate of Proposition 187 resting squarely in the courts , the wording of the get-tough initiative is under heightened legal scrutiny . If judges conclude that its language and intent fly in the face of state or federal statutes or the U.S. Constitution , it will not matter that it was approved by a 59 % to 41 % margin . Just like the 1964 state initiative that banned anti-discrimination housing laws but was later declared unconstitutional , the key provisions of Proposition 187 would simply never take_effect . The next major court date for the measure is scheduled today in Los Angeles before U.S. District Judge Mariana R . Pfaelzer , who will decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction halting the measure ' s implementation until the legal questions are resolved in prolonged court hearings . Already , a state court judge in San Francisco and U.S. District Judge W . Matthew Byrne Jr . in Los Angeles have issued temporary restraining orders raising constitutional questions about the initiative , which would bar illegal immigrants from public educational , non-emergency health_care and social_welfare services . Just how was the measure stitched together and what was the thinking of its authors ? In a series of post-election interviews , they said : * The drafting of the measure was a group effort undertaken by a committee that included an unemployed accountant , a political consultant and a civilian police employee , as well as a state legislator and the nation ' s former top immigration officer . Many of the initiative ' s key elements were eventually reviewed on a piecemeal basis by the state legislative counsel ' s office , but the measure as_a_whole was never reviewed by state lawyers and few changes of_import were suggested or made . * Knowing that an educational ban would stir inevitable legal challenges because of a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling ensuring free public schooling for undocumented youngsters in Texas , some members of the &quot; Save Our State &quot; committee had deep reservations about whether to include a ban . However , after lengthy debate the committee agreed to do so in_order to maintain the support of Orange County grass-roots activists who would be circulating the petitions to earn the measure a place on the November ballot . * Although Harold Ezell , the most publicly recognizable leader of the pro-187 movement , was long billed as the initiative ' s co-author , the former western regional director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service actually contributed no more_than a handful of the words that appeared on the ballot . * Some leading sponsors , in hindsight , have second_thoughts about the wording of the initiative , which calls_for each educator , health administrator and law_enforcement officer to report people he or she &quot; reasonably suspects &quot; of being illegal immigrants to state and federal authorities . Ezell , in particular , wishes the word suspects had never been included , because of its inflammatory nature . &quot; There ' s no need to run red flags up like that , &quot; Ezell said . &quot; It fanned the flames of the opposition . . . . To me , the word should have been better defined. &quot; Because the proposition won by an overwhelming margin , several sponsors say the exact wording should now make little difference . &quot; They ' re picking it to death , &quot; said co-author Alan C . Nelson , a Sacramento-based attorney and director of the INS during the Reagan_Administration . &quot; The initiative sets_forth the general principles and we ' d have the state follow up with regulations and implementing procedures. &quot; Moreover , many pro-187 voters appear angry that the measure has been blocked from taking_effect by eight lawsuits filed by civil_rights groups and government entities , including the Los Angeles Unified School District . However , legal_experts say the wording must play a key role in the ultimate fate of the initiative . &quot; The court has to decide whether this law as written is constitutional , not whether some imaginary law that could be_better drafted is or is not constitutional , &quot; said USC constitutional law professor Erwin Chemerinsky . &quot; Whether the law meets due_process , whether it denies equal protection , the court has to consider : Is this statute constitutional ? &quot; In issuing a temporary restraining order , Judge Byrne declared that the sections banning health and social_services appear to conflict with federal laws . The initiative also does not provide_for hearings before or after suspected illegal immigrants are denied government services . That , said Byrne , raises &quot; serious questions &quot; whether the initiative violates the constitutional right_to_due_process . Proposition 187 was spawned last fall_in discussions among Orange County political consultant Robert Kiley ; his wife , Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley ; and Prince , an accountant who has been without work for three years , according to his recently filed bankruptcy papers . To test the waters , Prince , who had previously launched an unsuccessful petition drive calling_for lawyers in California to be re-examined every four years , stood outside a Vons supermarket in Tustin , seeking signatures for a vaguely defined anti-illegal immigration initiative . Next , Barbara Kiley called Ezell for expert assistance . &quot; When the ( Kileys ) came_to me , I thought they were talking_about illegal immigration in Yorba Linda , &quot; Ezell recalled . &quot; So they came_in and we talked for a_couple_of hours about illegal immigration and its impact and they knew very little about it at the time . It was a business consideration for them at the time . that ' s their business -- campaigns . &quot; Two hours later , this guy by the name of Prince comes_in -- he was the guy who originally talked to them about it. &quot; As it turned_out , Prince had big things on his mind : specifically , a national constitutional convention concerning immigration . &quot; Prince ' s original idea , &quot; said Ezell , &quot; was some cockamamie constitutional amendment that was so far out it had nothing to do with the issues we had in Proposition 187. &quot; At a subsequent Oct . 5 meeting at the members-only Center Club in Costa Mesa , the committee expanded its ranks to 10 , including Nelson , Assemblyman Richard L . Mountjoy ( R-Arcadia ) and Barbara Coe , an Anaheim Police_Department civilian employee who headed the grass-roots California Coalition for Immigration Reform . Mountjoy quickly convinced the group that a state ballot measure denying public_services to illegal immigrants was the best option . Meeting for much of the day , the group divided into subcommittees to explore what public_services to ban . The most contentious issue that day and at the committee ' s subsequent sessions in Ezell ' s Newport Beach office concerned the public education ban and the litigation that would surely result . &quot; This was the most controversial part , &quot; recalled Coe , who said her coalition considered the ban a must . &quot; ( Some committee_members ) said , ' Oh boy , ' and we said we knew it would be an ' Oh boy. ' But the result was everyone finally agreed if we were going_to do_it , do_it all_the way or not bother. &quot; Coe also insisted that the initiative require parents or guardians of schoolchildren to provide proof of_their_own legal residency . &quot; It ' s the whole logical overview , &quot; Coe said . &quot; What we are trying to do is resolve the overall illegal alien problem. &quot; Soon after the Oct . 5 meeting , Nelson worked_up an initial draft , according to Prince and Nelson , who refused to make a copy public because of the pending litigation . In Nelson ' s draft , Prince said , several different terms were used to describe people to be reported to immigration authorities . Among them : those &quot; determined or believed to be in violation of federal immigration laws , &quot; those &quot; known or believed to be &quot; in violation of the laws and anyone &quot; arrested for a crime who is suspected of being present in the United States in violation of U.S. immigration law. &quot; Eventually , the wording of several sections was modified -- at the suggestion of either the state legislative counsel ' s office or Nelson , according to various committee_members -- to require each health , educational and social_welfare entity to report those it &quot; determines or reasonably suspects &quot; of being illegal immigrants to the state_attorney general and the INS . The measure fails to define in detail why a person would be reasonably suspected . Prince and Nelson -- as well as Gov . Pete Wilson , a leading Proposition 187 advocate -- say suspects would be people who fail to provide documentation of legal residency status when applying for public benefits or after having been arrested for another offense . But Nelson acknowledges that in hindsight , &quot; people misunderstood it. &quot; &quot; If we knew we ' d get all this flak , &quot; he said , &quot; it would have been very easy to say the definition of suspect is failure to provide documents and take_away any doubt. &quot; Ezell , for his part , calls the terminology &quot; probably the biggest goof in the wording . &quot; When I saw it , I said , ' Holy Toledo , what is this ? ' &quot; he said . &quot; It won ' t be in any other propositions that ( I ) have anything to do with. &quot; Prince said that at Mountjoy ' s request , he drafted the only parts of the measure not blocked by Judge Byrne -- sections providing new sanctions for the manufacture or use of fraudulent citizenship documents and a severability clause stating that if one portion of the initiative is ruled invalid , other portions could still take_effect . The wording for the severability clause came from other ballot measures , according to Prince . &quot; I wrote it myself , &quot; he said , &quot; largely plagiarizing other initiatives. &quot; Prince said he chose the wording for the false-document section -- which was later unsuccessfully introduced as state legislation by Mountjoy -- to avoid affecting young Americans using fake identification for such purposes as purchasing alcohol . &quot; I didn ' t want American kids in_trouble , &quot; he explained . &quot; But if an illegal alien is trying to hide his citizenship , that then is now going_to be a major felony in California and it should be. &quot; However , law_enforcement officials say the initiative ' s wording leaves it doubtful whether many illegal immigrants or document manufacturers will receive stiffer penalties than in the past . Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block says that because the initiative does not address the issue of possession of false documents , a suspect would have to actually use a fake identity_card in_order to face arrest . Prince , who has no law_degree or law_enforcement experience , says Block and Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , both of whom opposed Proposition 187 , are wrong . In the wake of their electoral success , some committee_members now seem at_odds on how portions of the initiative were drafted . Prince says Nelson was responsible_for the education , health and law_enforcement sections . Prince then did some editing of these sections , he says , and distributed copies of rough drafts to committee_members for comments and approval . Prince says that he also faxed copies to Mountjoy ' s Sacramento office for review by the legislative counsel ' s office , but that what few changes were suggested were mainly for grammatical purposes . Mountjoy counters that he was responsible_for the initiative since he had previously introduced illegal immigration bills , unsuccessfully , in the Assembly on topics covered by Proposition 187 . &quot; It was just stuff I was doing , when I ran_into these people , &quot; he said . &quot; It was also a group effort , basically along the lines of : ' Can you live with this ? Can you campaign on this ? Can you stand_up and justify this ? ' &quot; Mountjoy says that he showed most portions of the measure to the legislative counsel at one point or another and that among the suggestions made were to include the phrase &quot; reasonably suspects. &quot; Without that wording , Mountjoy said , education , health and social_service administrators who turned_in names might be sued if suspects turned_out to be legal residents . &quot; I think that ' s a good clause , &quot; said Mountjoy . &quot; You clear yourself of liability. &quot; Mountjoy did credit Nelson with suggesting one major concept -- providing illegal immigrant students a 90-day grace period before being tossed_out of school . That provides time for the INS to conduct deportation hearings , Mountjoy reasoned . Ezell was listed as a co-author because he was_better known than other committee_members and was serving as a spokesman , sponsors say . But his role in writing the measure was limited to six words , according to Prince . &quot; In Section 9 , I left_out the reference_to the INS . He pointed it out and I made the correction. &quot; Ezell , who hosted the committee ' s sessions , sees things differently . &quot; The designation that Nelson and I had was co-author , &quot; he said . &quot; If that means you , in long hand , write it out , then that ' s not what I think co-author is . Co-author is pulling the parts and pieces together. &quot; As it turns_out , Proposition 187 is different from many initiatives because it is written in such easy-to-read English . In the state ballot pamphlet , the measure took_up just more_than one page . In contrast , Proposition 186 , the unsuccessful health_care reform measure , filled 16 pages . &quot; Some of these petitions look_like you could build a house out of them , &quot; said Robert Kiley . Regardless , the &quot; Save Our State &quot; committee ' s approach may prove in the long_run to have serious , even fatal , consequences . Different sections of the initiative contain different definitions of who would be barred from receiving public_services . Moreover , the initiative does not use the same terminology as the federal_government for declaring who is eligible for services . Byrne cited both points before issuing his restraining order . &quot; In two sections , they list ( as legal residents ) . . . a citizen of the United States , an alien lawfully admitted as a permanent resident , an alien admitted lawfully for a temporary period_of_time , &quot; said Byrne . &quot; ( But ) they leave_out of that certain people that the federal_government would assume are entitled to benefits or really are , quote , legally in the country. &quot; Elsewhere in the initiative , Byrne added , &quot; They use totally different language. &quot;</TEXT>
