   <HEADLINE> A ' CLASSICS COLLECTION ' : WAR STORIES AND MORE ; MOVIES : TWENTY-FIVE FILMS MADE BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN 1929- ' 46 TO BE RELEASED ON VIDEO IN JULY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In case you need reminding of just how dramatically the world has changed in the last 50 years , look no further than &quot; The Classics Collection , &quot; a compilation of 25 films made by the_British government that is scheduled to be released on home video in July . Culled from an archive that includes upward of 25 # 000 films , the initial &quot; Classics Collection &quot; -- films made from 1929-1946 -- focuses for the most part on World_War_II and is , among other things , a nostalgic evocation of the last romantic war ( the atomic weaponry that came at the end of that conflict finished_off any romance associated with war for good ) . &quot; Welcome to Britain , &quot; for instance , was a film made in the 1940s to acclimate U.S. soldiers to the ways of England . Featuring appearances by Burgess Meredith , Danny Kaye and Bob Hope ( who worked for free as part of the war effort ) , the film explains such things as the finer points of how to behave in a British pub . Structured as a series of corny vignettes , &quot; Welcome to Britain &quot; makes going_to_war seem like a summer vacation abroad . With a release date near the 50th anniversary of D-day , &quot; The Classics Collection &quot; is the first of many British historical films that will soon be making their way into U.S. video stores . The property of the_British Crown Archives , which will be the beneficiary of any profits , this vast library of unexploited material is also being marketed to the U.S. film_industry as an untapped resource . ( It should be pointed_out , however , that the archive , which recently opened an office in Los Angeles , consists_of finished films only and doesn ' t include stock footage. ) &quot; These films have been available in the U.K. for quite some time , &quot; says Peter Steel , head of Footage File , a department of Britain ' s London-based Office of Information , formed in 1947 . &quot; With the growing market in home video and the anniversary of D-day coming_up , this just seemed like an auspicious time to make the films available in America . &quot; Most of the films were made prior to the arrival of television , at a time when people often got public_service information from short films , usually made by the government , that were shown in movie_theaters , &quot; adds Steel . &quot; So , these aren ' t documentary_films -- they ' re informational films that deal with everything from health concerns to how World_War_II was progressing . Because they were made by the government , I suppose some people might call them propaganda , but that word is a bit harsh for these films , most of which were intended to boost morale. &quot; * Although the informational films do tend to be relentlessly upbeat , they nonetheless provide a fascinating record of daily life in wartime Britain ( a time when virtually everyone smoked , on the evidence provided here ) . Of greater interest , perhaps , are the films that intercut actual news footage with scripted sequences , including &quot; D-day to Paris , &quot; which includes film of the final stages of the battle to liberate Paris . After release of &quot; The Classics Collection , &quot; the BCA hopes to release several feature_films drawn from 300 included in the library . &quot; We have several dramatic films that had theatrical releases at the time they were made -- ' Western Approaches , ' for instance , which was made in 1944 and is one of the first color films , &quot; Steel points_out . &quot; It was made to commemorate the merchant seamen who lost their lives in convoys in the Atlantic and is of particular interest because the cast is composed of real seamen . Equally noteworthy is ' The True Glory , ' a montage of news footage of the war that was directed by Carol Reed and Garson Kanin and won the Oscar for best documentary feature of 1946 . &quot; One of our earliest films is ' The Drifters , ' which was made in 1929 by John Grierson , who ' s considered the father of documentary filmmaking , &quot; he continues . &quot; Alfred Hitchcock did two films for us during the war ( &quot; Bon Voyage &quot; and &quot; Adventure Malgache &quot; ) , Peter Greenaway did a_few in the early ' 80s ( among them a profile of fashion_designer Zandra Rhodes ) , and Edward R . Murrow , Laurence Olivier and Richard Attenborough all narrated films for us . * &quot; My favorites are the lovely black-and-whites made during the later part of the war , &quot; he adds . &quot; There ' s one titled ' Listen to Britain , ' for instance , that ' s basically a brief introduction followed music and effects . The point of the film was to illustrate that the U.K. was carrying_on as normally as it could , despite the fact that we were at war . A similar film is ' Worker ' s Weekend , ' which shows a crew of workers building an entire aircraft bomber in just 24 hours . The film is about enthusiasm and the importance of commitment to the war effort . The war films were made to boost morale , and they don ' t deal much with the damage wrought by the war , because people were already well aware of that. &quot; Although the archive ' s films tend to focus_on England ' s economy and industries , British culture does surface occasionally , as in &quot; Instruments of the Orchestra , &quot; made to educate people about the symphony_orchestra , and &quot; Steps of the Ballet , &quot; which is similarly structured . As to the audience for this far-flung collection of films , Steel says &quot; that ' s impossible to predict at this point. &quot; &quot; With the war films , many of which deal with the finer points of ships and aircraft , I would imagine aircraft buffs might be interested . We recently did several presentations at the Museum of Flying in Santa Monica , and the audience was really fascinated with the films . Fortunately , it ' s not necessary that the films be hugely profitable , &quot; he adds , &quot; because , as a government_agency , we just need to break_even in_order to keep the series going. &quot; In addition to marketing old films , Britain ' s Central_Office of Information continues to make new films -- or , videos , to be exact . &quot; Around 1974 we began shooting mostly on video , &quot; says Steel , &quot; although occasionally we still use 35-millimeter film. &quot; Today , COI ' s public_service films deal with the same subjects that dominate American informational films , such things as AIDS awareness , drug prevention and prenatal care . &quot; The library continues to grow because we ' ve never stopped making films , &quot; said Steel , &quot; and eventually films from the ' 60s and ' 70s will become part of ' The Classics Collection.
