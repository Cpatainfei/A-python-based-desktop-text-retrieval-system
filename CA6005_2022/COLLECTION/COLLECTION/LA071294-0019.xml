   <HEADLINE> DOLLAR FALLS AGAINST MARK , YEN ; DOW OFF ; MARKETS : ANALYSTS BLAME G-7 INACTION FOR THE WEAKNESS IN U.S. CURRENCY . YIELDS ON 30-YEAR TREASURY_BONDS RISE TO 7.73 % .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar plunged Monday to its lowest level against the German mark since late 1992 and hit a post-World War II low against the Japanese yen after the United States and its allies failed to devise a plan to stabilize the greenback . Meanwhile , Treasury_bond yields rose , forcing prices lower amid expectations that the economic reports due out this week will show faster growth and rising inflation , leading to higher interest_rates . Stocks followed the dollar and bonds lower . In New York , the dollar was quoted in late trading at 1.530 marks , down from 1.563 on Friday . The U.S. currency fell to 97.75 yen , the lowest close since the late 1940s , from 98.05. The dollar dipped for the first time below 97 yen around midday , but it recovered later on concerns about the leadership succession in North_Korea and Japan ' s uncertain political situation . Analysts attributed the weakness in the dollar , which also fell sharply against other major currencies , to the apparent lack of concern for its persistent slide shown by leaders of the Group of Seven at their weekend summit in Naples , Italy . Although traders had not expected any coordinated G-7 action to support the dollar -- such_as adjusting official interest_rates to favor the U.S. currency or the nations directing their central_banks to intervene -- the failure to even mention exchange_rates in the group ' s final statement was taken as a sign that the economic powers are leaving the dollar ' s fate to the market . Dealers said trading volume was fairly light as few large banks entered the market , exacerbating the dollar ' s downward trajectory against European currencies . Much of the activity was speculative , they said . In the bond market , the yield on the Treasury ' s key 30-year bond rose to 7.73 % from 7.69 % on Friday . Its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , dropped 11 / 32 point , or $ 3.44 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Analysts described bond_trading as light , with many participants taking_a_breather after Friday ' s heavy activity as they awaited government reports on producer inflation today and on consumer inflation Wednesday . Bond prices plunged and yields soared Friday after the government reported stronger-than-expected job growth last month . The report sparked fears that strong economic_growth will fuel inflation , which erodes the value of bonds . The falling dollar Monday added_to those worries , since a drop_in the greenback ' s value tends to lead to higher prices for products imported into the United States . Michelle Laughlin , an economist at the Sanwa Securities unit of Tokyo-based Sanwa Bank Ltd. , said market participants worldwide are worried that the Federal_Reserve_Board has not raised interest_rates fast enough this year to try to curb inflation . &quot; All market indexes right now signal a Fed policy that ' s too accommodative , &quot; Laughlin said . &quot; The Fed is behind the curve in fighting inflation . We have produced more dollars than individuals desire to hold. &quot; Stock investors do not like rising interest_rates because they increase corporate costs and make fixed-income investments relatively more attractive . On Wall_Street , the dollar ' s slide pulled blue_chip stocks lower , ending a five-session advance . The Dow Jones industrial average ended 6.15 points lower at 3 # 702.99 , recovering on late buying from a session low of 3 # 681 . Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 9 to 8 on the New York Stock_Exchange on light Big Board volume of 222.97 million shares . On Friday , 236.52 million shares changed hands . Broad market indexes fell . The NYSE composite index fell 0.61 to 247.50. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller companies fell 0.63 to 706.83. The Standard &amp; Poor ' s index of 500 stocks fell 1.49 to 448.06. Among the market highlights : * Eli Lilly said it will buy McKesson Corp. ' s PSC Health Systems Inc unit . Lilly , which said it will probably have to borrow about $ 2.5 billion as part of the planned $ 4-billion purchase , shrank 7 3 / 8 to 50 . McKesson soared 24 3 / 4 to 98 . * American Cyanamid rose 1 3 / 8 to 57 , aided by an upgrade from Lehman Bros . to &quot; buy &quot; from &quot; outperform. &quot; * First USA dropped 2 3 / 4 to 37 1 / 2 . The company said it had acquired the contracts and most of the assets of Electronic Processing Source Inc. for First USA common_stock . * Dell Computer said it will stop selling products through retail_stores .
