   <HEADLINE> GOING FOR GOLD AT SURFING EVENTS ; ECONOMY : MERCHANTS , SPONSORS ARE BANKING ON BIG FINANCIAL REWARDS FROM THE OP PRO AND THE U.S. OPEN CHAMPIONSHIPS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Surf ' s up here , and Sebastian International Inc. is hoping to catch a wave . So the Woodland Hills-based hair salon products company is bringing more_than 2 # 000 people to Huntington Beach ' s Waterfront Hilton next week for a convention and sales force pep_rally tied to the company ' s role as a major sponsor of the inaugural U.S. Open of Surfing . Sebastian will also be introducing a new_line of products . &quot; We ' re involved with the U.S. Open because surfing is something that forms trends in clothing , music and people ' s lifestyles , &quot; said Michael Hastings , Sebastian ' s executive_vice_president . Standing to gain just as much are local businesses and the city itself . Merchants are counting_on a strong boost from surfers and fans at the U.S. Open , as well as from corporate guests of the contest ' s sponsors , including Coca-Cola , Chevrolet and Haagen-Dazs . And they are hoping that , when conventioneers and visiting dignitaries aren ' t working , they ' ll be eating , drinking and shopping around town . * City officials see an opportunity to improve an image tarnished by Fourth_of_July disturbances two years in a row and scenes of police_officers in riot gear trying to clear the downtown streets . Late-night violence this year resulted in more_than 50 people being arrested on a variety of charges , including public drunkenness and failure to disperse . To counter that negative picture , the televised surf coverage to be provided by Prime Ticket &quot; is publicity that you can ' t buy , &quot; said Diane Baker , president of the Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau . &quot; It ' s all about building image and pride . &quot; We are a beach community , and we market ourselves as 8 1 / 2 miles of beautiful beach . that ' s what people are going_to see on TV. &quot; Many surfers and fans are already arriving for the 13th annual Ocean Pacific Pro Surfing Championship ( Op Pro ) , which runs_through Sunday . The Op Pro serves as a qualifying event for the U.S. Open , which begins Tuesday and runs_through Aug . 7 and is the first Assn . of Surfing Professionals ' world tour event on the U.S. mainland since 1991 . City officials say they ' re prepared_for the thousands of beach-goers expected to jam the beach in downtown Huntington Beach during the next two weeks . The Op Pro is expected to draw as_many as 5 # 000 fans on weekdays and 20 # 000 people daily on the weekend . For the U.S. Open next week , attendance is expected to soar . &quot; We ' re prepared_for the maximum-case scenario , which is 25 # 000 people a day for the qualifying days , jumping to 50 # 000 on Friday and 100 # 000 daily on Saturday and Sunday , &quot; said Ron Hagan , Huntington Beach ' s director of community services . Nor do local officials expect violence like the beachfront riot that marred the Op Pro in 1986 . &quot; The year after the riot , we changed the logistics . We haven ' t had a problem since , &quot; Hagan said . &quot; We don ' t let people get inebriated on the beach , we eliminated the bikini contest , and we don ' t have live bands . &quot; We ' ve changed the event from a ' Beach Blanket Bingo ' type thing to a major sporting event . You don ' t get the party animal types . . . you get the person who ' s interested in &quot; sports . There are early signs that beachfront businesses are doing_well . Aaron Pai , owner of Huntington Beach Surf &amp; Sport on Main_Street across from the pier , reports that his shop has already sold_out of two shipments of U.S. Open T-shirts . * Hotel space is scarce . Sebastian International , for example , was able to book enough rooms at the Waterfront Hilton for the first_half of its convention but will have to move to a Long_Beach hotel for the second_half . Baker , of the Conference and Visitors Bureau , said it ' s too early to predict just how much additional business the two surf events will generate . &quot; we ' ll have a much better idea in the next few days , &quot; she said . &quot; But we think the Huntington Beach area and its neighbors , including Fountain Valley and Newport Beach , should benefit. &quot; Huntington Beach officials see potential gains far beyond image enhancement . Surfing fans will use city-owned garages and will patronize beach-area food concessions that generate tax_revenue for the city . &quot; We ' re hoping that lots of people show_up , park in our garage and buy_food , &quot; Hagan said .</TEXT>
