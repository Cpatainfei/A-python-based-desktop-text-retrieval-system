   <HEADLINE> ZEDILLO CONFRONTS CHIAPAS REBELS TODAY ; MEXICO : NEW PRESIDENT WILL VISIT SOUTHERN STATE FOR INAUGURATION OF GOVERNOR . GUERRILLAS ARE DETERMINED TO HALT CEREMONY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A week after taking_office , President Ernesto Zedillo today confronts guerrillas threatening to renew a long-simmering rebellion as well as thousands of protesting peasants converging on the capital of the deeply divided and nearly lawless state of Chiapas . Rebels and peasants are determined to halt the inauguration of Gov.-elect Eduardo Robledo Rincon , candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , who they say was elected by fraud Aug . 21 , the same day the president was chosen . Zedillo has said he is equally determined that Robledo will take_office , returning a sense of order to this impoverished state that many contend has become ungovernable . &quot; Welcome to the nightmare , &quot; were the opening words of a communique to Zedillo released Tuesday by the charismatic rebel leader known as Subcommander Marcos . While Marcos stopped short of declaring war , the sentiment building in recent weeks has swollen the numbers in the state ' s 16 refugee shelters from 2 # 800 in early August to 4 # 094 at the end of November . Peasants in rebel-held territory fear a return to the violence that shook Mexico during the first 12 days of January . At least 145 died in the fighting that began New Year ' s Day when the guerrillas , calling themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army , after the turn-of-the-century Indian revolutionary Emiliano Zapata , briefly occupied four county_seats near the Guatemalan border , demanding democracy and better living conditions . In contrast to the fearful peasants , soldiers at a checkpoint on a road out of this state_capital toward rebel-held territory have erected a Christmas_tree made of lights . Whether Chiapas does become a nightmare is likely to be determined largely by today ' s developments . Those events will set the tone for Zedillo ' s relationship with hard-line opponents , from protesters to the Zapatistas , who have observed an uneasy truce with the government since mid-January . In the wake of protests in several states , Zedillo ' s predecessor , Carlos Salinas de Gortari , took a conciliatory line with opposition parties , installing interim governors and promising new elections -- though those have yet to take_place . That set a precedent , some observers say , for winning elections in the street rather than at the polls . The new president has shown his willingness to work with other parties by appointing a right-wing opposition party member as attorney_general and by meeting Tuesday with legislators of all parties . However , he has indicated that he is less amenable to negotiating with angry crowds blocking statehouses to prevent inaugurations . &quot; We cannot make right supposed wrongs by committing other wrongs , &quot; Zedillo told the 500 Mexican congressional representatives during his meeting with them , referring to post-electoral conflicts in Chiapas and Tabasco states . To show his support for Robledo , the president is expected to attend the inauguration , whose exact location was still uncertain late Wednesday . As this morning ' s ceremony neared , the two sides appeared to be at a stalemate . About 2 # 000 peasants have arrived here , determined to prevent the inauguration . Miguel , 26 , a peasant leader from the village of San Ignacio el Gringo , near the border with Oaxaca on the north , said he had joined the five-day march to the capital &quot; because we want the governor we elected. &quot; Like many of those interviewed , he refused to give his last_name for fear of reprisals . As groups of protesters arrived , they marched along the capital ' s palm-lined boulevards in orderly rows under police escort and settled into the main plaza in front of the Statehouse . Unarmed police guarded the building with barricades that looked_like bicycle_racks . Throughout the day Wednesday , protesters waved fists in the air and chanted slogans such_as , &quot; If there is no solution , there will be a revolution , &quot; when television_cameras approached , then dispersed to find shade when crews left . Amado Avendano , the defeated candidate for governor , rejected Robledo ' s offer of a seat in a coalition Cabinet and repudiated as &quot; bluster &quot; a statement issued by authorities after his weekend meeting with Interior Minister Esteban Moctezuma Barragan . The six-point statement was said to ensure a peaceful transition of power and to permit peaceful protests . Avendano stood with Marcos and other armed guerrillas at a news_conference for about 170 reporters in the remote village of Aguascalientes when the rebels said the inauguration of Robledo would mean an end to the cease-fire . &quot; The period of peaceful resistance in Chiapas ends the moment that Mr. Eduardo Robledo is inaugurated and usurps state executive power , &quot; the ski-masked , pipe-smoking Marcos said . &quot; Beginning when Eduardo Robledo takes_office , anything can happen. &quot; Avendano will be recognized as governor in rebel-held territory , which includes parts of three huge rural counties , he added . Robledo has said he would resign if the Zapatistas put_down their arms . But the rebels have consistently refused to do that , saying weapons provide their only leverage in dealing with the government . The Zapatistas have already broken_off peace talks with the government . They had threatened a return to violence if they believed the Aug . 21 elections to be fraudulent , as they now say they do , and if Zedillo was inaugurated Dec . 1 . &quot; Each of those dates created panic in the state , &quot; said Jose Luis Albores , president of the local Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; We are a short way from a collapse. &quot; Zedillo told Congress on Tuesday that he recognizes that the violence in Chiapas is the product of desperation caused by injustice , abandonment and misery . Despite generating much of Mexico ' s oil , natural_gas and hydroelectric power , Chiapas is among the country ' s poorest states , and its poor are overwhelmingly Indians . &quot; We must attack the violence at its roots , in injustice and poverty , &quot; Zedillo said . However , he also warned , &quot; We can only build peace if everyone is willing to negotiate , which means giving_up something. &quot; More on Chiapas * Reprints of &quot; The Roots of Rebellion , &quot; the March 6 Los Angeles Times Magazine recounting of a journey on the Chiapas rebels ' road , are available from Times on Demand .
