   <HEADLINE> TALE OF DEADLY IRANIAN NETWORK WOVEN IN PARIS ; TERRORISM : AN ASSASSINATION TRIAL ' S THREADS LEAD AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA , UNCOVERING A WEALTH OF SPY DATA ALONG THE WAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was almost a perfect crime . Three well-dressed men walked into the suburban compound of Iranian exile Shahpour Bakhtiar in broad daylight , passed_through X-rays and metal detectors manned by 24-hour police guards , slit his throat and disappeared . At first , it appeared to be a brilliantly plotted conspiracy , aided by luck . Then came the mistakes . Now , three years later , those mistakes have not only led to the capture of key suspects in the case but have produced a windfall of Iranian spy data for Western intelligence agencies . In a trial that opened here Wednesday under massive security , three suspects share the defense dock with the shadow of the state of Iran -- all accused by French investigators of playing a direct role in planning and carrying_out the political assassination of Bakhtiar , a former Iranian prime_minister . What began as a murder case has unveiled the shape of what investigators regard_as a surprisingly sophisticated Iranian intelligence and terrorism network that stretches from Europe to California . French authorities report : * That Southern California , a region with an Iranian community of more_than 500 # 000 people by several estimates , &quot; is an operational base &quot; of VEVAK , the state intelligence and security agency of Iran that monitors opponents of the regime worldwide . The California community is dominated by Iranians who fled the Islamic revolution and includes many leading critics of the regime . Consequently , says one of Europe ' s leading anti-terrorism authorities , &quot; the most important base of Iran ' s secret_service is in California ; &quot; * That Iran ' s young , KGB-model spy network is now able to carry_out its own assassination missions , rather than farming out such assignments to less disciplined terrorist groups ; * That secret_agents of the Iran government have infiltrated opposition and exile groups in Europe , the Middle_East and California , often targeting their leaders for assassination . &quot; Iran seems to regard political assassination as its national right , even on foreign soil . Any country that enforces its laws against murder is seen interfering in the sovereign affairs of Iran , &quot; said one high-ranking French justice official . Iran strongly denies the allegations . In an interview , Iranian ambassador to France Hamid Reza Asefi said that Bakhtiar posed no threat to the security of Iran and that Iran had no role in his death . &quot; Moreover , we deplore any such act of violence against any resistance group , &quot; Asefi added . In unraveling the mystery of who killed Bakhtiar and pursuing the primary suspects in a network of perhaps 100 major and minor accomplices , French investigators were led_on detective hunts to Switzerland , Turkey , Britain and the United States . Results of that search are contained in a 185-page report obtained by The Times . It lays_out a case that French journalists call &quot; an autopsy of Iran ' s terror network. &quot; That network , French investigators say , includes operatives in the United States . &quot; But I fear Washington is not sufficiently concerned , &quot; said one French official . In January of 1993 , a team of French police investigators followed their trail of conspiracy leads to Los Angeles as they looked_for possible suspects in the logistic_support of the killers . They took testimony from one Iranian exile who denied any involvement but said he had been solicited to kill Bakhtiar by Iran intelligence_agents two years earlier . Still , the_French team was frustrated in part because the U.S. attorney ' s office in Los Angeles , citing inadequate probable_cause , refused to issue an arrest_warrant requested by the investigators and turned_down another request for a search_warrant . A U.S. Justice_Department spokesman would not comment on the case except to say : &quot; We cooperate and assist foreign law_enforcement investigations in the United States aggressively and to the fullest extent permitted by our laws and procedures. &quot; But one French investigator said : &quot; We told them ( U.S. officials ) there is a network of terrorists operating in your country . The Americans seemed to resent being told. &quot; Ironically , a month later terrorists attacked the World Trade Center in New York . The French had no advance knowledge of that plot . &quot; But we delivered the earlier wake-up call , &quot; the_French investigator said . Allegations of official Iranian involvement with terrorists are not new_to the United States . Last year Iran was linked indirectly to the World Trade Center bombers when it was claimed that Tehran provided financial assistance to related radical groups in Sudan . The U.S. State_Department , in its most recent report on global terrorism , implicated Iran in a series of murders in Italy , Pakistan and Turkey that were &quot; carried_out by professional assassins &quot; who eluded arrest . The same State_Department report claims that &quot; acts of terrorism are approved at the highest levels of the Iranian government &quot; and that Iranian intelligence_agents &quot; stalk members of the Iranian opposition in the United States &quot; and throughout the world . In Paris over the past 10 years alone , six Iranians have been killed in attacks attributed to their political activities . FBI officials say that more_than five years ago an Iranian dissident was killed in California in a murder that remains unsolved . And Iranian opposition leaders in Europe say 50 have been murdered worldwide since 1984 . &quot; One reason all these assassinations have continued is because the Iran government has had to pay no price , &quot; said Shaul Bakhash , a historian and Iranian expert at George Mason University . &quot; That is one reason the_French case is so important. &quot; On trial this week are : * Ali Vakili Rad , 35 , suspected of being one of the killers and a VEVAK secret_agent ; * Massoud Hendi , 47 , a grandnephew of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and former Paris correspondent for Iran ' s government-run radio and television service , who is accused of helping the killers obtain false documents to enter France ; * Zeyal ( Zia ) Sarhadi , 28 , a nephew of President Hashemi Rafsanjani and a member of the Iranian foreign service attached_to Tehran ' s embassy in Switzerland . He is accused of aiding the killers ' escape through Geneva . All three deny involvement in the alleged conspiracy . France will try six others in absentia . They are : * Mohammad Azadi , 34 , believed to be an agent of Iran ' s intelligence service , and Farydoun Boyerahmadi , 41 . Both are accused with Vakili Rad of killing Bakhtiar . * Hossein Sheikhattar , 44 , a top adviser to Iran ' s minister of telecommunications ; Mesut Edipsoy , 34 , an Iranian-born Turkish citizen ; Gholam Shoorideh , 34 , an Iranian businessman with interests in Southern California and Chicago ; and Nasser Ghasmi , 44 , also an Iranian businessman . All four are accused of conspiring to aid the assassins . Prelude to Murder Based on interviews and access to French investigative files , this is the prosecutors ' account of the Bakhtiar assassination and what its investigation reveals about Iranian intelligence_operations around the world . Shahpour Bakhtiar , 76 , lived_in comfortable surroundings on the River Seine in the west Paris suburb of Suresnes . But he could never be completely comfortable . A detachment of French state police occupied posts at his front_door , in his back yard and in the ground_floor entry to his trilevel home -- a constant reminder of his jeopardy . As a longtime champion of a democratic Iran , he had been imprisoned by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi . When the shah saw his rule slipping , he named Bakhtiar as prime_minister . Bakhtiar ' s tenure lasted barely a month before the Islamic revolution of 1979 swept him away . Bakhtiar fled to Paris , where he issued tapes and tracts seeking to moderate and unite some of the more extreme opposition factions . He was declared a target of Islamic punishment by Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhali for &quot; making a campaign against Imam Khomeini. &quot; In the summer of 1980 , he escaped a botched assassination attempt that left a policeman and a neighbor dead . A second policeman was crippled by a gunshot wound . Investigators said the would-be assassins were hired guns . A Palestinian was convicted . &quot; Tehran has improved its quality_control since those days , &quot; said a French official familiar_with the latest Bakhtiar case . Police beefed_up their protection , but anti-Bakhtiar plots continued . Fariborz Karimi , an Iranian exile living_in Southern California , told French investigators that in 1989 , while on a trip to Frankfurt , he had been asked by an Iranian secret_service agent to &quot; execute Shahpour Bakhtiar. &quot; According to his account , which is included in the_French investigative report , he was later contacted by Ali Falahian -- then assistant to the chief of VEVAK ( today he heads the intelligence agency ) -- demanding to know why Karimi had not already assassinated Bakhtiar when he was a guest in the former prime_minister ' s home . Another assassination occurred in April , 1991 . Bakhtiar ' s chief_assistant in the National Movement of the Iranian Resistance was stabbed to death in Paris by assailants who escaped undetected . Bakhtiar called a meeting in July to select a successor . A member of the resistance movement attending that meeting was Farydoun Boyerahmadi . He placed flowers on an empty chair reserved for their lost colleague . After the meeting he placed a call to Istanbul . By that time , Iranian secret_agents had set_up a clandestine dispatch center in two Istanbul apartments . French authorities now believe that Boyerahmadi was checking in with the agents there , who were the operations managers of the assassination plot . The Istanbul dispatch center was provided by Mesut Edipsoy , an Iranian-Turk who allegedly had ties to the Turkish underworld . He owned or rented the two apartments . Edipsoy , also known as Edybnia in the United States , traveled frequently to Orange County and Los Angeles , investigators said . The nature of his business dealings was not clear , but French officials believe he was in regular contact with VEVAK agents . In fact , French authorities suspect that Edipsoy may have acted_as a courier serving Iran ' s spy network in California . Central to the assassination plot from its inception were two Iranian secret_agents -- subsequently identified by the_French as Vakili Rad and Azadi -- who would be sent to France to rendezvous with Boyerahmadi . To get the killers into France , investigators contend , officials of various government ministries in Tehran conspired to help the assassination team obtain false travel documents . It was a pattern of conduct , they allege , that Iran uses around the world . Through the Ministry of Telecommunications and the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting offices , for example , French visas were sought falsely claiming that the two Iranian secret_agents were actually businessmen on an electronics shopping trip . While the phony visas were being sought , the Iran Foreign Affairs Ministry separately issued false Iranian passports to the secret_agents and later dispatched one of its own employees to Geneva to help bring the agents home , French investigators say . Meanwhile , in Istanbul other final arrangements were being made . A master forger was employed to create counterfeit Turkish passports and additional phony Swiss visas . And in Paris , Boyerahmadi secretly notified the Iranian agents that the housekeeper and gardener of his friend Bakhtiar were leaving on extended vacations , French officials say . The Last Visitors Through the month of August , apart from a private secretary and all_the police guards surrounding his house , Bakhtiar would be alone . At 5 p.m. on Tuesday , Aug . 6 , 1991 , Boyerahmadi drove his red , older-model BMW to the Bakhtiar home , where he often did odd jobs , escorting Vakili Rad and Azadi . The men wore suits . Boyerahmadi had both men change into black_ties , a gesture of respect for Bakhtiar , who was still in mourning over the death of his close friend and executive assistant . Bakhtiar was expecting them and they had no trouble with the guards or metal detectors . They were unarmed . Based on autopsies and other forensic evidence , police investigators believe this is what happened next : The younger_men joined Bakhtiar in his living room , presenting him with a painting , a gift . Bakhtiar ' s private secretary served tea , then retired to the terrace off the kitchen . Police guards noticed Boyerahmadi sitting with the assistant shortly after 5:30 p.m. That left Vakili Rad and Azadi , a large and powerfully built man , alone with Bakhtiar . Police say one of the two men struck Bakhtiar with a paralyzing blow to the throat , possibly with a forearm chop , crushing the older_man ' s larynx . He could neither cry_for help nor breathe . Then , with a butcher_knife and bread_knife retrieved from Bakhtiar ' s kitchen , they stabbed him 13 times in the neck and shoulders -- then cut his throat . They also cut his wrists and removed Bakhtiar ' s Rolex watch as &quot; a trophy , &quot; police said , to prove they had accomplished their mission . Bakhtiar was dead when his secretary returned from the terrace and was similarly slain . Calmly and efficiently , exhibiting uncommon discipline and professional skill , the assailants cleaned_up the most visible signs of blood on their clothing . The knives were returned to the sink . The phone was taken_off the hook . A wastebasket was placed between a window and the fallen body of the secretary as camouflage . Bakhtiar ' s body was left on the sofa where he had been slain , a tablecloth draped over him like a blanket . At 6 p.m. , as scheduled , the three visitors left the house . Police noticed nothing unusual . They drove_away in the BMW , passing_through the Bois de Boulogne , a large wooded park in western Paris . The two secret_agents changed into fresh clothes and dumped their bloody suits and shirts in a curbside trash_bin at the edge of the park . Discarded as well were their shredded Iranian passports . They had now assumed the identities of Turkish citizens named Musa Kocer and Ali Haydar Kaya . Boyerahmadi dropped Vakili Rad and Azadi at a subway_station then abandoned his car with its bloodstained upholstery in a predominantly Iranian neighborhood , known locally as Tehran on the Seine . It would not be noticed for days . So far , everything had gone according to the carefully laid plans that French investigators say were devised in the offices of Tehran government ministries . Meanwhile , at the Bakhtiar house all was_quiet . Police guards making their regular rounds of the compound grounds every 15 minutes dutifully entered in their logs the initials : &quot; RAS &quot; for rien a signaler , meaning &quot; nothing to report. &quot; Errors of a Mission The Istanbul dispatch center was set_up to handle emergencies . But in the aftermath of a perfectly executed assassination , the phones were silent until almost midnight . that ' s when the secret_agents made their first mistake . Neither Vakili Rad nor Azadi spoke French . Traveling without Boyerahmadi for the first time since arriving in France , they were bound for the small Savoy-region resort town of Annecy , near the_Swiss border . It required a train change in Lyon . But Lyon has two train_stations -- and they got_off at the wrong one . They missed their connection to Annecy and called Istanbul for help . Days later a taxi driver would recall for police investigators that &quot; the big one , &quot; Azadi , had used the pay phone outside the rail station . The Istanbul center was compromised and , with it , all_the contacts made by its agents believing they were beyond surveillance in Turkey . Meanwhile , at Bakhtiar ' s home no one noticed that the private secretary failed to make his regular morning visit to deliver the day ' s agenda . Sacks of groceries , dropped_off at the door as usual , were not retrieved all that day . The phone was constantly busy , not unusual given Bakhtiar ' s heavy phone use . Police failure to discover the crime was giving the fleeing killers a considerable head_start . But such unexpected good_fortune was making other Iranian agents anxious . There were no press bulletins to confirm the assassination . Istanbul agents made a costly blunder the next morning . Even though Vakili Rad and Azadi had already checked_in , they phoned an Iranian woman in Paris whose role as an undercover intelligence_agent for Tehran had been unknown to French authorities . &quot; Any news of Bakhtiar ? &quot; the Istanbul caller asked . No , but she agreed to inquire . Later , armed with phone records , French police would raid the woman ' s home and discover encoding devices , a pen with disappearing ink and other evidence identifying the woman as &quot; an Iranian mole. &quot; She would not be the only covert agent compromised by the phone links . Another was an Iran Air official at Orly Airport who was believed to be involved in counterfeiting runway access badges based on evidence found in his office safe . He also was holding the long-lost wallet and passport of a French businessman , raising suspicion that they might be used to create fake identities for Iranian agents . In England , an Iranian interior_decorator near Birmingham was linked to the Istanbul operation . French officials believed he was a &quot; dormant mole &quot; for Iran intelligence . British officials arrested him for questioning . And in Southern California , French investigators believed they had found more Iranian moles but were unable to persuade U.S. authorities to detain them , as was possible under French and British laws . One French official complained that it prevented exposure of more Iranian agents operating in California and elsewhere in the United States . But Dave Tubbs , chief of the FBI ' s counterterrorism section in Washington , said : &quot; We cooperated within the bounds of the U.S. Constitution and laws . . . . Nothing was held back. &quot; Tubbs acknowledged that Iranian intelligence is_active in the United States , keeping track of dissidents and keeping its thumb on students . In fact , Southern California figures to be a hotbed of such activity since the size of its Iranian community is the largest anywhere in the world outside of Iran . California also has a high concentration of the wealthiest Iranian exiles , according to experts . Eighteen hours after the assassination , Vakili Rad and Azadi arrived_at the_Swiss border . But they had made another mistake -- they stuck their phony Swiss visa stamps into their phony Turkish passports so late that the visa stamp was still moist , arousing the suspicion of a Swiss officer . On closer examination the guard determined that the visas , supposedly issued in Tehran , bore serial numbers of Swiss consulates in France . Swiss entry was promptly denied and the Iranians were turned_over to French border guards -- who just as promptly released them . The men were not yet wanted by police . Their difficulties getting_out of France , which would continue for several more days , forced the Istanbul dispatch center to send_out repeated calls to Iran to Paris to London to Los Angeles and to other cities , each call compromising another intelligence asset and revealing more of the VEVAK network . What the agents had failed to count_on was the relative technological ease with which investigators could reconstruct records of their telephone traffic -- this , despite the fact that the fleeing assassins had used only pay phones . Pinpointing which pay phone records to analyze was made somewhat easier by another error of the fleeing secret_agents . One left his wallet behind in an Annecy phone_booth . Finally , the silence at Bakhtiar ' s home raised suspicions . About noon on Thursday , Aug . 8 -- nearly 42 hours after the killings , long enough for mold to form on the unfinished cups_of_tea -- police found the bodies . Too late , pictures of the last three visitors would be distributed to news outlets throughout Europe . Azadi and Vakili Rad finally made_it across the border to Geneva . But that is where their last round of costly mistakes occurred . Splitting_up to make_it appear each man was traveling alone , the secret_agents checked_into separate Geneva Hotels . They were to meet their contacts outside the Iran Air offices . Azadi made his appointments . Vakili Rad got lost and arrived 10 minutes late . Azadi was apparently whisked_off to Iran . Vakili Rad was left wandering the banks of Lake Geneva , trying to avoid Swiss police and waiting to be rescued . Clues and Accomplices French law_enforcement had suffered a string of embarrassments . It had failed in the first instance to protect Bakhtiar , then failed to discover the murder in a timely fashion -- providing protection , as it turned_out , for two corpses for nearly two days . Its border police had two of the suspected killers in custody for a time and released them without so_much as a routine investigation of their phony passports . In fact , it was Swiss border police who first alerted anti-terrorism investigators that the Iranian agents had tried to enter Switzerland a day after the killings . The French began to make_up for lost time . Investigators found cabdrivers and hotel_clerks who reported seeing the men , and Investigating Magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguiere could narrow his survey of public phone records . With that , the case against Iran began to form , and the dimensions of Iran ' s worldwide network of operatives would start to take_shape . A call from a Bois de Boulogne prostitute proved especially fortuitous . She had found the bloody clothes left_behind in the Paris park . Although she had cleaned them to present to a boyfriend , investigators said lab tests were still able to link the clothes to the suspects and to the murders . The first big break_in the case came_before dawn on Aug . 21 . Vakili Rad was arrested on the lake shore by Swiss police and promptly extradited to France . Bruguiere finally had a murder_suspect , a man he also believed to be an Iranian secret_agent . Later that day , with Vakili Rad captured , the clandestine dispatch center shut_down in Istanbul . The last agent monitoring the phones left for Iran . One of the lingering mysteries is what happened to Boyerahmadi , accused of complicity in the murder by vouching for the suspected killers . He made a separate exit from France at least 10 days after the killings . French investigators say he has relatives near Washington , D.C. , and in Germany . While hiding in Paris he told one witness that he was awaiting documents for a trip to the United States . Investigators speculate that he may have changed identity to enter the United States . As the trial gets under way , French investigators are confident their case will show that four Iranian government ministries -- Foreign Affairs , Intelligence , Telecommunications and Interior -- played key roles in_ordering and carrying_out a Bakhtiar conspiracy . Bruguiere , who directed the investigation , calls the legal fight against terrorism vital for the defense of freedom . &quot; Terrorism is trying to destroy our society . It ' s like a war , &quot; he said in an interview . &quot; Organized crime has an understandable goal , to make profits for its members . But terrorism seeks to destroy our values , our democratic systems . We must fight it with the arm of the law. &quot; Meanwhile , the country braces for possible terrorist attacks similar to what accompanied the trial of the Palestinian gunman accused of trying to kill Bakhtiar back in 1980 . Police have bolstered security around train_stations and major department_stores . Sharpshooters man the rooftop of the Palais de Justice . Hoping to defuse prospects of terrorist actions and help minimize the tensions between Iran and France , one French Justice Ministry spokesman insisted : &quot; This is a murder trial , not a trial of Khomeini or Rafsanjani . The issue will be simply this : Who is the murderer and who is the accomplice ? &quot; For the remnants of the Bakhtiar resistance group , the trial has much broader implications . Ali Chakeri , 57 , who replaced the fallen president , accuses Iran of mounting an international campaign to exterminate dissent . &quot; We don ' t care so_much if the accused suspects are convicted , &quot; Chakeri said in a discreetly arranged interview . &quot; What is most important to us , the victims of this violence , is that Iran is convicted. &quot; Times staff writer Ronald J . Ostrow in Washington and researcher Sarah White in Paris also contributed to this story .</TEXT>
