   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL-JORDAN MEETING PAVES WAY FOR TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Jordanian Prime_Minister Abdul Salam Majali met here at the lowest point on Earth on Wednesday to pave the way for a formal end to their countries ' 46-year-old conflict . The first public summit in the region between leaders of the former adversaries was presided over by U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , who lauded Jordan and Israel for their vision . &quot; This ancient land ' s cries_for peace are finally being heard , &quot; he said . &quot; To a troubled world , you send forth a simple message that exalts our vision and strengthens our faith -- that the scars of war can be healed , the divisions of memory can be overcome , peace between Arab and Jew can be made. &quot; Anticipating White_House talks Monday in Washington between Jordan ' s King Hussein and Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , both sides hinted that they will announce an end to the state of belligerency that dates to Israel ' s creation in 1948 . At a news_conference earlier Wednesday , Hussein heralded the recent progress in relations between the two nations as the &quot; breaking of a new dawn. &quot; He said he hoped to sign a formal peace_treaty with Israel as soon as possible , although he noted that the two sides &quot; still have a long way to go. &quot; When pressed_on timing of a treaty , he replied , &quot; A month might be too soon. &quot; The king , whose secret talks with Israeli leaders have gone_on for decades but never bore fruit until now , added that Jordan is prepared to move ahead without Syria : &quot; We have taken a sovereign decision regarding our right to move. &quot; But he made clear that Jordanians shared the Syrian goal of a comprehensive peace that would end all aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict and in which Damascus would play a central role . At the talks here in the Dead_Sea , the Jordanian and Israeli delegations discussed five issues on which they hope to make progress as a foundation for permanent peace , senior U.S. sources said . These include plans for cooperation in developing areas of joint interest , roads from Jordan through Israel to Egypt , a framework for trade , civil aviation links and a transnational park . Among the ideas on the table : an airport to serve the Red_Sea tourist and port cities of Aqaba in Jordan and Eilat in Israel , and a canal to take_water from the Red_Sea to the Dead_Sea to ease environmental , water and power problems , participants said . As preliminary steps , Jordan and Israel agreed Wednesday to develop a master_plan for developing the Jordan Rift_Valley and to find means to facilitate new border crossings for third-party nationals , they said in a final communique . But much of the work they discussed will be dealt with Monday . On Wednesday , the air was thick_with accolades and historic claims by all sides . &quot; It is time for peace . The people desire it , &quot; Peres said at the opening ceremony held at a hotel overlooking the salty waters of the Dead_Sea . &quot; The land needs it . The Dead_Sea , silent and deep , may become a symbol of new life. &quot; He also said that , when Christopher first raised the idea of a direct meeting in the region six months ago , the idea seemed impossible . Now , he noted , he has a sense of frustration &quot; that we waited so_long &quot; to make_peace . And of all peace efforts with the four Arab front-line states , negotiations with Jordan enjoy the greatest public support in Israel . Majali , who also serves as Jordan ' s foreign_minister , described the talks as &quot; vital and critical moments which historians shall cherish and poets shall relish . They will be recorded in the annals of history in block_letters , for they separate the age between peace and war , construction and destruction , and even life and death , &quot; he said . The subsequent closed talks were characterized by a participant as &quot; relaxed and open . Both sides have a problem-solving approach , &quot; he said . That amiable mood offered a sharp contrast to the atmosphere that prevailed just nine months ago , when these talks were launched by President Clinton . In Washington , the United States then had to cajole low-level officials from Jordan and Israel to discuss basics ; now , in the region , independent of American mediators , senior officials from the countries are conducting friendly conversations about a range of issues . This meeting , conducted in sweltering heat , fell on the anniversary of the 1951 assassination in Jerusalem of King Abdullah , grandfather of the current Jordanian monarch , who witnessed the shooting . Peres paid tribute to Abdullah , who he said was the first Jordanian monarch to hold secret talks with Israeli leaders and laid the foundation for &quot; a unique relationship -- hidden and open &quot; that has endured erratically &quot; even in the gloomy days of open warfare . . . . The silent pledge of the wise king became the destiny of his grandson , &quot; who , Peres said , had &quot; demonstrated stamina in the face of uninvited dangers . . . and shown courage in reading impending opportunities. &quot; The changing relationship between the two states was reflected in vignettes throughout the day . A Jordanian soldier asked an Israeli official what she thought_about being in the Arab state for the first time . An Israeli journalist searched all corners of the isolated hotel for a souvenir labeled &quot; Jordan. &quot; When she couldn ' t find anything , a Jordanian gift_shop attendant offered to write it in Arabic for her on a T-shirt . At the end of Wednesday ' s talks , as he was leaving the Dead_Sea Spa Hotel to take a helicopter back to Israel , Peres stopped to invite Majali to visit Jerusalem . &quot; Thank you very much , &quot; the Jordanian premier replied . &quot; When the time is right , we will do it. &quot; But the precariousness of peace was also underscored Wednesday when Israeli warplanes hit bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah , or Party of God , in southern Lebanon . In stark contrast to their work with the Palestinians and Jordan , the Israelis and their neighbors in Syria and Lebanon have not made any breakthroughs in their peace processes.SUMMIT CONFERENCES</TEXT>
