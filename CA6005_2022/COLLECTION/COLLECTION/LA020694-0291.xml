   <HEADLINE> KEYING INTO LITERATURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Frustration was the catalyst that drove two Garden Grove brothers to start World Library Inc. , which publishes literary_works on CD-ROM . After searching reference_books for three days to find an obscure quotation from 18th-Century German philosopher Immanuel Kant , Robert Hustwit came_up with the idea of poring over great literature electronically . He and his brother , William , launched their company in 1989 and published the first edition of &quot; Library of the Future &quot; in June , 1990 . It contained the texts of 450 works of literature . The family-run business soon followed with editions that included even more text . The $ 395 third edition had 3 # 500 works plus illustrations and video clips . World Library now has 20 titles and has shipped about 200 # 000 copies . Distributors include Compton ' s NewMedia , an electronic encyclopedia publisher that is one of the industry ' s largest multimedia companies . William Hustwit said he expects sales to double or even triple this year , and the privately held company will be moving its headquarters from Garden Grove to Irvine to accommodate that growth . &quot; As more consumers buy computers with CD-ROM_drives , they want a lot more_than just text , &quot; he said . Building on its success , World Library recently started a subsidiary to go beyond the electronic book . Called Cinerom Inc. , it is headed by Hustwit ' s 27-year old daughter , Sharon . The company , a joint_venture with Hollywood Select Video Corp. , will launch in mid-February &quot; The Gospels : A Multimedia Bible Guide. &quot; The $ 49.95 title contains nearly two hours of video , more_than 100 illustrations , and audio segments of the four religious_texts of the Bible . The user will be able to listen to passages of Scripture while reading them on the screen or watching scenes from Biblical movies . Cinerom Inc. also aims to publish a series of CD-ROMs adapted from home video titles such_as &quot; The Three Stooges &quot; and &quot; Our Gang. &quot; In effect , the subsidiary will create interactive movies , Sharon Hustwit said . While &quot; Library of the Future &quot; appealed_to researchers and book_lovers , she said , &quot; I think Cinerom will have a wider appeal , especially among younger people. &quot; As improved data storage techniques enable the company to put as_many as six movies on a single disc , William Hustwit said , the CD-ROM could be a rival to the videocassette . &quot; You could watch all three parts of ' The Godfather ' on one disc , &quot; he said .
