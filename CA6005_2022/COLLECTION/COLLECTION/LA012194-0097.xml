   <HEADLINE> SHOWDOWN VOTE WILL DECIDE POLITICAL REFORMS IN JAPAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite threats of a rebellion among its own supporters , Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s coalition Thursday decided to put to a final vote today four political reform bills that would overturn Japan ' s post-World War II political structure . Rejection of the bills , on which Hosokawa has staked his political future , in the upper house of Parliament would undermine Hosokawa ' s power to act_on a host of other issues , including conclusion of yearlong negotiations with the United States to establish a framework for U.S.-Japan economic issues . Hosokawa , who said last August that he would &quot; assume political responsibility &quot; if the reforms failed to pass , is scheduled to visit Washington Feb . 11-13 to wind_up the &quot; framework talks &quot; with President Clinton . With party discipline cracking on both sides in the upper house , the historic vote will mark the first time that representatives cast ballots without the outcome being known in_advance . Hosokawa described the showdown as dangerous . Excluding the Speaker of the 252-member upper house , who does not vote , 126 votes are needed for passage . Although the coalition counts 131 members in its ranks , leaders fear that as_many as 16 Socialists will vote against the bills or boycott the balloting . A rebellion is also expected within the Liberal Democratic Party , which opposes the bills . The Liberal Democrats ' 38-year grasp on power ended last July . The reforms would wipe_out a lower house election system in which an average of four representatives are chosen by voters casting only one ballot in multi-seat districts . Candidates are sometimes elected with 20 % or fewer of the votes cast . Under the proposed reforms , voters would cast one ballot for a representative in single-seat districts , filling 274 seats , and a second ballot for the party of their choice to fill 226 proportional_representation seats . The weight of rural votes , which is often three times that of urban votes , would also be reduced to a ratio of 2 to 1 , on average . Corporate and union donations , which have been blamed as the root of widespread corruption , would be forbidden to individual politicians . Under the system now , battles in multi-seat districts among politicians of the same party reduce lower house campaigns to personality contests . National issues and foreign_policy are seldom mentioned . Hosokawa ' s struggle to win approval of the reforms came_to a head Thursday as a Liberal Democrat defied his party and cast a vote_in committee to send the package to the floor of the upper house . With the move by Tomoichi Hoshino , who said he will resign from the party today , the bills passed_by a vote of 18-16 .</TEXT>
