   <HEADLINE> FIRST AND GOAL ; FLAG-FOOTBALL TOURNAMENTS ARE CATCHING_ON BIG-TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s drawing_close : Super Bowl Sunday , that holiest of days for American sports fans , the January afternoon when the faithful approach a state of oneness with their sofas . It is a feast_day , of beer and pizza and chips consumed before the flickering altar of the television_set . Among televised sports , pro football might be considered the unrepentant couch potato ' s last sanctuary . Basketball fans can head to the court for a pickup game , tennis fans make court appearances of_their_own , bowling fans bowl while baseball fans can join softball leagues . Meanwhile , fans of the Mighty Ducks can take_to the rink for the fast-rising sport of roller hockey . Football fans have fewer outlets . Other_than tossing a Nerf ball around the living room , or hitting the street for a quick game of catch during the halftime show , most adults who watch football rarely get the chance to play . In no other U.S. sport are there so many spectators and so few participants ( a fact borne_out by statistics from the National Sporting Goods Assn . in Mt . Prospect , Ill. ) . It ' s a situation that the National Football_League is trying to remedy -- with some success , judging by the early results . As part of the build-up to last year ' s Super Bowl , the league launched Draw_Play , two weekend flag football tournaments ( in Woodland Hills and Mission Viejo ) leading to a one-day playoff -- called NFL Experience -- in Pasadena , site of the Big Game . The tournament is back this year , rechristened Air-It-Out and expanded from an exclusively Southern California event to nine NFL markets across the country . The tournaments started in Green_Bay , Wis. , in August and wind_up this weekend at UC Irvine , after having returned to Pierce College last week . This year , the number of teams competing in the tournament in Southern California has gone from about 215 teams per site to about 350 . New cities have caught_on quickly as well : Air-It-Out tournaments in Miami and Dallas drew about 500 teams each . The response has &quot; been beyond our expectations , &quot; said Don Garber , who oversees Air-It-Out as vice_president for development of NFL Properties in New York . He says the tournament is a grass-roots attempt to increase interest in the game of football . &quot; It allows fans to get a little closer to the game , &quot; Garber said . &quot; The idea is to get these armchair quarterbacks out and give them the opportunity to play. &quot; Chuck Price ( who promotes the regional finals of the annual Hoop-It-Up three-on-three basketball tournament in Huntington Beach ) oversees the Southern California Air-It-Out tournaments , and was the man in_charge of coming_up with the rules for the game . In flag football , the players wear long fabric ribbons on each hip . The ball_carrier is downed when an opposing player pulls_off one of the flags . Because it is safer than tackle football and can be played without expensive pads , flag football is popular as an intramural college sport and with some city recreation departments . Most adult flag football_teams use seven-person teams and employ blocking . Price wanted smaller teams and no contact . The game he devised is played_on a field 60 yards long and 25 yards wide , with four people on the field for each team ( each team is allowed one substitute ) . The 30-minute game ( rules are printed on Page 13 ) emphasizes passing and plenty of scoring . &quot; It ' s a real fun time more_than anything , &quot; Price said . &quot; The idea is to feel_like John Elway , feel_like Michael Irvin . We let your typical football fan get a touchdown , do a dance in the end zone and go_back to work_on Monday. &quot; Go_back to work , it is hoped , without bumps and bruises or more serious injuries . &quot; You can extend ( to catch a pass ) and not worry about getting hit , &quot; Price said . &quot; We have a lot of guys playing who are over 40 years old. &quot; The deadline for entering this year ' s Air-It-Out tournament at UCI has passed , but the fast-paced event is open_to spectators . Former football stars who want to relive past glories have another opportunity , however : a new flag football_league that has adopted the Air-It-Out format . San Clemente-based Fast Action Sports has held two seasons so far since the last Super Bowl , in Costa Mesa , Cerritos and Woodland Hills . Deadline for entering next season ' s play is Feb . 1 . Dan Anderson is head of Fast Action Sports , which also sponsors a popular adult basketball_league program in Orange County . He got involved in the flag football_league after seeing the success of last year ' s Draw_Play tournament . Football , he said , &quot; is not a big participation sport , when you consider it ' s such a huge spectator sport . . . . Our idea is , get_out and play . Participate. &quot; Chris Valois quarterbacks the team that won the Mission Viejo Draw_Play tournament last year . His team -- the Chicoutimi Cucumbers ( nickname of former Montreal Canadiens goalie Georges Vezina ) -- will be back at UC Irvine this week , and has played in both seasons of the Fast Action Sports league so far . &quot; It ' s great . It ' s like playing_out in the streets when we were kids . ' Everybody get open and I ' ll hit you at the curb , I ' ll hit you at the mailbox , ' &quot; Valois said . &quot; It ' s competitive , but it ' s under control. &quot; The 32-year-old Irvine resident guesses that the mean age for the league is 28 to 30 , with a_few players in their 40s ( the minimum age is 21 ) . One team has a 48-year-old quarterback and a 56-year-old receiver , Anderson said . He can only remember two women who have played in his leagues so far , but added that because the game emphasizes speed and strategy over size , more women might give_it_a_try . Said Garber : &quot; It ' s a throwing game , that ' s why we call it Air-It-Out . The nature of the rules and the format stress fun and safety. &quot; Joshua Charles , a player from Hawthorne , agreed : &quot; Basically , it ' s a lot of passing . You ' ve got_to have at least average speed to compete , because you ' re running constantly. &quot; Charles , who plays in the Cerritos league ( his team is the Dawg Pound ) , played football in high_school , but hasn ' t had much of an opportunity to compete since then . &quot; I didn ' t play it in college , so I guess ( the league ) is a way for me to go_out there and play_out that dream , &quot; he said . League seasons last eight games , followed by a playoff in which every team participates . &quot; There ' s a definite atmosphere when you get_to the playoffs , an extra intensity , &quot; said Gerry Janecko of Torrance , who played in the Costa Mesa league last season . &quot; There ' s a little bit of trash talking going_on . It ' s a little like old times. &quot; Janecko played football in high_school , but hasn ' t played much since . &quot; It ' s tough to find a flag football_league out here , &quot; he said . Janecko likes the four-on-four format , although he said defenders are at a slight disadvantage ( because they can ' t bump the receiver at the line_of_scrimmage ) and he ' s not fond of the rule that forbids runbacks of interceptions . &quot; Other_than that , everybody ' s pretty happy with it , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re liking it . It ' s pretty addictive. &quot; Jason Maciel of Buena Park , who plays in Cerritos , plays_on a team ( the Bomb Squad ) with two of his brothers . Because a quarterback is allowed only seven seconds to throw , the pace is always fast , he said . &quot; It ' s kind of like a run and shoot sort of thing , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s hard to go_deep all_the time . Jeff Zielinski of Bellflower , who plays in the Costa Mesa league ( on a team with three of his brothers ) , played intramural flag football in college and had a little trouble getting used to the no-contact rules of the new format . But , he discovered , &quot; it turns_out to make the game a little cleaner. &quot; Zielinski said each team usually scores four or five touchdowns in the 30-minute game . It ' s a format that prizes strategy and playing experience as much as size or even speed , he believes . &quot; It ' s a lot of fun . It ' s set_up really well for the recreational players . The fastest players and the biggest players aren ' t necessarily going_to win. &quot; Heads Up ! Air-It-Out Coming to O.C.
