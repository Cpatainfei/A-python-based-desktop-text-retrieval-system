   <TEXT> In darkness , two men in orange spacesuits trudge across the Mojave salt flats to take their seats in the cockpit of a spectral SR-71 . Sitting on the Tarmac , the supersonic spy plane is blacker than a moonless midnight . A dozen civilian technicians in jeans and T-shirts tinker with the temperamental aircraft , as rivulets of jet fuel stream like sweat_off its wings and angular fuselage . It is a pre-dawn scene that could be drawn from the secret annals of the Cold_War . There are no Air_Force blue-suiters in_evidence , however , no armed MPs or tight-lipped military spooks . Overseeing the operation is a young civilian astronomer in faded Guess jeans and a white cowboy shirt , her waist-length brown hair held_out of her eyes by sunglasses pushed_up on her forehead . The stealthy craft is bound not for forbidden airspace over Russia or North_Korea , but for the stratosphere above Los Angeles , where UCLA researchers will use its unique high-altitude capabilities to calibrate sensors designed to monitor the health of Earth ' s atmosphere . The mission is one small symbol of a fundamental change transforming the conduct of science in the United States after the Cold_War . A receding tide of defense funding has exposed an unexpected peace dividend : a windfall of laboratory facilities , once-secret apparatus , and sophisticated technology , like the SR-71 , developed to bolster the military in the decades of conflict with the Soviet_Union . As the threat of nuclear annihilation appears to subside , scientists like Jacklyn R . Green , the planetary astronomer in_charge of the recent NASA-sponsored SR-71 flight , are scrambling to salvage such swords of high_technology and convert them into tools of basic , civilian research . It is a daunting task to even locate such technological treasures , and -- in an era of shrinking federal research dollars -- harder still to find the money to operate them . &quot; It is our inheritance from the Cold_War , &quot; she said . &quot; We own it . Our parents ' generation paid dearly for it . It is a national resource. &quot; Green , at NASA ' s Jet_Propulsion Laboratory , is at the forefront of those who are finding useful scientific work for Cold_War hardware forced into retirement . The Defense_Department retired its SR-71 fleet -- the world ' s fastest and highest-flying production aircraft -- in 1990 . Green learned of the surplus planes by chance over lunch one day and immediately volunteered to comb the scientific community for experiments suitable for the supersonic craft . &quot; It is a solution looking_for a problem , &quot; Green said of the sleek craft silhouetted in the desert dawn . Green and SR-71 project manager David T . Lux at NASA ' s Dryden Flight Research_Center now have the use of three SR-71s along with dozens of spare engines , hundreds of special 22-ply tires and other unique spare_parts worth about $ 1 billion . They also collected a cache of Thor ICBM missiles the military can no longer store and , most recently , claimed a set of supersonic Mach-3 drones designed for especially hazardous surveillance missions over Siberia and China . The Air_Force had intended to donate the once-secret drones to a museum . Other scientists also are claiming their Cold_War patrimony . At the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , marine seismologist John Orcutt is using a once-top-secret global network of hydrophones -- originally designed to track the signature swish of enemy ship propellers -- to eavesdrop on undersea earthquakes . In Newport , Ore. , geophysicist Christopher G . Fox tunes_in to the raucous clatter of underwater volcanoes off the coast of Oregon and Northern California with the same U.S. Navy network , called the Sound Surveillance_System ( SOSUS ) . At Caltech , Thomas Ahrens employs a mammoth Star Wars laser to investigate the chemistry of giant meteor impacts on ancient Earth . At the Livermore National Laboratory , research engineer Stephen Azevedo is using ultra-sensitive imaging equipment , designed to find flaws in ballistic_missile interceptors , to &quot; candle &quot; fossilized dinosaur eggs . Physicist Thomas M . Georges is tracking Atlantic hurricanes with a $ 1.5-billion early_warning_radar near Moscow , Me. , designed originally to detect incoming Soviet bombers and cruise missiles . The Air_Force spent 25 years and almost $ 2 billion developing the unusual &quot; over-the-horizon &quot; radar system , which can monitor 50 million square_miles of ocean . Georges relays his minute-by-minute radar reports to the National Hurricane Center . Marine researchers and geophysicists even are trying to claim a Navy nuclear attack_submarine for use as a full-time civilian research vessel . The Navy plans to decommission its entire fleet of Sturgeon-class attack_submarines in the coming decade . * These civilian scientists , however , are uncovering a wealth of military research tools at a time when they can least afford them . For the first time in 50 years , the federal_government and the scientific community it nourishes face shrinking budgets . If surplus military technology is more plentiful , the money to sustain it for peacetime purposes is not , experts say . For instance , earlier this month the Air_Force turned_off the Maine radar that Georges uses . Only the intervention of four U.S. senators persuaded the Defense_Department to turn it back on several days later . Nine federal laboratories and a consortium of about 60 scientists have now developed projects to keep the radar system gainfully employed , ranging from weather_forecasting and studies of ocean waves to investigations of solar magnetic_storms . So far they cannot find the $ 4 million a month to operate it , though a federal committee now is looking_at ways to keep the radar operating permanently as a research facility . Its expenses are being paid temporarily with money earmarked for drug surveillance operations . Much of the surplus defense equipment , like the SR-71 , is still so novel that it has yet to prove its utility to civilian funding agencies . While NASA has budgeted $ 3 million a year to conduct sonic_boom tests and other aeronautical research with the craft , Green must hustle to find ways for scientists like the UCLA physics team to fly their experiments for free . &quot; What we have at this point is shoestring research , &quot; Green said . &quot; We have to do this more and more because the science budget is dwindling. &quot; Beyond budgetary problems , experts say , the conversion of scientific resources is further hampered by a lingering Cold_War mentality . Researchers who want to take_advantage of the Pentagon ' s surplus scientific resources often must rely_on goodwill and the rumor mill . At best there may be an announcement on a property list or a telephone_call from a friendly military program manager . Some facilities are still so secret that outsiders may never even learn of their existence until after they have been junked . For many scientists , the most valuable resources are those that are still official secrets . Many potentially useful Defense_Department systems come under the umbrella of &quot; national technical means &quot; -- the top-secret devices that the United States has employed to keep surreptitious tabs on its friends and enemies , according to scientists involved in defense projects . Much of the equipment is managed by agencies like the National Reconnaissance Office , which , at the height of the Cold_War , was itself too secret to even mention publicly . Defense experts say intelligence agencies face a special dilemma in declassifying or discarding surveillance satellites or the sophisticated sensors used to spy on foreign countries . They must weigh whether the equipment can easily be turned against the United States , the experts said . At the request of the government , a group of 70 scientists is formally evaluating the fate of some secret systems . Their deliberations are classified , as is the panel ' s formal report , which was completed six months ago . It is not certain whether the Defense_Department and intelligence agencies will follow any of its recommendations . Nor is there any guarantee civilian funding will be available . &quot; This is a very systematic effort that has been under way for two years , looking_at everything that national security agencies manage , &quot; said Gordon J . MacDonald , an international affairs expert at UC San Diego who is chairman of the group . &quot; We are trying to determine what data and what systems , developed for other purposes , can be used to study the Earth and environmental issues , &quot; he said . MacDonald , a geophysicist who studies climate change , has straddled the line between open scientific_research and secret projects for most of his career . One small example of a once-secret system that could find new utility as a civilian research tool is a jet bomber outfitted with an array of electronic sensors for surveillance work , he said . Scientists now have shown it can be used to gather data about &quot; greenhouse &quot; gases , such_as water_vapor , in the upper atmosphere . On Thursday , the Air_Force donated the aircraft to the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo . Given the scale of the resources up for grabs , however , such official efforts are rare , experts said . Salvage operations most often coalesce around a scientist ' s outrage at seeing the opportunity of a lifetime slip_away . Capt . Robert Smart has spent the past year handling all military technology conversion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which is pursuing Pentagon castoffs like the Air_Force radar system more aggressively than any other federal agency . &quot; As far as any organized clearinghouse or anything , there is none , &quot; he said . The most effective thing he can do is &quot; talk to people and keep my ear to the ground. &quot; So far , he has been approached independently by 20 different military laboratories anxious to preserve research capabilities that are about to be abandoned . John Orcutt also has had his ear to the ground . Now director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at Scripps , Orcutt had coveted the Navy ' s extensive SOSUS undersea surveillance_system for decades before the Defense_Department declassified it . He learned of it as an operations officer aboard a Navy ballistic_missile submarine during the Vietnam_War , where he used it to play underwater cat-and-mouse with Soviet opponents . &quot; I knew about it at a time when you couldn ' t say the word , &quot; he said . &quot; The idea of using it for scientific purposes was ridiculous. &quot; Until 1989 , the $ 16-billion network was one of the country ' s most closely guarded secrets . The skein of 1 # 000 sensitive underwater microphones , encompassing the Atlantic and the Pacific , is linked by about 30 # 000 miles of cables . A map of the listening arrays is still an official secret . Orcutt built his own undersea earthquake sensors for years , knowing full well that locked behind a wall of secrecy was a worldwide system that dwarfed any research apparatus he could construct on_his_own . &quot; It is our telescope on the oceans , &quot; Orcutt said . &quot; It is potentially a revolutionary tool . The payoff from having access to that kind of data for scientific uses is potentially enormous. &quot; Only about 10 scientists have regular access to the SOSUS system today for civilian research projects , in part because a security clearance is still needed to use the data . They acquired the proper clearances in the course of other military projects . There are about a_thousand scientists , however , who might benefit from the system , if only the Navy would relax its secrecy rules enough to allow anyone to publish a detailed description of what the system can do , a committee of scientists complained . When a military system does find new life in civilian hands , the Defense_Department gets more_than gratitude in return . A discreet Pentagon agenda can still be served . Whenever the civilian SR-71 flies , project officials note , the Air_Force Space Command uses the elusive high-speed aircraft to calibrate its infrared surveillance satellites and missile detection capabilities . The civilian program , they add , also preserves the skilled personnel and irreplaceable expertise required to operate a craft that is more rocket than conventional fighter jet against a day when it again might be pressed into military_service . Indeed , Congress in August set_aside $ 100 million to reactivate the SR-71 as an operational spy plane because it can make surprise inspection flights over any given site . The plane could take_off from Edwards , gather photographs and radar imagery of all North_Korea ' s nuclear sites , and be back on the ground five hours later , defense officials said . At the same time , whenever civilian marine biologists use the Navy undersea sonar system to track California blue_whales or monitor undersea earthquakes , they are helping to preserve a unique national security network the Defense_Department no longer has the money to maintain . The Navy ' s annual budget to run the system has dropped from $ 335 million in 1991 to an expected $ 60 million next year . The SOSUS system , experts said , can serve not only as an invaluable research aid , but its unique ability to monitor subtle undersea seismic tremors makes_it an irreplaceable tool for detecting clandestine nuclear tests . Only the efforts of a_few scientists kept key listening posts in Bermuda and Iceland from being shut_down summarily earlier this year . Other segments of the extensive sea-floor monitoring system had already been destroyed . &quot; The Navy doesn ' t just turn it off , &quot; said Fox at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory . &quot; They blow it up . There are arrays that have already been abandoned. &quot; Federal_officials and scientists are now studying ways to use the system for non-military research such_as undersea geology and marine mammal studies , as well as for nuclear test ban verification . They also are looking_at whether it can be useful in the war on drugs , by tracking drug runners , and in the effort to police commercial fishing , by locating illegal drift-net fishing . * In some cases , the Pentagon has no hope of retaining its high-tech resources and is simply going_out of business as gracefully as possible . Since the Star Wars program was canceled , for example , the largest and most powerful experimental laser in the United States has been begging for customers . The million-watt near-infrared laser , known as MIRACL , was designed originally as a prototype of directed energy weapons that might one day be used to defend ships from incoming cruise missiles or to shoot_down enemy satellites . Barred from testing it against any objects in space , the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command is shutting_down the $ 800-million laser test facility -- but not before conducting an unusual fire_sale . For a limited time , any suitable civilian experimenter can use the raw sustained power of the laser to heat samples to more_than 36 # 000 degrees Centigrade for just $ 1 # 440 per blast . Many scientists , however , cannot afford the discounts or even the occasional gift . Last spring , Michael E . Field , chief of the U.S. Geological Survey ' s Pacific marine geology branch , could barely contain his glee when the Pentagon donated a surplus $ 40-million vessel for his ocean research program . The 2 # 000-ton ship , originally designed to tow mile-long cables studded with sensitive hydrophones able to pick_up the whispers of Soviet submarines sliding through the water , was twice as large as the largest ocean-going research laboratory in the Survey ' s service . It was one of several ships , all built since 1989 , that the Navy turned_over to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . &quot; We want to make_it one of the most versatile oceanographic vessels in the country , &quot; Field said when the craft docked in Redwood City last spring . But now the Worthy , as the converted craft was to be christened , is headed for mothballs . Field could not find the $ 2.5 million for the winches , computers and other sampling gear needed to turn the Worthy into a laboratory . &quot; This was was going_to be one of the swords turned_into plowshares , &quot; Field said recently . &quot; Now we are making plans to deactivate the ship. &quot; The Pentagon ' s largess , he said , had been undercut by rising operating_costs and fixed budgets in his own agency , and years of inflation . In a lament his military counterparts know now by heart , Field added : &quot; Funding in all government circles is restricted . Budgets are tight . People have to make choices about every dollar spent . What would have been easily doable three years ago is no longer feasible. &quot; New Uses for Old Weapons U.S. scientists are turning warships , &quot; Star Wars &quot; lasers , and once-secret surveillance_systems into tools of civilian research as fast as the Pentagon can throw the equipment on the Cold_War scrapheap . But few civilian research programs can afford them . Here are two of the military systems that scientists are working to salvage . Air_Force Over-the-Horizon Defense Radar Where : Moscow , Me. ; Rimrock Lake , Calif . Development cost : $ 1.8 billion Designed to : Watch for incoming cruise missiles and bombers Now being used : To Track hurricanes Status : Under review Navy Sound Surveillance_System Where : Atlantic and Pacific_oceans Development cost : $ 16 billion Designed To : Track Soviet missile-bearing submarines Now being used : To study undersea volcanoes and earthquakes , and track whales Status : Under review By triangulating the signals picked_up by sounds surveillance_system , researchers can figure_out the precise location of whales and follow them for months .
