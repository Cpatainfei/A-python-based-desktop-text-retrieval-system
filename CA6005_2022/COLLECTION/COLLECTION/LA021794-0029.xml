   <HEADLINE> ARE YOU READY FOR THE SUPER COWS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Almost overnight , the super cows have arrived and are busy producing milk that is already being sold -- without any distinguishing marks -- in supermarket dairy cases near you . On farms throughout the country , dairy_cows entering the ninth week of lactation , or the peak of their production , are being injected with bovine somatotropin , or BST , the first major product of agriculture biotechnology . Within 24 hours of treatment , the animals ' milk production can increase as much as 20 % . The exact number of farmers adopting this high science , according to Monsanto Co. , the leading manufacturer of the drug , has surpassed 2 # 000 in 46 states . Sales of BST , trademarked as Prosilac , began less than two weeks ago . The dimensions of this event can only be understood when one compares an average cow ' s current milk production of 14 # 841 pounds a year with the projected totals after BST treatments : 16 # 641 pounds . In other words , the drug stimulates the average cow to produce an additional 1 # 800 pounds of milk annually -- that ' s equivalent_to the weight of a small car such_as a GEO Metro . Even before BST , American dairymen could claim that they were producing more milk with fewer animals on fewer farms than ever before . With the advent of this drug , current production records could be shattered in a country that is already awash in a tax-supported milk surplus . * A Clinton_Administration Executive_Branch report on BST , released last month , said that the additional costs to the federal_government from implementing the animal drug will be substantial . In the first four years of BST usage , the federal Treasury will have to invest $ 510 million , in addition to current spending , to purchase excess production under current government milk price_support regulations . This prospect , and the several related health issues , have created all kinds of controversy : * Consumer advocates are trying to persuade the public that BST is bad science and are urging a boycott of the milk . * Government officials are attempting to reassure everyone that BST is safe and that milk from treated cows is no different from any other milk . * Drug_companies , which invested $ 1 billion to develop BST , are hoping the issue will quickly fade . The glare of publicity can only dampen enthusiasm for the drug and slow sales -- a frightening prospect for companies , such_as Monsanto , that are eager to recoup their huge investment . * Dairy_farmers are torn . They can use BST as a quick way to increase a herd ' s production and the farm ' s revenue . Or they can delay and await the developing public reaction to the drug . The Clinton_Administration report on BST endorsed the drug and said that government scientists believe that milk and meat from BST-treated cows is safe and virtually identical to products from untreated animals . * Even so , the Pure Food Campaign , a Washington-based advocacy group critical of biotechnology , recently filed suit in federal_court in Madison , Wis. , seeking to halt sales of BST . The Pure Food Campaign contends that doubts remain about the safety of BST and that the government has not conducted several key tests on the drug . Pure Food ' s chief complaint is that BST ' s ability to increase production will stress cows , causing the animals to develop mastitis , a disease of the udder . Any sign of mastitis and dairy_farmers would be tempted to increase the prescribed levels of antibiotics given cows in_order to keep the animals healthy . Any rise in antibiotics usage might be reflected in potentially harmful levels accumulating in commercial milk . As part of the Food and Drug Administration ' s approval of BST in late 1993 , Monsanto must conduct tests of BST-treated cows to determine whether the milk contains abnormal or illegal levels of antibiotics . &quot; First , FDA approves BST for use and then they say they will monitor how much antibiotics end_up in milk or how much mastitis is being caused in cows , &quot; complained Andrew Kimbrell , an attorney in Washington for the Pure Food Campaign . &quot; I have never heard of FDA approving an animal drug first and then deciding to do the human safety tests after the approval . . . . The public thinks that an FDA approval means that a drug is safe . It doesn ' t , and the courts should make an independent investigation ( of BST ) . &quot; * In response to these and other , similar charges , a biotechnology trade group issued a statement calling the Pure Food Campaign &quot; extremists &quot; who promote &quot; fear. &quot; &quot; I ' m confident that this lawsuit , like the other obstructionist and dilatory maneuvers before , will be dismissed , &quot; said Carl B . Feldbaum , president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington . &quot; When it is , we will no longer have our progress held hostage to baseless fears . . . . It is important to keep this issue in perspective . BST occurs naturally in all cows , whether they have been treated with BST or not . It is the substance that makes them grow and produce milk . It is present in trace amounts in all_of the milk and meat we eat. &quot; A Monsanto spokesman said BST injection and subsequent increases in milk production will not harm cows . &quot; The cow is capable of producing the additional milk and BST allows the cow to do_it , &quot; said Tom McDermott , Monsanto ' s director of biotechnology communications . &quot; In our field tests of BST , 72 % of the farmers reported that the cows produced nine additional pounds of milk a day . Similar increases can be seen from other animal management techniques such_as milking three times a day and is not harmful. &quot; The Clinton_Administration ' s BST report concedes , however , that future sales of the product are &quot; uncertain &quot; despite all_the assurances about safety . * As part of the FDA approval of BST , dairy firms that do not use the animal drug can say so on their product label . If dairies and supermarket companies widely adopt anti-BST labeling , there could be a strong consumer backlash against the compound . The Pure Food Campaign claims to have enlisted commitments from as_many as 150 national food_companies to reject the use of BST or the sale of its byproducts . Just last week , for instance , La Habra-based Food 4 Less Supermarkets Inc. announced that all milk sold in its 222 California stores will be from cows free_of Monsanto ' s BST drug . Food 4 Less operates Alpha Beta , Boys and Viva markets , in addition to its name-sake stores . California Milk Producers , the cooperative that ships dairy_products to Food 4 Less , announced that virtually all its farmer members have signed affidavits pledging not to use BST supplements , according to Gary Korsmeier , chief_executive_officer for the co-op , the state ' s largest . California Milk Producers has also provided similar guarantees , he said , to Vons Grocery Co. , Stater Bros . Markets and Hughes Markets . In fact , some surveys indicate that public concerns about BST may lead to a reduction in overall milk consumption of between 4 % and 20 % a year , which would compound the surplus issue and increase government price_supports . * Consumer resistance to BST may also dim prospects for all future applications of agriculture biotechnology , the Clinton report stated . While the report found that application of biotechnology in the medical sector is robust , the efforts in the food industry were described at &quot; fragile and financially vulnerable. &quot; One prime example is Calgene Inc. ' s Flavr Savr tomato , scheduled to debut last fall . The FDA has yet to approve the tomato ' s implanted gene that resists molding and allows vine ripening . Calgene reported last week that it lost $ 21 million during the six months ending Dec . 31 , almost double its losses from the same period in 1992 . The company announced that 1994 losses will be even greater .</TEXT>
