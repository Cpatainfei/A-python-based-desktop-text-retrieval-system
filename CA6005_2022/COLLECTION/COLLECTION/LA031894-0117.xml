   <HEADLINE> MANY SPILLS NOT CHECKED , RECORDS SHOW ; ENVIRONMENT : STATE SAYS IT DOES NOT HAVE STAFF TO VISIT EACH SITE , AND RELIES ON COMPANIES FOR AN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The oil spill blamed on Texaco by state officials this week was one of dozens of on-land spills each year that are never inspected by the state Division of Oil and Gas , the chief agency responsible_for looking_into such spills . Division records show that only one-third of on-land spills larger than 100 barrels in Ventura County were inspected in_person between 1988 and September , 1993 . Smaller spills are almost never examined because division officials said they simply do not have the staff to visit every reported spill site . The result , officials said , is a system that relies_on the oil_companies to provide an accurate accounting of how much oil has spilled , what caused the spill and how the oil is being recovered . Local environmental groups said oil_companies cannot be trusted to report spills . And , because on-land spills are so difficult to detect , they said government_agencies should be more vigilant in inspecting them . But Bill Guerard , the state oil and gas supervisor , said the agency cannot respond to every report of a spill because there are hundreds of incidents each year . &quot; We don ' t have the manpower to look_at every spill , &quot; he said . &quot; We have to prioritize our tasks. &quot; Guerard said the inspectors normally respond to incidents if the initial report indicates that oil has threatened an environmentally sensitive area . But in most instances , he said , the oil is contained behind walls or berms , and a visit to the oil field is not necessary . In the case of the spill attributed to Texaco , division officials said they never even received a report of the mishap . Officials at the State Office of Emergency Services said the report was faxed to the Ventura office of the Division of Oil and Gas on Jan . 12 , 1993 , but inspectors in Ventura said it never arrived . Even if they had received the report , division officials in Sacramento and Ventura said they still would not have visited the Texaco oil field because Texaco reported that the leak was minor and already contained in a 4-by-4-foot area . Pam Morris , a spokeswoman for the division , which is an arm of the state_Department of Conservation , said Thursday that the division has normally found oil_companies to be reliable . &quot; We ' ve found that 99 % of the reports we get from the oil_companies are accurate , &quot; Morris said . &quot; It ' s been our experience what we hear from the companies closely resembles what we find on the site. &quot; * But environmentalists said they do not approve of what they called &quot; the buddy system &quot; between the oil_industry and the agency responsible_for policing spills . &quot; History shows we simply cannot rely_on oil_companies to report the spills , &quot; said Henry Feniger , a past president of Get Oil Out , a Santa Barbara-based oil_industry watchdog . &quot; They know that it ' s not in their best interest to report a spill on land because chances are that no one will notice it. &quot; The Texaco case is one of two recent glaring examples of spills that were not accurately reported . On March 15 , Unocal Corp . was ordered by a San Luis Obispo court to pay $ 1.5 million for failing to report up_to 8.5 million gallons of a diesel-like liquid that spilled at the company ' s Guadalupe oil field . State investigators in that case said they have collected evidence of discharges at that site since 1978 and have accused the company of attempting to cover_up the leaks . &quot; It ' s pretty clear , based on what we ' ve had occur in Santa Barbara and what has happened now in Ventura , that monitoring requirements are not what they should be , &quot; said Linda Krop , chief counsel for the Environmental Defense Center in Santa Barbara . &quot; Unfortunately , government_agencies are often underfunded and they therefore allow the oil_industry to monitor itself , &quot; she said . &quot; That simply doesn ' t work. &quot; Krop said the result of self-monitoring is a system of abuse in which many spills either go unreported or are not reported accurately . According to division records , there were 14 on-land oil spills of 100 barrels or more in Ventura County since 1988 , not including the Texaco incident or the recent spill at McGrath State Beach , which occurred on the Bush Oil field near Oxnard . Some of those spills , including a 80 # 000-gallon leak at the Oxnard field of Chase Production Inc. and a 12 # 000-gallon leak at Texaco ' s Ventura field , were never visited by division inspectors . The three inspectors in the Ventura office of the Division of Oil and Gas spend most of their time performing annual environmental inspections of about 18 # 000 acres of oil fields in the county . Division Inspector Steve Mulqueen inspected the Texaco field in September , 1993 , and , according to his report , found no evidence of the 370 # 000-gallon spill , in spite of the fact that Texaco ' s own consultants found extensive soil contamination at the spill site in August . Ken Henderson , chief deputy for the division in Sacramento , said that because inspectors do not take soil samples , it is no surprise that the spill went unnoticed . &quot; There is often some oil_staining on the ground , so without a soil test , a spill like that could be missed by our inspector , &quot; Henderson said . * Still , Guerard insists that enough is being done to prevent major spills , and oil_industry officials agree . &quot; We spend enormous sums_of_money on prevention , &quot; Shell Oil Co . spokeswoman Susan Hershberger said in an interview earlier this year . &quot; We have all kinds of procedures set_up to respond to spills , and we are firm about dealing with spills immediately. &quot; But local environmental groups argue that , as evidenced by recent events , the power to police the oil_industry may be safer in independent hands . &quot; If the oil_companies can afford to self-monitor , they should be able to help pay_for agencies like ( the Division of Oil and Gas ) to do the job independently , &quot; Krop said . &quot; I think it ' s clear that if things stay the same , we ' re just inviting more abuse. &quot;</TEXT>
