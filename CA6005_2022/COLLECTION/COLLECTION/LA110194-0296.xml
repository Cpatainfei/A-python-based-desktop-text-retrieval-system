   <HEADLINE> THE NBA : 1994-95 PREVIEW ; GYM RAT TURNS INTO BIG CHEESE ; RAISED IN BASKETBALL ENVIRONMENT , MURRAY AIMS TO MAKE LEAP FROM CAL TO CLIPPERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lamond Murray , the Clippers ' top draft pick , was dunking before he was out of diapers . Murray ' s father , James , who played basketball at UC Riverside in the early 1970s , used to hold Lamond over his head so that he could dunk . &quot; When he was 3 years old he would n ' t play with his Tonka toys , Big Wheels or anything , &quot; James Murray said . &quot; Just a basketball . He used to sleep_with the ball and the ball was bigger than him . &quot; When I played_at Riverside , they had a temporary nursery set_up in the corner of the gym and the cheerleaders would baby-sit while we practiced and all he ever heard was the thump of the ball . &quot; After he got potty trained , he went everywhere I went . If I said he couldn ' t go_with me to play basketball , he ' d hide in the trunk ( of the car ) or the back seat. &quot; James Murray instilled the spirit of competition in Lamond too , at that early age . &quot; When we played , I played not to take any hostages , &quot; said James Murray , who had served a two-year hitch in Vietnam before starting college . &quot; The rules of war stipulate that if you take a hostage , you ' re supposed to give him medical_care and feed him , but over there you just shot them in the head again because you couldn ' t be dragging them through the jungle . And that was my mentality when we played . If he had the ball , he was the enemy and we just played rough. &quot; Lamond Murray practically lived and slept on the court . &quot; I put a basketball_hoop above the garage and he ' d play until he got exhausted , &quot; James Murray said . &quot; Once I found him asleep , leaning up against the ball. &quot; Lamond Murray ' s obsession with basketball has paid_off . The seventh player selected in the NBA draft , the 6-foot-7 forward from California was so highly regarded by the Clippers that they chose not to meet All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins ' price . Wilkins signed with the Boston Celtics . &quot; We are counting_on him to be an integral part of the future of this franchise , &quot; Clipper General_Manager Elgin Baylor said . &quot; No one is saying he ' s going_to come_in and turn everything around . He ' s not Shaquille O ' Neal or Michael Jordan , we all understand that. &quot; Said Murray , &quot; I think there ' ll be a lot of pressure , but I haven ' t really felt it yet because I ' m not on the floor . But I think I ' ll be able to deal with it. &quot; Whatever his future , Murray has basketball in his genes . Cousin Tracy , a former UCLA star , plays for the Portland Trail Blazers . Tracy ' s younger brother , Cameron , a 6-1 guard , is a freshman at USC . &quot; We were close until his family moved_up to Northern California , &quot; Tracy Murray said . &quot; We ' d go play ball on the weekends and stuff . Lamond always had a nice hook_shot . He got that from his dad. &quot; James Murray , 45 , and his brother , Robert , 46 , were star basketball_players at Blair High in Pasadena in 1967 . James , a 6-foot-4 power forward who was an outstanding rebounder and post player , went_on to play_at Pasadena City College in 1970 , after serving his Army hitch , then transferred to UC Riverside . Invited to open tryout camps by the Seattle SuperSonics and the Portland Trail Blazers , Murray declined because he had a wife and son to support and couldn ' t afford to leave his job . He decided he would live through his son ' s career . &quot; My dad was a big influence on me because he played ball in college , &quot; Lamond Murray said . &quot; He taught me a lot about the game , not just about shooting or defense , but about how to think the game , which I think is essential to you doing_well out there on the floor. &quot; Robert Murray , a 6-3 1 / 2 guard and an outstanding outside shooter , played_at Cal Lutheran . Son Tracy , who set a state scoring record at Glendora High before going_to UCLA , where he became the Bruins ' fifth leading scorer , inherited his father ' s shooting touch . Tracy and Lamond played together every day last summer in pickup games with other NBA players at UCLA in an attempt to prepare Lamond for the NBA . &quot; He ' s going_to do just fine , &quot; Tracy Murray said . &quot; Just let him get adjusted . When he gets adjusted and he ' s calm and playing his game where he feels comfortable , you ' re going to see the real Lamond. &quot; And there ' s another Murray on the way . Lamond ' s girlfriend , Carmen Allen , is pregnant with their first child and due next week . However , Murray might not be with Allen for the birth of their son because he ' s set to make his NBA debut Friday in Yokohama , Japan , against the Trail Blazers and cousin Tracy . The Clippers , who left today , will return Sunday . &quot; Japan ' s not the best place to be because it ' s a long flight back and by the time I get_back it ' ll probably be over with , &quot; Murray said . &quot; I want to be here for the birth of my first child . It ' s very difficult. &quot; Why doesn ' t he skip the games in Japan and stay here ? &quot; I don ' t know if I can do that , &quot; Murray said . &quot; For the amount_of_money they ' re paying me ( $ 13.5 million for five years ) , I don ' t know if I can do that. &quot; Murray and Allen , who plan to get_married next summer , have already decided to name their son Maurice , which is Murray ' s middle name . Murray has had trouble catching_up_with the Clippers after missing the first two weeks of training camp because of a contract dispute . He shot 24 % in three exhibition_games . After practicing with the team for two days , he made his debut in last Wednesday ' s 101-98 exhibition victory over the Atlanta Hawks . Murray played 12 minutes , missing all six shots he took , including three three-pointers . He wasn ' t much better in an exhibition tournament in Mexico_City last weekend , making six of 19 shots in two games . But Murray ' s poor shooting doesn ' t alarm him . &quot; I ' m not worried about that at all , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m just getting used to shooting the basketball . My elbow ' s a little sore right now . I ' ll work_through it . I ' m not worried about it. &quot; Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said Murray is a quick learner . &quot; Lamond Murray has been as good a latecomer as I ' ve ever had coaching , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; Walking into a camp as late as he walked in , he ' s walked in with very good conditioning and a great attitude . He ' s been impressive to me . Now , he ' s got_to play himself into shape . &quot; He knows the game . Very few rookies that come_in know the game . I ' ve had a lot of guys who ' ve come_out of college who didn ' t know the game as well as he does. &quot; Forward Loy Vaught agreed . &quot; Lamond has a lot of talent , poise and skill , &quot; Vaught said . &quot; I like the way he shoots the ball from deep . When he has the ball in his hands he takes his time . A lot of rookies rush , panic a little , but he seems very poised . I think he ' s going_to be great for our team. &quot; Murray , who is so quiet that he was nicknamed &quot; Mute &quot; by his high_school teammates , doesn ' t talk much on the court and isn ' t very demonstrative . &quot; that ' s the way I learned to play , &quot; he said . &quot; I couldn ' t be like the rest of the guys and talk and do all those antics and still concentrate_on the game . My way of concentrating is to be_quiet and think things out_in my head about what I need to do the next play. &quot; Fitch thinks some may misinterpret Murray ' s demeanor . &quot; A lot of people are going_to misread him because his passion for the game ( isn ' t readily apparent ) , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; He ' s one of those ' still waters run deep. ' He ' s a very within-himself guy . &quot; But if you spend some time with him , you know he ' s got a desire to succeed and win as a member of a team . that ' s what I like about him . He ' s got a ' member of a team ' attitude . &quot; At the college_level , he found time to rest . But if he learns to play in his high_gear , he ' s going_to be a very good player . He was so good at the college_level he could turn it on and turn it off. &quot; Murray admits that he occasionally loafed in college . &quot; Some nights I took_it_easy and some nights I played very hard , &quot; he said , &quot; but now I ' ve got_to play very hard every night because the competition ' s there. &quot; Murray didn ' t have much competition at Kennedy High in Fremont , where he averaged 30.7 points , 14.6 rebounds , three assists and three blocked shots a game as a senior in 1991 , en route to being named the state Division III player of the year . After signing with California , Murray chafed under former Bear Coach Lou Campanelli , who tried to refine his game . But Murray flourished after Campanelli was replaced by assistant coach Todd Bozeman midway through the 1992-93 season . He averaged 24.5 points in his last six games as Cal advanced to the Sweet 16 . And he outplayed Duke forward Grant Hill , the third player selected in the draft , scoring 28 points and grabbing 10 rebounds as the Golden Bears upset the defending NCAA champions in the second round of the 1993 NCAA tournament . Murray ' s stock rose with NBA scouts last season when he broke the school scoring record set by guard Kevin Johnson , now with the Phoenix Suns . Murray and All-American point guard Jason Kidd decided to leave school early for the NBA after Wisconsin-Green Bay ousted Cal in the first round of the NCAA tournament last March . Some maintain that Murray might have trouble playing without Kidd , the No . 2 selection in the draft , to feed him the ball . Playing without Kidd as a freshman , Murray averaged 13.8 points and shot 47.4 % . However , he averaged 19.1 points and shot 51.7 % as a sophomore after Kidd ' s arrival . The leading scorer in the Pacific 10 Conference last season , Murray averaged 24.3 points and shot 47.6 % . Murray thinks he ' ll flourish even without Kidd , now with the Dallas Mavericks . &quot; Jason , when he did get there , took a lot of pressure off me and helped me a lot with his assists , &quot; Murray said , &quot; but I think I was a pretty good player before he got there , and I think he was a pretty good player before he got_to Cal . I think we complemented each other , rather than made each other. &quot; * The Clippers waived guards Stephen Thompson and Orlando Vega on Monday to reduce their roster to 13 players . The Clippers will decide whether to keep center Matt Fish after they arrive in Yokohama , Japan for Friday night ' s season opener against the Portland Trail Blazers .</TEXT>
