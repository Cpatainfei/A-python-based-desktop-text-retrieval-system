   <HEADLINE> WORLD PERSPECTIVE / EUROPE ; POPULARITY OF FRENCH PREMIER DEFIES THE ODDS ; EDOUARD BALLADUR HAS WEATHERED ENOUGH CRISES TO SINK MANY A LEADER . BUT HIS RATINGS JUST KEEP RISING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Take your pick of metaphors . Maybe he is , as one analyst suggests , the inoxydable , or stainless_steel , prime_minister . Or perhaps he is , as another sees him , more of a buvard , an industrial-strength sponge that &quot; absorbs everything. &quot; Call him what they will , French Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur has in just 10 months on_the_job suffered enough political crises to sink many_a leader . And he has not just survived , but flourished , becoming the runaway favorite to succeed President Francois Mitterrand in 1995 . &quot; Nobody predicted Balladur would ever be this popular , &quot; said Alain Duhamel , a French political analyst . &quot; But he corresponds well to the political equilibrium in France these days . The French wanted change . They wanted a certain respectability . And they were fed up with politicians offering ready-made solutions that didn ' t work. &quot; Balladur , 64 , has had one bona_fide success in the eyes of the electorate : He took a tough line with American negotiators in talks leading to the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , exacting concessions on agriculture and entertainment that were hailed here as a great victory for France . But there has been no shortage of threats to his popularity , including the continuing 12 % jobless rate , recession , strikes and diplomatic miscues . Balladur ' s plan to cut jobs at the ailing state-run airline , Air France , touched_off an ugly strike last fall , forcing him to capitulate to strikers . Then , to general dismay , he sent two alleged Iranian terrorists , wanted by Switzerland , back to safe_harbor in Iran -- and refused to explain why , except to cite vague concerns of &quot; national security. &quot; A_few weeks ago , Balladur and three government_ministers went_to Saudi_Arabia promising to sign big arms deals for French companies , only to leave empty-handed and embarrassed . And , when he tried to sneak_in a new law increasing private_school funding a_few weeks ago , a legislative court annulled the law and 600 # 000 people still took_to the streets of Paris in protest . So how is Balladur doing after all that ? Just fine , the_French say . Recent opinion polls give him a 60 % positive rating , a tally that has been increasing steadily . Among all_the potential candidates for French presidential elections in 1995 , Balladur has the support of about 60 % of the electorate , the polls indicate . At the same time , nearly two-thirds of the_French believe they are being poorly governed . * Even Balladur admits to being baffled by the polls . &quot; It is paradoxical that the_French have evidently still a good opinion of me , and yet apparently believe they are badly governed , &quot; he told the Financial Times of London , which anointed him its &quot; Man of the Year. &quot; Oddly enough , Balladur became the prime_minister last March because he didn ' t have presidential ambitions . He was part of the conservative coalition that won 484 of 577 seats in the National Assembly last year . But the political pillars of the right , fellow Gaullist Jacques Chirac and the centrist former President Valery Giscard d ' Estaing , didn ' t want the job . They feared their own presidential aspirations would be bruised in a two-year &quot; cohabitation &quot; with Mitterrand , the Socialist president . Under the_French system , the president is elected for a seven-year term and enjoys wide powers as chief_of_state . But the prime_minister is responsible_for forming a government and directing domestic policy . On occasion , that system has resulted in battles between a president and prime_minister from opposite ends of the political spectrum . But this cohabitation has gone well , further polishing Balladur ' s reputation as a courteous , honest man who stands above the political fray . Will his popularity last ? Much will depend_on his ability to treat the ailing economy and carry_out his ambitious plans to privatize two_dozen state-owned industries . But few analysts are willing to bet against the man in the Savile Row suits who already has defied the odds . &quot; I think it ' s going_to last , &quot; Duhamel said . &quot; But it is going_to be tested . The big question is whether he will be able to give the kind of dynamic economic leadership that the_French are waiting for. &quot;</TEXT>
