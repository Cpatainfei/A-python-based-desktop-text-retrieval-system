   <HEADLINE> GEORGIA COUNTY NOW WELCOMES , BUT STILL CONDEMNS , GAYS ; PROCLAMATION : FEAR OF LOSING OLYMPIC REVENUE LEADS OFFICIALS TO ISSUE STATEMENT OF TOLERANCE , YET THEY WON ' T RECANT EARLIER DENUNCIATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a quest_for a little 1996 Olympic gold , a Georgia county whose officials last year passed a resolution condemning homosexuality decided Wednesday that gays aren ' t so bad after all . Cobb County commissioners did not rescind the earlier resolution -- that will &quot; never &quot; happen , the commission chairman vowed -- but a proclamation issued Wednesday welcomes everyone to the county regardless of sexual orientation and assures gays that they will not be discriminated against . The proclamation was approved in an effort to keep the organization that is planning the 1996 Olympic Games from yanking the preliminaries for a volleyball competition and several Olympic training sites out of the conservative county , which is just north of Atlanta . There were indications the proclamation may_not go_far enough . &quot; I ' m delighted to see some progress being made &quot; on the issue , said Billy Payne , president and chief_executive_officer of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games . He added , however , that the committee would continue to study whether the events could be moved without causing too_much inconvenience to the athletes . &quot; We ' re studying all_of the ramifications , &quot; he said , adding : &quot; I hope that reasonable folks are going_to reach reasonable conclusions. &quot; County commissioners caused a firestorm of protest last July when they passed a resolution condemning the &quot; homosexual lifestyle &quot; and cut_off all county funding to the arts in response to local production of a play , &quot; Lips Together , Teeth Apart , &quot; that contains references_to homosexuality . To pressure the county to rescind the resolution , gay activists began targeting Olympic organizers . After at first steadfastly refusing to become enmeshed in local controversies , Olympic officials -- along with local business people who fear losing the financial windfall Olympic venues will bring -- recently began urging Cobb County officials to address the issue . The county convention center expects to receive $ 500 # 000 in rent payments for hosting the volleyball preliminaries . The Olympics could pump $ 5 billion into the state ' s economy , one study said . Explaining the resolution during a press_conference Wednesday , Commission Chairman Bill Byrnes said : &quot; If someone is gay , they will be welcome in Cobb County in 1996 , as they are today . It ' s when they stand_up and say they want to be treated differently because they ' re gay that I will oppose it. &quot; He added , however , that the 1993 resolution &quot; will continue to stand . All of the threats will be of no avail in Cobb County. &quot; Gay activists questioned how the county could welcome gays at_the_same_time it condemns them , and promised to continue to protest . If the 1993 resolution is not rescinded , gays threaten an escalating campaign of protest and civil_disobedience culminating in a massive demonstration during the Olympics that would embarrass both the county and the Olympic organizing committee . Saying that his first priority was the welfare of the athletes and the staging of successful Games , Payne expressed weariness at efforts to pull the Olympics into local controversies . Among other issues threatening to tarnish the Games is a continuing battle over the Georgia state flag , which incorporates the Confederate battle emblem from the Civil War . &quot; We can ' t solve everybody ' s problems , &quot; Payne said . &quot; We prefer to just do our job of putting_on the Games. &quot;</TEXT>
