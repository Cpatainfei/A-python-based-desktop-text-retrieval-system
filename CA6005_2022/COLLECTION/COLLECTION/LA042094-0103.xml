   <HEADLINE> UTILITY REGULATION PLAN IS_DUE OUT TODAY ; ENERGY : USERS MAY GET TO CHOOSE A POWER SUPPLIER . THE ONLY CERTAINTY IS THAT COMPETITION IS COMING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the California Public_Utility Commission today unveils its closely guarded proposals for changing the way electric utilities do business , four broad options are_on the table . All are designed to accommodate the competition -- and potentially cheaper electricity -- that most believe is inevitable in this once-monopolistic field , as new technology and federal deregulation make alternative sources of power available : * Price caps : One scenario would place caps on utility company revenue similar to those used in the regulation of telecommunications firms . Efficiency gains in one area could be used to offset unseen expenses in another ; PUC hearings would be greatly simplified . * Performance-based rate setting : This approach is favored by the utilities . Power_companies would be rewarded in the rate-setting process for efficiency gains . Rates would be capped based on projected costs of operation ; if costs were reduced below the projections , the savings would be split between shareholders and ratepayers . * Limited retail market : The PUC might call_for treating different classes of customers in different ways . Big users could shop for their own electricity , while residential and commercial customers would still deal with a conventional utility . This approach mirrors the regulation of natural_gas utilities . * Retail wheeling : At the extreme is broader retail deregulation -- known as retail wheeling in the trade -- that could leave the utilities no more_than transporters , rather than producers , of electricity . Users could buy power from independent producers -- even out-of-state utilities -- and simply arrange for their local utility to deliver it . Elements of these scenarios could be mixed and matched , and each mix would have different implications for customers ' utility bills . Whether some form of retail wheeling is part of the commission ' s proposal &quot; is really the $ 64 # 000 question , &quot; said John L . Jurewitz , Edison ' s manager of regulatory policy . California would be embarking_on an uncharted path , departing from known regulatory principles in setting the price for billions of dollars ' worth of electrical_power . For more_than a year , these scenarios have been making the rounds of utility executives worldwide in a PUC document known as the Yellow Report ( for the color of its cover ) . The report , titled &quot; California ' s Electric Services_Industry : Perspectives on the Past , Strategies for the Future , &quot; amounts to a concise rundown of the basic challenges and options that regulators , electric_companies and their customers face today . &quot; It ' s probably the single most widely circulated and read document on the future of electric generation on the face of the earth , &quot; PUC President Daniel W . Fessler said . Virtually no one involved wants to leave the regulatory structure unchanged , but neither is there wide agreement on any of the solutions -- except for the broad notion that some sort of competition is inevitable . Deregulation has had varying results in different industries , but the one most often looked_at as a model for electric utilities has been the market in natural_gas . And there , many observers see success . As a rough rule_of_thumb , natural_gas deregulation is considered to be 10 years ahead of electricity deregulation in California . And the California Energy Commission reports that consumers have saved billions of dollars on natural_gas since 1983 , though a more exact figure has not been calculated . &quot; It ' s been very , very significant , &quot; said Charles R . Imbrecht , the commission ' s chairman . Applying market forces to retail electricity sales has attracted attention in disparate parts of the world , from Chile and Scandinavia to Michigan and Ohio . When Britain began to privatize its government-owned electric utilities in 1990 and gave them a clean_slate to restructure the business , it too set_up retail wheeling . At first , the largest industrial customers could choose their power supplier , much as one picks a long-distance phone_service . By 1998 , every Briton will be able to do the same . The big winners so far ? Mid-sized commercial and industrial users , whose rates have dropped 30 % to 35 % . There ' s no reason to think rates will drop that much in California , but , Fessler said , &quot; a utility will behave in an economically rational mode. &quot; &quot; It will cater to the customers that are able to make alternative arrangements , and it will be far less sensitive to the needs and concerns of customers it regards_as captive , &quot; he said . Deconstructing Deregulation The California Public_Utilities Commission today will unveil proposed changes to the rules that govern the state ' s big investor-owned electric_power companies , including Southern California Edison . Here is a short history of regulatory trends in the utility industry . * The Traditional Electric Utility : In the 19th Century , utilities -- viewed_as &quot; natural monopolies &quot; -- were granted exclusive territorial franchises . The assumption was that big generating plants were the most efficient , and no one wanted overlapping power_lines from rival companies . The utility sold power at cost plus a regulated rate of return . * Wholesale Deregulation : A 1978 federal law allowed the first non-utility production of energy , in part to encourage the use of non-fossil fuels . A 1992 law opened the utilities ' transmission_lines to these independent producers . Low-cost natural_gas , efficient gas-fired turbines and cogeneration plants allow other companies to compete with utilities . Utilities must buy electricity from this new market of independent producers if it is cheaper than their own power . They still sell at cost plus a regulated return . * Retail Deregulation : Among the options under_consideration by the PUC is &quot; retail wheeling , &quot; which would allow big industrial customers -- and perhaps others , eventually -- to shop for power among various generators . The utility ' s only job would be transmitting the electricity . Proponents say this could apply market forces that would drastically cut electric rates . The utilities say price caps on their revenue would do the same thing without disrupting the utility system . Environmentalists say the lower power bills might come at the cost of environmental and social benefits .</TEXT>
