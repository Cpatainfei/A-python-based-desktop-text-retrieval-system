   <HEADLINE> SMOKING WHILE YOUNG TIED TO COLON_CANCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two studies involving more_than 150 # 000 people show that cigarette smoking can lead to colon_cancer and that smoking at a young age apparently fixes the risk for life , even if the smoking habit is dropped . &quot; With colon_cancer , if you smoke in your 20s , that risk stays with you , &quot; said Dr. Edward Giovannucci of Brigham and Women ' s Hospital in Boston , the Channing Laboratory and the Harvard School of Public Health. &quot; Even if you stop at age 40 , you ' ll still be at greater risk. &quot; The risk also is &quot; dose related , &quot; he said . &quot; The more you smoke , the more the risk. &quot; Other studies show that stopping cigarette smoking at any age , however , does lower the risk of heart_disease , lung_cancer and other disorders , Giovannucci said . The colon_cancer conclusions are based on a Harvard School of Public Health study of 47 # 935 men and a Brigham and Women ' s study of 118 # 334 women . Both studies used questionnaires to determine the smoking history of participants and then related that to the rate of colon-rectal cancer in the groups . The parallel studies are to be published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .</TEXT>
