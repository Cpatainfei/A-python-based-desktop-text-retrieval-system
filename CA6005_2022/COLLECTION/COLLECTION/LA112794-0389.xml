   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI : RECEIPTS ? CHECK ' EM , THEN TOSS ' EM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q : I have become a pack_rat about saving credit_card and ATM transaction receipts . Is there any reason to keep these slips if I find no discrepancies with my credit_card and bank_statements ? Is there a time_limit in which a credit_card or bank_statement can be disputed ? -- V.C . * A : If you do not find any discrepancies between your transaction receipts and your credit_card and bank_statements , there are few reasons to save these slips_of_paper . After all , can you think_of any reason the amounts would change after their first and only posting to your account ? Of course , you will want to save bank and credit_card statements after you have verified them , but the individual transaction receipts can be discarded as soon as you are satisfied that they have served their purpose . Taxpayers used to save credit_card slips to document the sales tax_deduction on income_tax_returns , but this deduction was long ago eliminated . You might want to save charge slips if you use your credit_card to make charitable contributions or other deductible payments -- for medical_expenses , child_care or miscellaneous business charges . But unless they are needed to verify a deduction , you really have no reason to hold_on to those receipts . Bankruptcy Rules on Pension_Funds Q : I am having severe financial difficulties and face foreclosure on my home and a potential bankruptcy filing . If we do end_up in bankruptcy , can our creditors and the Internal Revenue Service go_after my individual_retirement_account and other pension savings to satisfy our debts ? -- M.R.Q . * A : Your IRA , Keogh or other pension accounts cannot be touched by creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding . If you emerge from bankruptcy without satisfying tax obligations ( or making provisions to satisfy them in the future ) , the IRS could go_after your retirement accounts . Whether the IRS will actually seek to attach your pension assets to cover back taxes cannot be known with absolute precision . The agency is empowered to attach pension assets , but in practice it prefers to keep taxpayers from becoming impoverished in their old_age . Experts say you would be wise_to settle any debt to the government during the bankruptcy proceeding , either by paying all you owe or by making what is called an offer in compromise , in which you agree to pay a negotiated amount of the debt over time . Credit_Card Bills as Debt of Estate Q : My husband died leaving no estate from which to pay_off a_few thousand dollars in credit_card bills . The cards were in his own name ; I did not sign the applications . He was the only card user and paid on the accounts monthly from his own income . Am I liable for his outstanding debt ? -- J.R . * A : Your obligation depends_on whether the credit_card issuer knew your husband was married and whether the creditor depended_on your husband ' s community_property assets to cover the debts accumulated on the card . This is generally known as the &quot; intention of the creditor &quot; test . Here ' s how it would be applied in your case : Did your husband indicate on his credit_card application that he was married ? Most cards have such a question . If he marked &quot; yes , &quot; then the creditor can be said to have intended that the debts accumulated on the card would be the community_property of the husband and wife , making you obligated for the debts he left at death . The only exception would occur if your husband , while noting that he was married , indicated that the debts on the card were not community_property . Absent such a direct declaration , the debts are presumed_to be community_property . Principal Residence Replacement_Costs Q : My wife and I started construction of a home_in March . We expect it to be completed by the end of the year . We began paying_for the lot in 1991 . When we sell our present home and move_into this replacement residence , what portion of the costs will count toward purchase of a replacement residence ? What constitutes completion of construction of the replacement residence ? -- D.F . * A : Costs incurred within 24 months of the sale of the original residence -- that is , 24 months after and before -- count toward the cost of a replacement residence . For your entire construction costs to count , you must sell your present residence by March , 1996 . Any costs paid within 24 months before the sale will count as well -- but anything paid before that point will not count . Generally speaking , a certificate of occupancy should satisfy the IRS that the new home is your replacement residence . However , let ' s be clear that the IRS intends for you to be living_in the home as well . * Carla Lazzareschi cannot answer mail individually but will respond in this column to financial questions of general interest .
