   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : HE WHO DAZZLES KNOWS WHEN TO SHUT UP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Postscripts . . . Nothing on television is more visually stunning and poetic than figure skaters at the Winter_Olympics , any Winter_Olympics . On Tuesday , Verne Lundquist , the CBS announcer at Northern Lights Hall in Hamar , Norway , chose a single word -- the perfect one -- to define the performance of Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev , Russian silver medalists in the pairs competition . &quot; Dazzling. &quot; Equally so was Lundquist ' s silence during their program . He let the pictures , sounds and crowd response speak eloquently for themselves in the same way that Vin Scully always understands when to shut_up and not compete with an epic baseball moment . Less dazzling has been commentator Scott Hamilton ' s talkiness . His words often skate right over and draw attention from the athletes on the ice . He ' s smart and articulate , and naturally the former gold medalist knows his stuff . What he doesn ' t know is when to be_quiet . What CBS should do is have Hamilton keep his comments on live performances to a minimum and reserve his laurels and darts for the replays . Otherwise , it ' s like hearing play-by-play for &quot; Swan Lake. &quot; * Yet Hamilton is a mime compared with some non-Olympics sportscasters who dish_out hot-flaming oratory . One , in particular , comes irritatingly to mind . It ' s a bizarre sports commentator who can overshadow the event he ' s supposed to be describing . Dick Vitale -- the mouth from hell -- is a bizarre sports commentator , a grating , showboating former coach who ' s made his reputation by thrusting himself into the foreground of every college basketball event he ' s assigned to cover by ESPN and ABC . &quot; Colorful &quot; is the adjective frequently attached_to Vitale . Yes , the way a fingernail scraping a blackboard is colorful . Vitale obliterates a basketball telecast by talking non-stop and shouting it into oblivion , using his tongue to grind it to dust . You shutter when hearing Vitale relentlessly give details about Vitale , speak_for the umpteenth time about his &quot; diaper dandies &quot; ( a team ' s freshmen ) or again dip_into his bottomless bag of trivia . At the mention of shoes you may get his top five list of sneakers , followed by his top five sneaky fast point guards , followed by his top five power forwards with pointy heads . A player has baggy shorts ? Hear Vitale ' s top five short players . The man is merciless . And when he screams &quot; BABEEEEEE ! ! ! ! &quot; -- as in &quot; HEY , BABEEEEEE ! ! ! ! &quot; or &quot; MARK IT DOWN , BABEEEEEE ! ! ! ! &quot; -- his tubes are a thundering dunk that can shatter an entire backboard . Imagine the scenario if Vitale were rinkside at the Winter_Olympics , weighing in on the relatively genteel figure_skating competition that ' s been all but eclipsed by the frenzy over Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding &quot; sharing the same ice. &quot; You ' d think they were sharing the same shower . Of course , who needs Vitale to turn this into a carnival ? On Thursday , for example , &quot; CBS This Morning &quot; had its cameras on Kerrigan and Harding as they practiced with other skaters on the big rink at Hamar . To his credit , Hamilton cautioned co-hosts Harry Smith and Paula Zahn not to &quot; read too_much &quot; into any of this . Yet from his monitor at the alpine skiing venue at Kvitfjell , Smith reported breathlessly that Kerrigan and Harding &quot; skated right by each other. &quot; A bulletin ! And earlier , Zahn , from her post at a monitor in the snow at Lillehammer , reported that the two skaters &quot; did not establish eye contact. &quot; Not dazzling , babeeeeee ! ! ! ! Other Animals : KCET ' s admirable &quot; Life &amp; Times &quot; does more_than provide a studio for talking heads . Only recently , for example , it showed Jean Victor ' s scrupulously fair , yet sensitive , poignant and quietly impassioned film chronicling the futile efforts of Peter Wallerstein and his Whale Rescue Team to stop the capture of three dolphins off the coast of California . The dolphins were sought for an exhibit at the John D . Shedd Aquarium in Chicago . &quot; Battle for the Dolphins &quot; presented a classic clash between environmentalists and a marine mammal curator over whether these animals can thrive in captivity as they do_in the sea . Each side said it cared about the dolphins . The film artfully submerged you into the dolphins ' acoustic environment while conveying the &quot; excitement and curiosity &quot; that Wallerstein said he felt in their presence . But watching the capture , viewers could only speculate about the terror the dolphins must have felt upon being plucked from the water by Shedd employees and hauled aboard their boat . There was something deeply sad about their ultimate relocation in a tank . Save the dolphins -- and also talented independent filmmakers like Victor who labor on modest budgets to do superior work dealing with challenging topics . Infinitely bigger bucks were available to National Geographic and producers Dereck and Beverly Joubert to fund their recent PBS documentary , &quot; Reflections on Elephants. &quot; What remarkable footage of free-roaming African_elephants and their relationship to one another . One sequence showed huge adults actually going_down to their knees in a cooperative effort to free a calf from a mud hole . In another touching sight , an elephant used its trunk to hold the tusk of a dead elephant -- almost tenderly , like a treasured memento -- as if reluctant to part_with a comrade . When it comes_to especially intelligent animals , it ' s always tempting -- but a mistake -- to anthropomorphize . In watching &quot; Reflections of Elephants , &quot; though , you couldn ' t help marveling at these wondrous creatures and noting the qualities shared by their shrinking species and ours . While being repulsed , of course , by the thought of them being slaughtered for ivory .</TEXT>
