   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; THEY DON ' T LET FAX GET IN WAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tonya and Nancy are teammates . It is 1 o ' clock Sunday morning here and guess who ' s coming_to Norway ? Tonya Harding is coming . Nancy Kerrigan is already here and Harding is packing her suitcase and Michelle Kwan of Torrance is out . Michelle is 13 and presumably will have other chances to skate in the Olympics . But Harding is 23 and , for her , it is now or never . Turns_out to be now . It is 4 o ' clock Saturday afternoon in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and faxes are flying . Judge Patrick D . Gilroy in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Clackamas &quot; is pleased to announce that the issues now pending before this court have been resolved . . . . Tonya Harding will skate in the 1994 Olympics. &quot; Harding herself sends_word that she &quot; regrets any inconvenience &quot; and &quot; simply wants to skate in the Olympics and be treated fairly &quot; and sincerely hopes that she will &quot; not have to grant interviews , hold press_conferences or make additional public statements &quot; and would appreciate everyone ' s cooperation because &quot; it ' s time to put this matter behind all_of us. &quot; Dmitry Feld is passing_out the faxes . Dmitry is usually a spokesman for U.S. luge , not figure_skating , but he is here helping_out . Dmitry is trapped in a facsimile feeding frenzy , outstretched fingers reaching toward him , hungrily . Dmitry , a Russian immigrant , dispenses the faxes and says , &quot; Is this like a line for bread or what ? &quot; Mike Moran , spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee , reads aloud from his own USOC prepared statement , stapled to the faxes . It says , in part : &quot; Because of the resolution of the court proceedings in Oregon today , Tonya Harding will continue to be a member of the Olympic team , and she will compete in the ladies ' event in figure_skating beginning on Feb . 23. &quot; Half a day before , at high_noon , Moran was at the front of the same auditorium , riding verbal shotgun for Nancy Kerrigan at her first_appearance before the multitudinous world media . Now he has been called_back to announce and explain why a woman being investigated in a violent attack on Nancy Kerrigan is_on her way to Norway to skate with Kerrigan on behalf of the United States . Tonya and Nancy are teammates . &quot; We are appalled still by the attack on Nancy Kerrigan , which was not only an attack on the athlete , but an assault on the basic ideals of the Olympic movement and sportsmanship , &quot; Moran reads from the USOC prepared statement . &quot; The attack was designed to cripple her , alter the competition , and could have ended her career . We remain deeply concerned about this incident . &quot; From the beginning , the U.S. Olympic Committee has attempted to bring this matter_to a conclusion , and to employ our Constitution and Bylaws and other resources to find the truth in these matters and to be undeniably fair . &quot; For the moment , the_matter is stilled . . . . &quot; We wish each of them the best of success as they attempt to realize their lifelong Olympic Dreams. &quot; Dreams , with a capital D . It is the end of an imperfect day . From slightly past noon , at which time Nancy Kerrigan was saying that how she felt about Tonya Harding was between them , to slightly past midnight , at which time Harding was officially on her way here to Norway and hoping to deliver in_person that &quot; hug &quot; she wanted to give Kerrigan , this opening day of the XVII Winter_Olympics has been one of extraordinary pomp and circumstance . Within this time frame , to quote again from the USOC document , &quot; approximately 1 # 900 of the world ' s finest athletes &quot; -- neither Kerrigan nor Harding among them -- &quot; entered the Olympic Stadium in Lillehammer . The men and women of the 1994 U.S. Olympic team are now part of the Games and the reason why the United States delegation , the nation ' s First_Lady ( Hillary Rodham Clinton ) and countless other Americans are here in Norway. &quot; Tonya and Nancy are teammates . Each would appreciate no more questions . Alas , there are more questions than answers . Where will they practice ? At the same place , same session , as is currently stipulated ? One international skating official said late last week , coldly , if one cannot skate with the other , &quot; then don ' t bring her. &quot; What about Kerrigan ' s state_of_mind ? Her coach , Evy Scotvold , said with understandable concern , &quot; She can ' t get any peace. &quot; Yet she also looked her skater in the eye after practice and said , &quot; Get used to it . None of this is going_to go away. &quot; And what of Kerrigan ' s physical state ? She has lost_weight . She skated hard in practice to music by Tina Turner and Neil Diamond , took a fall , got_up , flexed her tender right knee . Saturday , she said she was fine . But she also skipped the opening ceremony , reluctant to put much strain on the leg . What will Harding say to Kerrigan , if anything ? How about that hug Tonya said she would give Nancy , given the chance ? How would Nancy respond to that ? &quot; Bye , &quot; Kerrigan said , and skated off . What if Harding had been told to hang her skates on an Oregon peg and watch the Olympics on TV ? One of her lawyers , Dennis Rawlinson , said , &quot; If she ' s later found innocent , we could never make_it up_to her. &quot; The U.S. is sending her . What else can it do ? Norway is welcoming her . What else can it do ? It ' s a mystery , as Kerrigan called it herself . Neither woman has a clue how it will turn_out . A soap_opera , others would call it . It has villains and victims and lovers and lawyers and sponsors and music . In the background is a 13-year-old girl from the fringe of Los Angeles who acts more mature than most of the grown-ups . Michelle Kwan has been prepared to skate for herself and her country . Now she will stand_by and watch , with other Americans by the millions . She is the most innocent_of bystanders . Bravo , Michelle . She will never show any more grace or poise in her career than she is showing right now . Now that Tonya and Nancy are teammates . Olympic Dreams still alive . Dreams . Plural .</TEXT>
