   <HEADLINE> IRVINE ' S RAINBOW HOLDING THE KEY TO SAFE DRIVING ON INFO HIGHWAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years the fear of software piracy has brought the giants of technology to the door of Rainbow Technologies Inc. , which protects programs with matchbook-size devices that plug into the backs of personal_computers . Buyers such_as Microsoft Corp. , Borland International and Hewlett-Packard Co . include the keys with software programs that they sell , particularly those marketed in foreign countries where intellectual property standards are lower or are not enforced . Software codes can be written so they will not run unless one of Rainbow ' s keys is plugged into a computer ' s printer port . &quot; We ' re an insurance_company , &quot; said Walter Straub , Rainbow ' s chief_executive_officer . &quot; Customers will continue to buy insurance as long as they see a threat. &quot; Now Rainbow , based in Irvine , is positioning itself as an arms merchant in the next data war : the fight over how much protection there should be for information transmitted between computers . In October , Rainbow signed a letter_of_intent to buy Mykotronx Inc. , a privately held Torrance company that makes a controversial microprocessor known as the clipper chip . * Adopted as a procurement standard by the U.S. Department_of_Commerce earlier this year , the chip will allow police agencies to decode scrambled electronic_signals to eavesdrop on digital_communications sent by modems , fax machines and other telephone links . The decoding would be conducted under the same principle as legally authorized wiretaps of ordinary telephone_conversations . On the surface , acquiring Mykotronx would appear to be an excellent move for Rainbow . With on-line data transmission replacing many of the distribution functions that were once done_by floppy_disk , publicly traded Rainbow could position itself as an industry leader and respected voice in national debates about encryption standards and on-line privacy issues . But Wall_Street has not been kind recently to Rainbow ' s stock , driving it down in recent weeks from about $ 16 a share after the Mykotronx proposal was announced to a close of $ 12.25 in Wednesday ' s NASDAQ trading . Analysts say that the 23 % decline probably has to do with uncertainty about if and when the deal will close . &quot; It ' s people discounting the acquisition as the days go_by until it ' s finally announced , &quot; said Steve DeLuca , an analyst at investment bank Cruttenden &amp; Co . in Irvine . DeLuca and other analysts are generally positive about a Rainbow-Mykotronx combination , which would broaden Rainbow ' s revenue base . Though Rainbow also sells procedures to protect data on CD-ROMs , about 95 % of its revenue comes from sale of its protection keys , Straub said . The company reported 1993 revenue of $ 35 million , while Mykotronx had revenue of about $ 9 million . John J . Girton , an analyst at the San Francisco brokerage Van Kasper &amp; Co. , said Rainbow ' s recent stock slide may reflect some investors ' doubts about whether Mykotronx ' s chip technology can be commercialized at competitive prices . Rainbow is in a good position overall , however , said Girton , whose company co-managed a Rainbow stock offering in 1991 . &quot; There ' s been some concern about whether the deal is going_to go_through , but we think it ' s a long-term buy , &quot; he said of Rainbow ' s stock . &quot; From our perspective , it doesn ' t matter if the deal goes_through or not , since the stock ' s trading at what it was before. &quot; * Although the clipper chip standard is voluntary , privacy advocates assert that government_agencies are using it to pressure commercial suppliers of telephones and computer modems to implant the device in consumer goods as well as those sold to public agencies . Whatever the fate of clipper , Mykotronx , as the sole supplier of the chip and other related encryption technologies , is_well positioned to benefit as norms are established for the coding and decoding of data . The company now has contracts with the National Security Agency , including an agreement to supply equipment for spy_satellites . Mykotronx President Ted Bettwy said this week that , if Rainbow follows_through with the purchase , it will pay between $ 20 million and $ 25 million for the company . Straub and other Rainbow executives said they would not comment until the deal is closed . That could happen as soon as later this month or early January , Bettwy said . Rainbow was founded in 1984 by Straub and others , and initially produced upgrade products for dot-matrix printers . The idea for software protection keys resulted from a collaboration with California Software_Products Inc. , a Santa Ana company seeking a way to safeguard a $ 3 # 500 software program it was selling that allowed small computers to mimic the functions of much larger machines . In addition to its Irvine headquarters , which has about 40 engineers among its 100 employees , Rainbow has manufacturing facilities in northern Thailand and in France , where it bought competitor Microphar SA in 1992 . Worldwide , the company has about 160 employees . California Software_Products still buys about 8 # 000 protection devices from Rainbow each year , said Elizabeth Richell , a vice_president of marketing there . &quot; It ' s not something you ' d want to put_out unprotected , &quot; Richell said of her company ' s software . &quot; We ' ve stayed with them , &quot; she said of Rainbow , &quot; because their products are reliable . We ' ve got systems in some very obscure , hard-to-reach places , so it ' s important that we can depend_on their products. &quot; Companies such_as California Software that sell overseas often find that other countries do not have the intellectual property protections they have come_to rely_on in the United States . Trade groups representing the major software companies estimate between $ 7 billion to $ 12 billion in sales are lost worldwide each year to software piracy . That is a main reason for the inclusion of intellectual property protection agreements in many multinational trade pacts , including the massive Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , or GATT treaty , scheduled for a vote today in the Senate . Companies that buy Rainbow ' s keys generally include them with software_packages costing $ 250 for_sale overseas and $ 500 or more in the United States , said Michael Emerson , the company ' s marketing manager . Demand for data protection will only increase , Straub said , as electronic distribution becomes more popular . Rainbow Vision With its intention to buy Mykotronx Inc. , Irvine ' s Rainbow Technologies makes a bid for a central position in the future of data transmission . A look_at the company : Rainbow Technologies at a Glance * President and CEO : Walter Straub * Products : About 95 % of Rainbow ' s revenue come from sales of computer_hardware to protect software against piracy . * Other offices : Charlotte , N.C. ; Paris ; London ; Munich , Germany , and Calgary , Canada * Employees : 160 worldwide , including about 100 at Irvine headquarters , 25 in Munich and 14 in London Stock Tumble Rainbow ' s stock declined most of the year , then rallied in October , but ended November well below its January level .
