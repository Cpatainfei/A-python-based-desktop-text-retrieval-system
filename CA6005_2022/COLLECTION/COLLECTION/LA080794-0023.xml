   <HEADLINE> A LEADERSHIP STUDY WITHOUT FOLLOWERS ; CERTAIN TRUMPETS : THE CALL OF LEADERS , BY GARRY WILLS ( SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER : $ 23 ; 304 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the post-Cold War era , when old certainties have fled and ideologies and governments have crumbled -- and global economic forces undermine the stability of daily life -- there seems to be a hunger for leadership . Although often cynical about leaders , especially politicians , many Americans appear to want strong men and women to provide a way forward in confused and troubling times . Witness the appeal of independent presidential candidate Ross Perot , the rise of the Christian Right or new Black Nationalist leaders . But don ' t we already have plenty of leaders ? After all , societies have individuals who occupy the top spots in government , in business_enterprises , in social_organizations or in hereditary bodies like a kingdom or a tribe -- but does simply being in a position of authority make a person a leader ? People expect a leader to lead , not simply enjoy the perks of high office and the trappings of power . This is especially true in times of change . In democratic societies and in most post-industrial organizations , except perhaps the military , a leader cannot simply issue orders and expect to be obeyed . A leader must persuade as well as command . What , then , is leadership ? Are there different kinds ? Where do leaders come from ? Are they born -- &quot; a natural leader &quot; -- or forged by circumstance -- or &quot; in the right place at the right time ? &quot; Can we identify leadership traits that one might cultivate or learn ? And , has modern technology , especially television , transformed telegenic celebrities into leaders and pushed_aside others ? These are some of the questions that come_to_mind when considering a book about leaders by the distinguished scholar Gary Wills , professor of Humanities at Northwestern University , who has previously written insightful books on such American political_leaders as Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan , Jack_Kennedy , George_Washington and Abraham_Lincoln . In his introduction , Wills makes the important , if obvious point , that a leader needs followers and is defined , in part , by them . Wills offers this definition : &quot; The leader is one who mobilizes others toward a goal shared by leader and followers . . . . Leaders , followers , and goals make_up the three necessary supports for leadership. &quot; Wills goes_on to say that a &quot; leader whose qualities do not match those of potential followers is simply irrelevant. &quot; Wills considers real leadership to involve an interactive relationship between leaders and followers , not simply the issue of orders . &quot; Leadership is always a struggle , &quot; he writes , implying that it isn ' t easy , and that real leaders are rare and that strong , active leadership is hard to find . Wills then proceeds to examine leadership by presenting 16 types of leaders through mini-profiles , ranging from elected to military charismatic to saintly , and including sports , business and church . In each category , Wills presents an ideal-type and an anti-type -- the latter a noted person who failed as a leader . As in any typology , Wills ' categories are arbitrary . Not surprisingly , Wills finds that President Franklin_Roosevelt was a successful leader , and the anti-type Adlai Stevenson was a failure . But too simplistically , Wills attributes the difference to the fact that FDR had to triumph over personal adversity -- his polio -- which made him a stronger person with more empathy for followers , while Stevenson coasted through life without having to overcome such a challenge . Wills discounts the role of history and circumstance -- namely , that FDR came_to power in the Depression when many grass-roots social movements were demanding action from the federal_government , while Stevenson practiced politics in the more conservative ' 50s and never won national power . One can always disagree about lists -- who should be included and who shouldn ' t -- especially about important people -- and one can disagree about categories . The problem that I have with Wills ' book is that both his list of leaders and his typology seem both too broad brushed and rigid to be either very interesting or very informative . A book that includes profiles of such diverse and historically disparate people as King David , Ross Perot , Madonna and Carl Stotz ( the founder of Little_League ) runs the risk of trivializing leadership -- or at the very least , of making_it less complicated than it is . The historical circumstances under which individuals become leaders is short-changed -- and the further back Wills goes_in time , the less relevant is his work to the present day . I did not find his discussion of charismatic leaders utilizing King David and Solomon as his examples very enlightening . I would have preferred that Wills use his skills of critical_analysis to present Jesse Jackson or Louis Farrakhan or Pat Robertson and an examination of how they interacted with their followers . Some of his examples are inappropriate , if not incorrect . In discussing diplomatic leadership , Wills uses Andrew Young as his type and discusses his role in the Civil Rights movement as Dr. King ' s negotiator . Young was really more of a staffer who carried_out King ' s many-pronged strategy than a diplomatic leader in his own_right . Even as U.N. ambassador , Young was not a major diplomatic leader , not did he ever really have his own following . George Kennan , Dean Acheson or Henry Kissinger , to name a_few , would have been more appropriate choices . Wills treats Martin_Luther_King Jr . as an archetype rhetorical leader , which badly understates King ' s political achievements . In order to fit King into one of the narrow boxes of his typology , Wills misses much of importance . King was one of the greatest political_leaders of a mass citizens ' movement in U.S. history -- and a critical_analysis of his leadership would be_well worth reading , but what Wills provides is narrow and disappointing . Of course , it isn ' t entirely fair to take an author to task for having written a different book from what one would like to read -- but as a fan of Gary Wills , I wish that he had focused_on fewer leaders and selected ones who have risen to leadership in the media age -- people like Vaclav Havel , Lech Walesa , Gorbachev , Yeltsin , Nixon , Reagan , Cesar Chavez , Saul Alinksy , Ralph Nader , Betty Freidan and Mother Teresa -- to name a_few -- and analyzed the sources and means of their leadership , as well as their social and political context and , in particular , how they provided goals and vision to followers and led movements or organizations . For readers seeking a scholarly book on leadership , James MacGregor Burns ' Pulitzer Prize_winner , &quot; Leadership , &quot; is still the classic . For profiles of modern leaders in a variety of fields , I recommend &quot; Makers of the Modern_World &quot; by Louis Untermeyer . These two books together cover the ground trod by Wills , and do_it more coherently and in greater depth than &quot; Certain Trumpets. &quot; What is still needed is a book on leadership in the post-industrial , high tech , media-driven era we live_in . Unfortunately , Wills did not provide such a book .</TEXT>
