   <HEADLINE> FAMALARO GIVEN WEEK TO WEIGH EXTRADITION FIGHT ; COURTS : ARIZONA ATTORNEY REPRESENTING MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING DENISE HUBER SAYS HE NEEDS MORE TIME TO REVIEW DOCUMENTS . LOCAL PUBLIC_DEFENDER DOES NOT EXPECT HIS CLIENT TO CONTEST PROCEEDING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Murder_suspect John J . Famalaro was granted a week ' s reprieve Monday to decide whether to fight his extradition to Orange County on charges of killing Denise Huber and keeping her body in a freezer . Appearing in Yavapai County Superior_Court on a governors ' warrant , Famalaro sat quietly , staring straight ahead during a brief court hearing in which Judge Raymond W . Weaver Jr . gave the defense until 5 p.m. Aug . 29 to file documents contesting extradition . Defense_attorney Thomas K . Kelly , who is representing Famalaro in Arizona matters , said outside of court that he needs more time to review the extradition documents signed by Govs . Pete Wilson and Fife Symington and filed_in court here Monday . &quot; If we feel there are some legal issues there , we could contest the validity of the complaint or the extradition warrant , &quot; Kelly said . Deputy Public_Defender Leonard Gumlia , who is representing Famalaro in Orange County , said it has been beneficial to keep Famalaro in Arizona to assist members of the defense_team digging into Famalaro ' s background locally and to give the defense more time to prepare_for the case . Still , Gumlia said , he expects Famalaro to waive extradition next Monday . &quot; Assuming ( the extradition paperwork ) is all_in order , John Famalaro will waive on the 29th , &quot; Gumlia said , adding that Monday ' s hearing &quot; is not a statement that extradition is going_to be fought. &quot; Famalaro ' s anticipated waiver of extradition would be a token gesture of cooperation . Experts say extradition is inevitable unless a defendant can prove that he is not the suspect being sought or that law_enforcement has erred in considering him a suspect . Famalaro faces the death_penalty if convicted of kidnaping and murdering Huber , a 23-year-old Newport Beach waitress who vanished in June , 1991 , after a tire blew_out on her car on the Corona del Mar Freeway as she was driving_home from a rock_concert . Arizona law_enforcement officials last month found Huber ' s nude , handcuffed body in a running freezer stowed inside a stolen rental truck that was parked in Famalaro ' s driveway . Huber ' s belongings were found in Famalaro ' s garage in a box marked &quot; Christmas. &quot; Medical tests are pending to determine whether Huber was sexually assaulted . Jurisdiction in the case shifted from Yavapai County to Orange County after law_enforcement authorities discovered traces of Huber ' s blood in a Laguna Hills warehouse rented by Famalaro . Authorities allege that Huber was abducted or lured from the side of the road and killed in the warehouse . If Famalaro waives extradition , as expected , he must be transported to Orange County within 10 days , said Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Department spokeswoman Laurie Berra . Kelly said if he decided to waive extradition , Famalaro could be taken from Arizona as early as Monday evening . Orange County Assistant Dist . Atty . John Conley said Monday that authorities have not yet decided who will go_to Arizona to pick_up the suspect or whether Famalaro will be brought_back to Orange County &quot; by air , land or by sea. &quot; &quot; We ' re waiting until ( extradition ) actually happens , &quot; Conley said . &quot; Until it goes_down , you don ' t react. &quot; Famalaro , 37 , has been a model prisoner during his monthlong incarceration at the Yavapai County Jail , authorities said . In other developments Monday , Weaver agreed to dismiss a theft charge against Famalaro stemming from the stolen rental truck . The dismissal , which could be refiled if necessary , will smooth the way for extradition on the more serious charges , said Yavapai County Counsel Thomas B . Lindberg . &quot; All it means is the defense is trying to buy a little more time , &quot; Lindberg said of the extradition issue . When told of Lindberg ' s remarks , Kelly said the prosecutor was very &quot; perceptive &quot; but declined further comment on the_matter . Famalaro appeared healthy during the hearing and did not shy_away_from the media cameras . As on prior occasions , he wore an orange jail uniform as he shuffled into the courtroom , his ankles shackled and his wrists handcuffed and bound to his waist . Kelly said his client is doing as well as can be expected , but he is concerned about his family . Famalaro has had several visits with his parents and sister , but noted that Famalaro ' s father , who has Parkinson ' s disease , was recently hospitalized . Famalaro lived next door to his parents and was their primary caretaker until his arrest.HUBER , DENISE ANETTE</TEXT>
