   <HEADLINE> MCA TO BUILD THEME PARK IN JAPAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Entertainment giant MCA Inc. , which operates Universal Studios theme parks in Los Angeles and Orlando , Fla. , on Wednesday announced plans to build a $ 1.5-billion park in Osaka , Japan . When completed in 1999 , the 140-acre Universal Studios Japan is expected to rival Tokyo Disneyland in size , with a target of 8 million visitors in its first year of operation , Osaka city officials said . While Walt Disney Co. ' s Euro Disney theme park in France is facing severe difficulties , the Tokyo park has been immensely successful since opening in 1983 . Construction of the MCA park will be the most dramatic venture to result from the 1990 purchase of Los Angeles-based MCA by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co . for $ 6.6 billion , the largest purchase ever of an American company by a foreign firm . Matsushita , the world ' s largest consumer electronics maker , is based in Osaka . One question emerging is why MCA would build the park now , given Japan ' s weakened economy . Frank Stanek , president of MCA Enterprises International , said the company believes that Japan ' s economy will recover before the park opens in five years . &quot; These are long-term projects . Recessions don ' t last forever no matter where we are , &quot; said Stanek , who is overseeing the project . He added that recessions often are a good time to build a major project because construction costs are usually lower . Universal Studios Japan will be the first Universal Studios theme park built outside the United States . Like its U.S. counterparts , the theme park will feature replications of sets from famous Universal Pictures films such_as &quot; Jaws , &quot; &quot; E.T. &quot; and &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; -- movies that have been very popular_with Japanese audiences . In addition to the theme park , the development is expected to include film and television production facilities . MCA and its partners are also considering building shopping , dining and entertainment areas and hotels on nearby land . Key issues , including the percentage of ownership between the city of Osaka and MCA , remain to be resolved . Rank Organisation , a partner in Universal Studios Florida , may also participate in the project , according to MCA . But Osaka Mayor Masaya Nishio and other officials expressed confidence that the park -- essentially a replica of the Universal Studios park in Florida -- will be built . In a statement , MCA President Sidney J . Sheinberg suggested that finding the right location had not been easy . He added that MCA believes the project will be aided by its waterfront location , access to transportation and nearby redevelopment . The park is to be built_on Osaka Bay , with construction set to begin in 1996 . Vacationers from South_Korea , Taiwan and Hong Kong , in addition to Japanese visitors , will have relatively easy access to the park site . Osaka is located 245 miles west of Tokyo , about a three-hour ride by bullet train . Prospects for the success of the project should be boosted by the impending completion of the new Kansai International Airport in Osaka , due_to open in September . Kansai International , Japan ' s first 24-hour airport , is expected to become a major new transportation hub for East Asia . Osaka Mayor Nishio said that within this year , the city government , local industrial firms and MCA will form a new joint corporation called Universal Studios Japan to carry_out the park project . In an interview , MCA ' s Stanek downplayed Matsushita ' s influence on the decision to launch the park . He said that MCA has been exploring the development of a theme park in Japan since 1980 -- well before Matsushita acquired the company . Holley reported from Tokyo and Bates from Los Angeles .</TEXT>
