   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ; COMMENTARY ON CHILD_CARE ; TAX_CREDIT WOULD REMOVE FINANCIAL IMPEDIMENT TO ADOPTION ; SENATE BILL WOULD HELP PARENTS SURMOUNT HIGH INITIAL COSTS , BENEFITING CHILDREN IN NEED OF PERMANENT FAMILIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Individuals of sturdy character are the building_blocks of a civilized society , and a stable , loving family is the crucible in which they are forged . From birth , children are imbued with their family ' s values and world_view ; from their parents they learn to acquire virtues and avoid vices . It should come as no surprise , then , that the national social degeneration and moral decline of the last three decades has coincided with the accelerating collapse of the traditional two-parent family . Growing_up in a two-parent family gives children a far better chance at success in school , career , marriage and parenthood ; it is also an advantage unavailable to many thousands of children in our state who lack families . Adoption is a truly compassionate vehicle for extending that advantage to unwanted or needy children . Unfortunately , the costs of private adoptions are prohibitive for many prospective parents . Independent adoptions ( directly between families ) typically cost $ 8 # 000 to $ 10 # 000 , while private agency adoptions can cost from $ 10 # 000 to $ 30 # 000 . Despite this financial impediment , many couples choose to shoulder it in_order to adopt . Contrary to the general myth , most adoptive families are not wealthy but , in fact , are working-class . While they can handle the day-to-day costs of absorbing another child , surmounting the high initial costs can prove impossible . Were adoption a less expensive endeavor , it stands to reason that even more couples might consider it . Statistics from the California Department of Social_Services reinforce this . Sixty-one percent of all parents who put children up for independent adoption are single parents , usually mothers . They are typically young ( average age 22 ) and low-income and have a high_school education at best . Another 10 % are young birth parents with the same profile who are separating and have decided to give_up their child for adoption . The profile of these parents correlates significantly with the profile of many receiving public assistance , such_as Aid to Families With Dependent Children ( AFDC ) . It is logical to assume that many of these adoptions are removing children from welfare families and placing them into financially stable families . Not only are the sizes of AFDC grants cut_back with these removals , but the children are far more likely to become productive citizens and less likely to enter into intergenerational welfare dependence . With regard_to foster_children , reasons for adopting them into families are manifold and compelling . There are approximately 10 # 000 children in foster care with adoption as the goal ; the average state payment per foster_child is $ 1 # 096.30 a month , or $ 13 # 155.60 a year . Taxpayers would save millions by adopting them into loving , stable families . Adoption is also in the best interest of children in foster care . &quot; The odds of moving easily into independence are stacked against foster_children , &quot; according to Richard P . Barth , a UC Berkeley professor and recognized expert on the subject . The need for a stable family environment is especially acute during the adolescent years . A 1983 study found that males in foster care had &quot; strikingly more academic and social problems than a comparison group of non-foster youth. &quot; A recent survey of the homeless in Alameda County found that one-third of them had lived_in foster_homes ; similar studies of the homeless in New York and Los Angeles revealed that 30 % to 40 % had been in foster care . &quot; The conclusions are clear that foster care is a primary source of the homeless and that they remain homeless for a long_time , &quot; Barth said . It must be said that we are all grateful to the many selfless and hard-working foster_parents who do their best to love the children in their care and provide them with stable surroundings . Clearly , though , the best foster care is still no substitute for the bonding and sense of belonging that comes_with membership in a family . Foster care is temporary ; family is forever . What can be done ? For starters , financial barriers to adoption should be lowered . In that spirit , I have introduced Senate Bill 1920 , which would establish a one-time , per-child tax_credit to help adoptive parents . The credit would be equal_to 50 % of the cost of the adoption of an American citizen , to a maximum of $ 2 # 500 . Making adoption a more affordable , and thus feasible , option is not only morally good but socially practical . Interestingly , this obvious notion was acted_on far more thoroughly and effectively a century ago . In his exceptional book &quot; The Tragedy of American Compassion , &quot; Marvin Olasky points_out the enlightened attitude toward foster_children evident in 1890 . &quot; Compare treatment now -- shuttling from foster_home to foster_home , or growing_up in a home without a daddy -- to treatment then , when adoption into a two-parent home was a priority preached about in churches and facilitated by a lack of bureaucracy , &quot; Olasky wrote . &quot; Then , the New York Children ' s Aid Society alone found permanent homes for 70 # 000 , and Jacob Riis ( a contemporary liberal reformer and poverty fighter ) wrote , ' The records show that the great mass , with this start given them , become useful citizens. ' &quot; Another contemporary social activist , Charles Brace , wrote_of children who grow_up lacking parental love and guidance : &quot; The faculties of the individual are mainly bent_on securing support by means other_than industry . Cunning , deception , flattery and waiting for chances become the means of livelihood . Self-respect is lost , and with it go the best qualities of the soul. &quot; Clearly , this very reasonable tax_credit is a bargain for all concerned . Although the state_government will forgo an estimated $ 7 million , that is a pittance in comparison to direct taxpayer savings when a foster_child is adopted . After all , a onetime credit of $ 2 # 500 is cheaper than a $ 13 # 000 annual foster_child subsidy . Unfortunately , the myopic , bureaucratic bean-counters cranking the wheels of government are unable to grasp this simple concept . Thus , the seat-warmers at the state_Department of Finance peek from under their green eyeshades and fret about &quot; lost &quot; revenue , and the Senate Appropriations Committee ill-advisedly bought their argument and restricted the credit to county adoptions . Still , it is a beginning . Passage of SB 1920 will place on the books a policy tool to strengthen families that can be expanded in the years ahead . There are thousands of children in California eligible for adoption . Common_sense and hard experience dictate that these children be placed into stable , loving , permanent families , lest they fall_into social pathologies and wind_up hurting themselves and others and costing taxpayers millions in welfare and criminal expenditures . The simple step of lowering the economic barriers to adoption -- enactment of SB 1920 -- is a step toward avoiding that situation .</TEXT>
