   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; CAMPUS SMOKING BAN MAY BE EXPANDED ; HEALTH : PRACTICE IS ALREADY BANNED IN OFFICES AND CLASSROOMS , BUT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS TRUSTEES GIVE INITIAL OK TO STRICTER REQUIREMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ban on smoking at the College of the Canyons may be expanded to include the outdoor_sports stadium , uncovered stairwells and a 20-foot area surrounding campus doorways . Smoking is already banned in offices and classrooms , but college trustees Wednesday gave initial approval to the stricter requirements . &quot; Basically , what we ' ve done is taken smoking out of classrooms and out of hallways and put it outside , &quot; Trustee Bruce Fortine said . The proposed ban also applies to formal campus events held outside , such_as a recent cultural arts festival or the weekly farmers ' market . The ban will come_up for a final vote April 20 . If approved , it would take_effect immediately , according to college public information officer Sue Bozman . &quot; That doesn ' t mean you can ' t smoke in the parking_lot , &quot; Bozman said . College officials have been discussing smoking prohibitions since November . &quot; From the college standpoint , we ' re concerned with the health issue , &quot; Fortine said . &quot; There was a feeling by the board that a ( complete ) no-smoking policy would be too restrictive. &quot; Smoking has been prohibited for more_than six months at all indoor and outdoor facilities and events involving Santa Clarita ' s public high_schools and junior_high_schools . Trustees at the William S . Hart Union High_School District expanded their restrictions to outdoor events in August to qualify for $ 30 # 000 a year in federal Tobacco Use and Prevention Education funds . Meanwhile , the city has been considering a smoking ban that would prohibit smoking in restaurants , workplaces and enclosed public areas . Commercial businesses such_as banks , malls , theaters and Laundromats are also covered . The City_Council approved the ordinance in December , but changed direction a month later when nearly 200 people packed City_Hall . Restaurant owners said their customers would be driven into nearby unincorporated areas where no ban exists . Two more public hearings will be held to discuss Santa Clarita ' s tobacco control ordinance before it is voted upon . Those meetings have been delayed by the Jan . 17 earthquake and its battering of City_Hall .</TEXT>
