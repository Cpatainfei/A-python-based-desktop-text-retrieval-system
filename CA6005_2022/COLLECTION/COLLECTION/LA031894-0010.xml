   <TEXT> * Like a phoenix rising from the ashes of a failed political career , Dick Nixon reappears on the world stage . President Boris Yeltsin publicly snubbed Nixon for &quot; protocol indiscretions &quot; for meeting with opposition political_leaders before meeting with him.Yeltsin was livid in his refusal to meet with Nixon . He abruptly canceled Nixon ' s briefings with lower government officials and removed the complimentary bodyguard and limousine service . Yeltsin ' s public reaction puzzled me , knowing the tremendous financial help needed from America , until I read an article in The Times , March 10 . The last paragraph illuminates why I believe Yeltsin spoke_of Nixon ' s misstep so angrily . It states , &quot; On a visit to Russia in April , 1991 , Nixon met Yeltsin against Gorbachev ' s wishes ; Nixon later urged Washington to forge better ties with Gorbachev ' s rivals. &quot; Does Nixon ' s arrival and talks with opposition leaders now look_like deja_vu to Yeltsin ? Who is Nixon working for now that he ' s retired from &quot; public &quot; life ? He says he traveled_to Russia as a private citizen doing some fact-finding , not official business . Nixon said he talked to President Clinton before traveling_to Russia . Is Nixon the &quot; kingmaker &quot; or just a messenger for those with &quot; real &quot; power in the world ? As I see things , Nixon isn ' t helping the situation and may jeopardize future relations between Russia and the United States . I don ' t believe Nixon is a &quot; fact-finding &quot; asset America needs at this time . It ' s time to say good_night , Dick . DENNIS E . HAMRICK Placentia * Looks_like the Russians won ' t have Richard Nixon to kick_around anymore . RON SALMONS Pacific Palisades</TEXT>
