   <HEADLINE> SIMI PARENTS GROUP BATTLES DISTRICT OVER SEX EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About a dozen conservative Simi Valley parents , frustrated by their school_board ' s stance on birth_control education , formed a grass-roots group last winter to fight the inclusion of such information in sex education classes . Now that fledgling group , known as Citizens for Truth in Education -- or CTE -- has grown_into a highly vocal organization that boasts a mailing_list of more_than 800 people , members say . The group ' s emergence has led critics and supporters to a common conclusion : CTE has the ear of Simi Valley school leaders and is defining itself as an education watchdog . As the new year approaches , organizers of the group are moving full steam ahead with their own agenda , which some people believe should be closely monitored . &quot; I think any time they get the ear of somebody -- and they have the ear of the board -- you have to realize they are a force to be reckoned with , &quot; said Paige Moser , coordinator of the local chapter of the National Organization for Women . In just one year , the group has tried to thwart the Simi Valley Unified School District board ' s attempts to approve a new birth_control curriculum and fought to defeat the California Learning Assessment System exam . Two founding members -- Walt Madrid and Glenn Woodbury -- ran_for school_board seats in the November election . Both lost , but not without garnering support from like-minded voters who embraced their views on sex education , uniforms and school safety . &quot; I think the school_board is more cautious now that there is a group of concerned parents watching them carefully , &quot; said Matt Noah , a former U . S . Senate candidate who ran under the Christian Pro-Life Party and is a founding member of Citizens for Truth in Education . Noah has since split from the group . &quot; I think that they are a force in the community , &quot; he said . But organizers say that was not their intent . They simply want to express the concerns of parents and have elected officials listen . &quot; We are truly seeking truth . We are trying to figure_out what is best for our kids to be taught , &quot; CTE Chairwoman Coleen Ary said . One of the group ' s goals is to research and investigate educational issues , which are detailed in a monthly four-page newsletter . Members consistently attend school_board meetings and usually address the board on one or more topics . They have pushed for a sex education curriculum that teaches only abstinence and a return to rigorous academic standards . Novel teaching_methods that promote critical thinking are &quot; feel-good mumbo-jumbo &quot; that does not belong in the classroom , they say . The group ' s strong advocacy of abstinence-only birth_control education has attracted the attention of People for the American Way , a self-appointed watchdog of the Christian right . &quot; We know of CTE , &quot; said Jean M . Hessburg , state director of People for the American Way . &quot; Their views and positions are certainly aligned with the views and positions that national religious right groups hold. &quot; While some conservative activists in Simi Valley balk at such terms , Ary said sometimes her group does line_up behind positions held by religious right organizations . &quot; I would say that some of that would be true , &quot; she said . &quot; It is certainly true with sex education and the CLAS test . That might not be true of school prayer or creationism . It depends_on what the issue is. &quot; The first and most controversial issue Citizens for Truth in Education tackled was sex education . The issue erupted in April , 1993 , when a school trustee questioned the absence of pregnancy prevention information during a review of the district ' s curriculum . &quot; At that time , Debbie Sandland said , ' Where in this curriculum do we teach kids about birth_control ? ' And the fact of the_matter was , we were not , &quot; said Leslie Crunelle , director of secondary_education for the school district . Sex education is not required in California . But if school districts elect to include it in their curricula , state educators recommend teaching students how to protect themselves against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases , state_Department of Education officials said . At the school_board ' s direction , a committee made_up of school officials , parents and students was formed to develop guidelines for a revised sex education or &quot; family life &quot; curriculum . The committee recommended that seventh-graders learn about some methods of pregnancy prevention , such_as birth_control_pills and condoms , and that 10th-grade students learn all methods of birth_control . The committee also suggested expanding lessons on abstinence and refusal skills . But the committee ' s recommendations triggered a volatile debate in Simi Valley . CTE members cited studies saying that providing birth_control information increases teen-age sexual_activity , while students asserted that the information was vital in protecting teen-agers against disease and pregnancy . In February , the school_board approved the recommendations and , four months later , a committee of teachers and nurses set_out to find materials that would meet those guidelines . But so far , the committee has been unable to get those materials approved . A proposed curriculum was presented in October , but some trustees found portions of the materials inappropriate , school officials said . Although the materials were never formally presented for board approval , members of CTE reviewed the texts and assailed trustees for letting teachers and nurses stray from the guidelines , they said . At an Oct . 18 board_meeting , parent Kathy Burke singled_out sections in the proposed curriculum that mentioned homosexuality , masturbation and oral_sex , and scolded the trustees for allowing such information to be included . &quot; We never discussed alternative lifestyles , &quot; Glenn Woodbury told the board that night . &quot; I don ' t want my boy being taught this. &quot; Calling the materials a &quot; travesty , &quot; Ary told trustees : &quot; Children will be left to their own designs to determine right and wrong for themselves. &quot; Trustees received new materials before Christmas break this month , and said they planned to thoroughly scour the revised texts . Once the materials are presented to the public , CTE members said they plan to scour them too . &quot; They created one huge mess when they created these recommendations , &quot; Ary said . &quot; With sex education , we make no bones about it . . . . The choice that they should make is abstinence. &quot; That position disturbs some board_members and community activists . &quot; As educators , I feel we need to come_in with non-biased information about birth_control , &quot; Trustee Carla Kurachi said . &quot; State the facts , state the risks , state the side_effects -- that ' s it . . . . I don ' t think telling students what choices they should make is going_to be effective. &quot; Some critics say CTE ' s efforts are a threat to education , which could hinder attempts at educational reform . &quot; I don ' t like what they stand_for , which is a fear of knowledge , &quot; NOW ' s Moser said . &quot; Across the nation , we are seeing people either out of ignorance or out of fear embracing reactionary concepts. &quot; The group ' s rigid stance on such issues as sex education alienates some people , Kurachi said , which could keep CTE from establishing a significant toehold in the community . &quot; They are a watchdog for their own issues , &quot; Kurachi said . &quot; If they are not willing to reach a middle ground , if it has to be an all or nothing , then they are going_to lose the ear of the board. &quot; But until parents are satisfied that school officials are responding to their concerns , Ary said , Citizens for Truth in Education will continue its efforts . &quot; It ' s never going_to be over if the people of Simi Valley don ' t feel that the schools are teaching the best way for their kids , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
