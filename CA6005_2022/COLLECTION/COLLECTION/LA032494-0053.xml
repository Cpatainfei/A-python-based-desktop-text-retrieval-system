   <HEADLINE> SCOTT HARRIS : A SMALL FILM FEST WITHOUT THE ' F-WORD '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Hollywood had made &quot; Seasons of the Heart , &quot; the villain would have been more vivid . Jed and Martha Richards , pioneers trekking across the Old West , would have lost their little_girls to outlaws or &quot; Injuns , &quot; not illness . And the old preacher who matches the grieving couple with an orphan boy , he ' d be a rascal -- an Elmer Gantry type , perhaps , with an eye on the pretty young wife . But Deborah G . Hofstedt , the minivan-driving Mormon mother of three who wrote the screenplay , never felt pressured to put sex or shootouts into this tale . Feature_Films for Families , a budget-conscious studio based in Utah , doesn ' t do_it Hollywood ' s way . &quot; Seasons of the Heart , &quot; then , was an apt beginning for a new film festival set_in Santa Clarita , a suburban haven beyond the north rim of the San Fernando Valley that prides itself as a great place to raise the kids . The Santa Clarita Valley International Film Festival , which closes today , has no film racier than PG . As organizer Chris Shoemaker puts it , you might hear a &quot; damn &quot; here and a &quot; hell &quot; there , but you won ' t hear &quot; the F-word. &quot; But please , please , don ' t think this is a conclave of prudes and Puritans . &quot; Look , &quot; Shoemaker confides , &quot; I thought ' The Crying Game ' was great. &quot; * Shoemaker is wise_to be diplomatic . The Bible Belt and Hollywood have long been at_odds , and now a Democratic Administration is telling the film and TV industry to clean_up its act . But if Santa Clarita ' s film festival is to achieve its aim -- to promote the production of quality family entertainment -- it needs to win_over the movie_makers , not the moralists . &quot; We ' re not trying to proselytize , &quot; Shoemaker says . &quot; We ' re trying to open_up a dialogue. &quot; The problem with &quot; family values , &quot; of course , is defining the terms . Whose values ? Whose family ? Shoemaker and his wife , Suzanne , who make their living producing live entertainment , say the idea is to explore those questions . A family film , they suggest , could feature a gay couple who want to adopt . The Shoemakers conceived the idea for a film festival in August with Mitch Matovich and his wife , Patty Dee . Matovich , 66 , had a career in aerospace before embarking_on his celluloid dreams . His first production was &quot; I Don ' t Buy Kisses Anymore , &quot; a G-rated love_story . They share the conviction that movie_makers are letting_down a huge audience that wants more and better films that parents would feel comfortable sharing with their children . Why is there so_much profanity , violence and sex ? Why doesn ' t Hollywood take more of a cue from the huge box_office of such films as &quot; Aladdin &quot; and &quot; E.T. &quot; ? How about another &quot; Field of Dreams &quot; ? This being Oscar week , it seems safe to say that much of Hollywood was utterly unaware of Santa Clarita ' s answer to Cannes -- and , no , there aren ' t topless beaches up here . Sharon Stone and Steven Seagal didn ' t make_it to this festival , but directors from as far as China and Poland came_to showcase their works . Friz Freleng , the creator of Bugs Bunny , was honored for lifetime achievement . Jerry Mathers , the erstwhile &quot; Beav , &quot; presided over a panel on child actors . Dean Jones , who used to drive &quot; The Love Bug , &quot; participated on the &quot; Morality and the Movies &quot; panel . This panel also provided a platform for film critic Michael Medved , whose book &quot; Hollywood Versus America &quot; takes The Biz to task for exploiting the dark side of human character . Other panelists included advocates of more descriptive ratings to inform parents of a movie ' s content , such_as L for profane language and N for nudity . To them , it ' s a matter of truth in advertising . After a screening of &quot; Seasons of the Heart , &quot; actress Leigh Lombardi agreed that wholesome sometimes seems like a dirty word in Hollywood . &quot; I don ' t see enough roles like this , &quot; said Lombardi , who played the grieving Martha . The actress admits to a sci-fi flick she hopes her mother never sees . &quot; But this one she ' s showing to her church. &quot; &quot; Seasons , &quot; with its strong Christian theme , was made_for video and is sold by mail_order . Alas , it didn ' t get much exposure here . Only six people attended the 5:30 p.m. screening . Screenwriter Hofstedt , who happens to live_in Santa Clarita , brought her 9-year-old daughter , Bonnie . I ' m pretty sure that Hofstedt and Chris Shoemaker would disagree about &quot; The Crying Game. &quot; But both long for a day when the local video store features a wall devoted to quality films they could pick_up with peace_of_mind -- and not just kids ' fare , but movies that parents would enjoy as well . As it is , it ' s easier to find a section labeled &quot; adult , &quot; most of which is produced just down the quake-damaged freeway in the big , bad Valley . Utah , it ain ' t . But at least truth in advertising isn ' t a problem . Just look_at the video boxes .</TEXT>
