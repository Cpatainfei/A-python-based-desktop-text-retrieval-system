   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE ; A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE ; UC IRVINE BOOKSTORE WINS ACCLAIM FOR ITS INTERNET ADVERTISING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s 6:30 p.m. , and Michael Kiley , associate director of the UC Irvine bookstore , is rushing_off to Japanese class . &quot; I need to learn just some rudimentary stuff so I can handle orders from Japan , &quot; he says . The bookstore has been drawing as_many as 120 # 000 browsers a week from around the globe since it began advertising on the Internet . Among its biggest customers , Kiley said , have been Japanese academics seeking technical books published only in English , and aficionados of Japanese animation art , called anime . Although Kiley started the venture in April just for fun , his experiment is drawing national acclaim and is even helping to set the standard for Internet advertising . &quot; They have an excellent format , &quot; said David Scott Lewis , editor of the electronics_industry magazine Hot Off the Tree . &quot; It is one of the best I have seen. &quot; Kiley describes the service as the only on-line college bookstore in the world . Books , records , CD-ROMs and sweat shirts are displayed on the World Wide Web , a subset of the Internet -- a group of computer_networks linking an estimated 30 million computer users around the globe . The World Wide Web offers not only standard text but also color pictures , video displays and sound . The UCI bookstore ' s Web venture has not been terribly lucrative yet , Kiley said , drawing about $ 5 # 000 worth of electronic_mail orders a month . But he and others see great profit potential for the future . &quot; Everyone is doing_it now , &quot; Lewis said , citing the consortium of computer makers -- including Hewlett-Packard , IBM and Apple -- that recently entered the on-line marketplace by offering home computer_accessories for_sale on the Web . Multinational corporations , among them Pizza Hut and Hilton Hotels , are also experimenting with Internet advertising . Students across Southern California see the UCI cyberstore as a welcome alternative to fighting over textbooks and standing_in long lines to make purchases . UCLA student Joshua Chou said he shops electronically at the UCI store because he likes the easy pace . He can browse through the inventory from his computer terminal at_home , then send his orders by electronic_mail . The store also courts repeat business by offering a 10 % yearly discount to e-mail customers , who pay an annual $ 10 membership fee . The price break and the convenience , Chou said , keep him coming_back . The World Wide Web is only about 5 years old , and the idea of advertising on it is even younger . Companies that do use it typically make presentations similar to that of Hilton , which adds color photos to text so that its displays resemble magazine pages . &quot; UCI ' s site is very attractive , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; I have seen sites that are more attractive , but they don ' t have a lot of content. &quot; UCI is_on the cutting edge , designing dozens of pages that combine text with color pictures , graphics and sounds such_as narration and music . A recent promotion for a travel book titled &quot; The Big Island of Hawaii &quot; included an interactive map that allowed readers to get information about specific points of interest on the island . &quot; We use it to draw people into the site , &quot; Kiley said , &quot; and hope that once they are there they will browse. &quot; UCI ' s biggest on-line sellers , technical books , typically do not have great visual appeal , he said , but the store hopes to attract people drawn to the site by travel and other picture_books . So far , UCI has also managed to market on the Web without drawing criticism from purists who say there is no room for commerce on the Internet . A heated debate on that topic began in April when two Arizona lawyers sent e-mail advertisements for their services to millions of Internet users . They were bombarded by thousands of messages from outraged subscribers warning them that they had violated an unwritten_law prohibiting unsolicited commercial_messages . Lewis said the UCI bookstore ads are not prompting a similar outcry because , unlike the e-mail messages , these ads must be sought_out . Besides , he said , the UCI idea is in sync with the interests of the Internet ' s technology-savvy subscribers . &quot; There is tremendous demand for a service like this , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; I can ' t tell you how many times in the user groups people ask where to find books on certain topics. &quot; Hiroshi Deguchi , a professor of communications at the International University of Japan , shops for books on subjects such_as econometrics and set_theory . Those English texts are difficult to find in Japan , he said . UCI ' s selection is excellent , Deguchi said , as is the bookstore ' s service . The other big draw after technical publications is the extensive inventory of anime , including comics , books , videos , laser discs and CD-ROMs . Mats Roger Nielsen has become a frequent UCI shopper since discovering the anime collection last year . Anime , he said , is nearly impossible to find in his country , Norway , and browsing the UCI Web site is much cheaper and faster than making inquiries to bookstores by regular mail . &quot; Living_in Norway , regular mail to and from California takes at least five days , &quot; Nielsen said . &quot; With e-mail , I get answers to my numerous questions the next day , even with a nine-hour time difference -- and for free. &quot;</TEXT>
