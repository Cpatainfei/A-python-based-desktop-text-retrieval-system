   <HEADLINE> HEALTH PROGRAM COULD REALIGN WORK_FORCE ; REFORM : BUDGET OFFICE WARNS THAT SKILLED-UNSKILLED GAP COULD WIDEN . SMALL FIRMS MIGHT KEEP WAGES LOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The issue has been overshadowed so far by the debate over government spending , but congressional analysts warn that President Clinton ' s health_care reform plan could contribute to a fundamental restructuring of the U.S. work_force . According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office , the Clinton plan could widen the existing divide between professional and unskilled workers , accelerate the trend toward corporate &quot; outsourcing &quot; of work to independent contractors and create new incentives for small businesses to stay small and keep wages low . The CBO analysis , while not intended as an attack on the Clinton plan , could provide new ammunition to congressional opponents who hope to stop the White_House from rewriting the rules governing a sector that accounts_for one-seventh of the nation ' s economy . The nonpartisan budget agency , which prepares financial analyses at the request of Congress , says some of the labor_market changes it foresees could work to the advantage of employees . And it notes that the existing system , which leaves 37 million Americans without health_insurance and forces others to pay far more_than their fair share , is hardly_a model of fairness or efficiency . Still , the budget office ' s predictions about potential employment impact could increase the wariness of lawmakers who are already hesitant to endorse what is arguably the largest piece of social legislation in the nation ' s history . &quot; Any plan that is this complicated is going_to have all sorts of unintended consequences , &quot; said Rudy Penner , an analyst at KPMG Peat Marwick , a Washington consulting_firm . &quot; We could sit for hours and only think_of a fraction of them . &quot; It takes a lot of poring over the details to recognize all_of the possible consequences , and I ' m sure we missed a lot of them , &quot; said CBO Director Robert D . Reischauer . &quot; If you make a big change like this , you suddenly get all kinds of consequences that you didn ' t think of. &quot; Administration officials acknowledge that they recognized the potential for labor_market disruptions long before Reischauer released the CBO analysis , which said the health plan should be regarded_as a vast new government entitlement program and estimated that it would cause the federal_deficit to balloon in the near term . But the Administration officials said they saw no reason to call attention to the employment impact . &quot; We were surprised no one picked_up on this before CBO , &quot; said one senior Administration policy-maker who requested anonymity . &quot; We didn ' t really hide it ; we just didn ' t stick it in your face for you to see. &quot; The potential work_force changes identified by the CBO are largely attributable to the Administration ' s decision to soften the blow of health_care reform on small-business proprietors , who are among the most vocal opponents of mandatory universal coverage . Under the Clinton plan , all employers would be required to provide health_insurance for their workers and to pick_up most of the cost . Once the plan was fully phased_in , no company would be required to spend more_than 7.9 % of its total payroll for health coverage . But small firms with many low-wage employees would get a big break : Depending_on their size and average wages , the maximum contribution would be reduced to as little as 3.5 % of payroll . The government would pick_up the difference . The impact of the subsidies could be dramatic . The CBO estimates that a typical employer whose workers receive an average of $ 40 # 000 a year would be required to pay an unsubsidized premium of $ 2 # 031 for each single employee on its payroll . But a small firm employing unskilled workers whose wages average $ 10 # 000 a year would qualify for the maximum subsidy , lowering its cost per employee to only $ 350 . Under the Clinton plan , the less an employer paid its workers , the bigger the subsidy it would receive . The CBO warns that the subsidies could contribute to the stratification of the U.S. work_force by creating incentives for low-paid workers to migrate to small employers , and for well-paid , highly educated workers to congregate at bigger companies . The potential impact on the labor_market is enormous , the budget office said . By 1998 , an estimated 8 million low-wage workers now working for larger employers would be worth considerably more to small firms that qualify for the health_care subsidies . The CBO predicts that 20 % , or 1.6 million , of those workers would actually change jobs . Some would go voluntarily because subsidized firms could afford to pay them more . Some would be forced to make the move as the private sector restructured itself in response to the Clinton plan . The potential shift would be so large that it could add $ 12 billion a year to the cost of the government subsidies starting in the year 2004 , the CBO analysis said . &quot; Workers at different wage levels would have an incentive to work for different firms , &quot; it said , noting that the creation of two classes of employers -- a phenomenon it calls &quot; labor sorting &quot; -- would &quot; reduce the efficiency of the labor market. &quot; The long-term impact on the U.S. economy is far from certain . &quot; The reason this is a problem is that corporations might start doing things that don ' t make economic sense at all except to take_advantage of these federal subsidies , &quot; said John Shiels , a health_care expert with Lewin-VHI , a Fairfax , Va. , consulting firm that has conducted its own analysis of the Clinton plan . &quot; Corporations might begin to organize themselves in ways they otherwise would n ' t , and become less efficient as a result , &quot; Shiels said . &quot; Those inefficiencies should be counted as part of the costs of health reform. &quot; Corporations are already restructuring in response to health_care costs . The difference is that they are now divided between those that provide private insurance and those that don ' t . &quot; You have got_to remember that the current system has plenty of unintended consequences of its own , &quot; Reischauer said . The CBO analysis assumes that lower-paid workers would gradually migrate to smaller employers because of the economic_value of the subsidies . For example , in a city where the prevailing wage for janitors is $ 15 # 000 a year , a big employer with a sizable number of higher-paid employees would have to pay an additional health_care premium of $ 2 # 000 or so for each new janitor it hired , the CBO calculates . But a small custodial contractor with fewer than 25 employees and no white-collar workers would pay a premium of only about $ 500 because of the payroll cap . All other things being equal , the subsidy would make_it possible for the contractor to bid for the big company ' s custodial work_at less cost than the company was paying to do the work itself . The value of the subsidy could trickle down to workers if the contractor decided to pay his janitors more_than the $ 15 # 000 prevailing wage . Or it might trickle down to consumers if the big company reduced its prices as its operating expenses declined . In either case , taxpayers would be paying the subsidized portion of the health premium . For higher-paid employees and their bosses , the incentives could work in the opposite direction . For a small , subsidized firm , the presence of one or more highly paid professionals on the payroll would reduce the value of the government subsidy , since it would be based on a percentage of total wages paid . But at bigger firms , where total premiums are not expected to hit the 7.9 % payroll ceiling , big salaries would not necessarily increase health_care outlays . &quot; You could end_up with a situation where a company like Microsoft , which has lots of highly paid workers , will spin_off its janitorial service to take_advantage of subsidies , while a company like McDonald ' s , which has lots of low-wage workers and only a_few high-paid executives , will spin_off its professional staff into a separate entity to avoid higher costs , &quot; said one White_House official . &quot; We don ' t know how much of that will take place. &quot; Reischauer predicts that small firms might eliminate highly paid jobs by doing such things as contracting out for advertising and legal work , allowing them to shut_down in-house departments . White_House officials say labor_market distortions are among the first issues they will attempt to address as they try to respond to the CBO analysis of the Clinton plan . The most likely modification is one the Clinton health_care task_force considered , but rejected , as it developed its plan last year , according to one Administration official . The premium subsidies could be channeled to individual workers who qualify , rather than being funneled to corporations to cover their overall payroll costs . That would eliminate the incentive for firms to divide themselves along subsidized and non-subsidized lines . White_House officials said they originally rejected that idea largely for political reasons : It would let rich law_firms and investment_companies enjoy the benefits of having some of their lower-paid workers receive subsidies . But fixing one unintended consequence could lead to yet another . &quot; It is things like this that make me a gradualist when it comes_to public policy , &quot; Penner said . &quot; This plan , after all , is the equivalent of creating not one , but several new federal entitlement programs all layered on top of each other . And we are all just making guesses about what this plan would do. &quot;</TEXT>
