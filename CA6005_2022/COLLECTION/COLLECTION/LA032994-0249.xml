   <HEADLINE> BILLS WOULD TIGHTEN LAW ON OPEN MEETINGS ; LEGISLATION : THE GOVERNOR IS EXPECTED TO SIGN FINAL MEASURE OF A FOUR-PART PACKAGE AIMED AT KEEPING ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM STRIKING DEALS WITHOUT PUBLIC INPUT . ADDITIONS TO BROWN ACT WOULD APPLY ONLY TO LOCAL AGENCIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Legislature has sent Gov . Pete Wilson the last of several bills requiring local elected officials to conduct their business more openly -- not , for example , at out-of-town &quot; retreats &quot; or in small , private gatherings . Wilson is expected to sign the so-called sunshine legislation quickly so that it will become law by Friday , the effective date of a three-bill package passed_by the Legislature and signed by the governor last year . Together the four bills represent one of the few substantial tightenings of the 40-year-old Ralph M . Brown Act anti-secrecy law , which requires local elected officials of public agencies and school_boards to meet and make decisions in public . Final legislative approval came Thursday when the Senate sent the last bill , by Sen . Quentin Kopp ( I-San Francisco ) , to Wilson on a 37-0 vote . Earlier , the Assembly approved it 56-1 . Among the new restrictions : Local elected officials would no longer be allowed to meet in private just by ensuring that the group did not constitute a quorum . They also could not travel_to a secluded spot out of their area , far from public view , to hold meetings . Such abuses , which critics maintain violated the spirit if not the letter of the Brown Act , fueled a two-year effort by newspaper_publishers , broadcasters and other journalists to toughen the law . Complaints also have come from within public bodies . Two Pasadena City_Council members said in August that four of their colleagues -- a majority on the seven member council -- met in an anteroom during a council break to hash out a compromise on an anti-smoking ordinance . The city attorney later ruled that the gathering was not a meeting . In 1992 , Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina said she was present repeatedly , over her objections , at closed-door sessions of the board that she believes violated the law . On one occasion , she said the board went_into closed_session to hear a county department chief lobby them on an issue . But Molina did not object when she and her four colleagues , in a session that almost certainly would be illegal under the new law , met with Wilson in Sacramento last spring to discuss Wilson ' s proposal to shift property_tax revenues from counties to schools . The county ' s top lawyer said the get-together was not a meeting under the law , only a discussion with five individuals and the governor . In order to give city_council members , county supervisors , school_board trustees , other officials and their attorneys extra_time to digest the changes , the new sunshine statutes were targeted to become law April 1 -- three months later than most 1994 laws . For local officials who make reasonable efforts to keep the public informed of their activities , the new law is not expected to have a major impact , said Terry Franke , whose First_Amendment Coalition helped push the overhaul through the Legislature . &quot; The styles that will be cramped will be those who have been secretive , jealous of information and who control the routing and access to information , &quot; Franke said . &quot; Those folks are going_to need to change their act. &quot; The four-bill package by Kopp , a former San Francisco supervisor , Assemblyman John L . Burton ( D-San Francisco ) and Sen . Charles Calderon ( D-Whittier ) applies only to local governmental agencies and not to state entities or the Legislature . Wilson , a former mayor of San Diego , vetoed a similar proposal in 1992 on the grounds that it would have increased costs . Last year , he signed a compromise version after it was rewritten to meet his objections . The newest Brown Act changes were achieved during lengthy negotiations between representatives of the First_Amendment Coalition and advocates for cities , counties , special districts and school_boards . Key features include : * Removing obstacles to prosecuting a Brown Act violation , a misdemeanor . Under the old law , prosecutors had the problem of proving that officials knew they were attending a meeting banned under the act . Under the new laws , ignorance of open meeting requirements no longer would be the &quot; perfect defense &quot; of accused officials , supporters of the bill said . * Citizens would be given additional time to detect an alleged violation before formally demanding that a local governing board take action to correct the offense . * Local_government entities would have to hold meetings within their own jurisdictions , with limited exceptions . The restriction is intended to prohibit elected officials from traveling_to distant &quot; retreats &quot; where , critics charge , public business can be discussed out of public view . * Meetings of standing_committees of less than a quorum of a legislative body such_as a city_council would be open and public . Critics have argued that some governing boards structure the membership of their policy-making committees to avoid open meeting requirements . * No longer could a citizen be ordered silenced for voicing criticism of the governing body he or she is addressing . Proponents of the new law cited instances of some school_boards stifling public comment by declaring an issue to be an off-limits &quot; personnel matter. &quot; * Citizens would be specifically empowered to make audio- and videotapes , still photographs , or movies of local_government agency meetings , provided the activity is not disruptive . Likewise , recordings of sessions taped by the agency would be made available to the public for at least 30 days . * Newly elected members of a local governing board who have not yet taken the oath of office would be covered by the Brown Act . In part , this is in intended to prohibit these officials from privately making decisions before they are sworn_in and later ratifying them without participation by the public . * Governing boards of local agencies would be required to disclose in public sessions any final actions taken_in closed meetings . Closed_sessions are permitted for discussion and action on certain subjects , including personnel matters and pending litigation , but critics say sessions are often closed when there is only a vague connection to private matters . Franke said citizens often have found after the fact that a school_superintendent , city_manager or other executive got a salary increase during a closed meeting , &quot; but they are never told what the proposed raise will be. &quot; &quot; In many agencies , the largest single expenditure all year long will be the salary of the top manager , ( who ) may be the best-compensated person in town , &quot; Franke said . Times staff writer Daniel M . Weintraub contributed to this report . BACKGROUND Under state law , local elected bodies -- such_as county boards of supervisors , city_councils and school_boards -- are required to meet and make their decisions in public . With a_few exceptions , the Ralph M . Brown Act prohibits elected officials from meeting or taking action in private . But in recent years , news media and public access groups have complained that elected officials have violated or skirted the Brown Act with increasing frequency . Critics further note that officials seldom , if ever , are prosecuted under misdemeanor provisions of the act . Recently the Legislature tightened the law and Gov . Pete Wilson is considering whether to sign the changes into law .</TEXT>
