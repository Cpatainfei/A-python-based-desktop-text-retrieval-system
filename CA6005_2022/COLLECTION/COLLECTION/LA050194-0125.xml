   <HEADLINE> STARDUST , GOLDEN AND MARKETABLE ; AS A TOWN BRACES FOR A 25TH-ANNIVERSARY FESTIVAL , THE TASK OF ORGANIZING -- AND SELLING -- A WOODSTOCK FOR THE ' 90S BEGINS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Located in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains , this town of 18 # 000 is not far from where , once upon a time , Rip_Van_Winkle took a very long nap . Now Saugerties and the rest of the Hudson_River Valley are braced for the reawakening of an equally colorful visitor -- the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair -- and on one recent night , locals filled the town ' s Senior_Citizens Center to debate whether Woodstock Ventures should be permitted to reprise the watershed festival at a nearby farm . After the Pledge of Allegiance , people stepped_up to a microphone to address the town board , concert promoter Michael Lang and a standing-room-only crowd of more_than 300 . John Hall , leader of the rock_group Orleans , was the first to speak . Hall , who has lived_in Saugerties for more_than 20 years , recently served as a county legislator , a political activity prompted by his opposition to a proposal to locate Ulster County ' s megadump at Winston Farm , the proposed site of Woodstock ' 94 . &quot; I understand the trepidation of anyone who fears the arrival of so many people , &quot; said Hall , referring to the 250 # 000 rock fans guaranteed to flock to the silver anniversary event on Aug . 13 and 14 . &quot; In my opinion , however , it is vastly preferable to having a megadump with 200 # 000 tons of garbage a year arriving on that site for the next 20 years. &quot; Thaddeus Dragula , a local Baptist preacher , begged to differ . &quot; What ' s worse , &quot; he said , &quot; a megadump that pollutes the water or a concert that pollutes our youth ? &quot; Dragula was cheered by a contingent of retirees , conservative Christians and other foes of the festival who sat together at long tables toward the back of the room . While most speakers supported the fest , with many citing the financial boost it would give the beleaguered local economy , opponents called_on the board to reject what they see as a Faustian bargain that would open their town to the social equivalent of a plague of locusts . Keri Sorrin , a 17-year-old high_school student whose hair was streaked pink and green , wasn ' t particularly worried . &quot; As far as our morals are concerned , they ' re already screwed_up , &quot; she said . &quot; Maybe the festival can get us back on the right track. &quot; Romantics remember the 1969 Woodstock Festival -- which took_place in Bethel , N.Y. , 60 miles southwest of Saugerties -- as an impromptu city in which peace and love were the laws_of_the_land . Realists remember Woodstock and consider it a miracle that the worst thing to result from half a_million stoned hippies spending the weekend on a muddy field was a world-class traffic_jam . But perhaps the seminal lesson of the Woodstock Festival was that the so-called counterculture was a whale of a consumer market . Now , 25 years later , the ramifications of that realization are evident in almost every aspect of Woodstock ' 94 . Michael Lang , an architect of the original event , said little at the town_meeting in Saugerties , already confident that the required permits would be secured within weeks . Woodstock Ventures had been negotiating with the town for 10 months , and Lang knew that their hand was strengthened not just by opposition to the dump , but by the fact that IBM , the area ' s biggest blue-chip employer , had laid_off 5 # 000 local employees in the last five years . ( And indeed , after much last-minute financial wrangling , final approvals were granted on April 8. ) Initial bookings for Woodstock ' 94 are rumored to include Peter Gabriel , Aerosmith , Metallica , Alice in Chains , Soundgarden , Red Hot Chili_Peppers , Guns N ' Roses , Neil Young and , returning from the original festival , Santana and Crosby , Stills and Nash . ( The final lineup is expected in about three weeks ; one-third of the acts are reportedly already booked. ) Lang neither confirms nor denies any of these . Pearl Jam , another band also high on the rumor list , has said it has no plans to play the festival . That the Woodstock revival was helped by the downsizing of a corporate giant and fear of a dump are just two of many Aquarian ironies . Woodstock ' 94 is also being bankrolled by PolyGram , which plans to market a film ( Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple shot the meeting in Saugerties ) , a recording and a weekend-long pay-per-view broadcast of the event . Meanwhile , Pepsi is already exploiting Woodstock nostalgia with a commercial featuring a pot joke delivered by two veterans of Yasgur ' s Farm : John Sebastian and Country Joe McDonald . * Talk_of Woodstock ' 94 and another festival slated for the original site in Bethel has heated local conversations throughout a particularly hard winter . Some of the dialogues have even occurred in cyberspace , courtesy of Woodstock Online , which can be reached via modem at 914-679-3040 . The common wisdom in Saugerties is that while the festival won ' t revitalize the economy , it will generate a couple million dollars and publicity that could help attract both business investments and tourist dollars . As for the megadump , it could still end_up at Winston Farm , and fest foes are quick to quip that the debris from the concert might as well be left on the site . Lang has held_out the carrot that if the festival is successful , the farm would be developed as an outdoor venue for summertime concerts . Everybody expects Woodstock ' 94 to cause a weekend of commotion . Though Winston Farm is right next to an exit on the New York State Thruway , nearly all_of the surrounding roads are two-lane affairs . But promoters have emphasized that the event would not re-create the logistic nightmare of the original . One reason is that they ' ve had to submit extensive environmental , security , medical and traffic plans to obtain a variance to the mass-gathering laws enacted after the 1969 festival . A few days after the Saugerties town_meeting , Lang was at his home_in the town of Woodstock , poring over proposed designs for the three stages he plans to erect on the 740-acre farm . &quot; In some cases , &quot; said Lang , who still has the suede vest he wore at the original festival , &quot; I was hearing people say the same things that their parents said in ' 69 . But these days , the opposition is more of a minority , and what it boils_down to is here is a conservative country town embracing Woodstock . How bizarre can you get ? &quot; * In the summer of ' 69 , Duke Devlin hitchhiked to the Woodstock Festival from a commune near Amarillo , Tex . He stayed in Bethel , and commemorated his move with a large tattoo that includes the Woodstock logo of a dove sitting on the neck of a guitar . ( The logo for this year ' s festival depicts a Fender-style guitar neck and two birds. ) Hippie pilgrims have long journeyed to Yasgur ' s Farm , and during the week of the 20th anniversary , a quarter-million people are said to have driven by the counterculture ' s field of dreams . Impromptu festivals have marked the anniversary for years , although last summer the party had to be moved when a promoter who ' d leased the original site in anticipation of the 25th anniversary covered the field with fresh green chicken droppings . &quot; Every time I go_past the original site , &quot; says Devlin , who owns a local farm stand , &quot; I ' m amazed to see kids who weren ' t even born when the festival happened . They seem to have a longing for the peace and love that was there , and are looking_for something to kick it off. &quot; Promoters have long tried to satisfy that need , but over the years , Bethel has had a love-hate ( mostly hate ) relationship with the festival that put it on the map . However , town officials have entertained various 25th-anniversary plans and are currently talking with Sid Bernstein , a music business veteran whose dusty old claim to fame is that he promoted concerts by the Beatles at Carnegie Hall and Shea Stadium . ( See accompanying story , Page 80. ) Observes Devlin : &quot; Bethel has a 300-watt light_bulb , but they ' ve covered it with a bushel basket. &quot; By contrast , Saugerties has all but put_on a light show welcoming Woodstock ' 94 . The festival is once more being produced by Lang and two men from wealthy families who ' ve been business partners since before the first festival , John Roberts and Joel Rosenman . New on the bus to Woodstock is John Scher , a major East Coast concert promoter who also runs the diversified entertainment division of PolyGram . The budget_for the original Woodstock was $ 500 # 000 , although the festival ended_up costing closer to $ 3.3 million . Woodstock ' 94 is a co-production between Woodstock Ventures and PolyGram , which is supplying the $ 19.5-million budget . At the first festival , a &quot; favored nations &quot; booking policy ensured that none of the top acts would receive more_than $ 15 # 000 . Tickets were priced from $ 7 for one day to $ 18 for all three days . Tickets for the two-day Saugerties festival , which will be sold beginning around June 1 through a lottery , are expected to cost about $ 120 . Shortly after Woodstock , Bob Dylan earned $ 150 # 000 to play the Isle of Wight Festival , and rock_concerts became a much more lucrative , arena-oriented business . Industry rumors have top acts at Woodstock ' 94 getting $ 350 # 000 plus points in the offshoot products . * After Jimi Hendrix closed the first festival by playing the &quot; Star-Spangled Banner &quot; on his Stratocaster , the promoters discovered that they were about $ 1.7 million in debt . Roberts and Rosenman bought_out Lang , and then sold a bigger share of the film and recording rights to Warner Bros. , which had already put_up $ 100 # 000 to film the festival and another $ 500 # 000 to edit the footage that became &quot; Woodstock. &quot; Roberts says that the debt was essentially paid_off by 1980 , except that over the years more money was spent to protect a trademark that had come_to define a generation -- &quot; Woodstock. &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; warned Roberts ' father , appalled by his son ' s business venture , &quot; this thing will be haunting you 25 years from now. &quot; He was right ; Woodstock proved as tough to shake as the scent of patchouli . &quot; Philosophically , &quot; adds Rosenman , &quot; it ' s always bothered me that Woodstock worked in all respects but as a business venture. &quot; Promoting the world ' s most famous rock_concert also carries a lot more cachet than the mergers and acquisitions that occupied the partners throughout the 1980s . &quot; We don ' t say we ' re the Richardson Mint guys , &quot; admits Rosenman , citing one of their other business ventures . The Woodstock guys came_to a rude realization , however , when they considered staging a 20th anniversary festival in Berlin that was to bridge both sides of the then-divided city . &quot; When we looked_at our contracts seven or eight years ago , &quot; says Roberts , &quot; we found that we were pretty much married to Warner Bros . They basically had all_the ancillary rights short of live-event profits and merchandising. &quot; The company that ' s now called Time Warner does not have a live concert division and wasn ' t particularly interested in staging another Woodstock . The result was a protracted negotiation between Woodstock Ventures and Warners . The deal that emerged , says Roberts , &quot; was that Warners would retain rights to the original movie and recording , and we bought back the rest . The price was substantial , but our deal with PolyGram was that we had to provide all these rights free and untrammeled. &quot; Warners remains a profit participant in Woodstock ' 94 . If you think such corporate maneuvers belie the Woodstock vibe , hold onto your roach_clip . &quot; In 1969 , &quot; says Lang , &quot; we were not basing the viability of the show on the ancillaries . Who knew from ancillaries ? We didn ' t even have T-shirts. &quot; * Woodstock ' 94 will be_well stocked with ancillaries . Considering that 250 # 000 tickets at $ 120 each would roughly cover producing the festival , the potential profit centers are clearly the pay-per-view television broadcast , the feature_film , the soundtrack album and souvenir merchandise . Roberts also hopes that a revitalized &quot; Woodstock &quot; trademark will facilitate such future plans as a chain of hard-rocking Woodstock cafes . &quot; Woodstock ' 94 reflects the typical pop_music mix of idealism and giant doses of greed , &quot; reflects writer and musician Ed Sanders , a 20-year Woodstock resident best known for his work with the Fugs . &quot; It ' s an event fueled by the credit-card power of 14-year-old kids. &quot; But this Woodstock Nation won ' t have to worry about running_out of cash : there will be automatic_teller_machines on the grounds of Winston Farm . * Woodstock ' s reputation as a &quot; colony of the arts &quot; was born early in the century , when two artists ' communities -- Byrdcliffe and Maverick -- sought to develop lifestyles that integrated arts and crafts with advanced social ideals . Before long , Woodstock became known as the Greenwich_Village of the Catskills . Beat-era artists came_in the 1950s . In the ' 60s , the late Albert Grossman , one of the most powerful music managers of the decade , moved to town and brought along such clients as Bob Dylan and the Band . By the time Dylan had his motorcycle accident on Zena Road , Woodstock was known to a whole generation of hippies . Throughout the years , however , there has been consistent friction between the town ' s bohemian elements and its more typically rural citizens . Back in the late ' 60s , Michael Lang was laughed out of town when he proposed staging the Woodstock Festival in , of all places , Woodstock . It was bad enough , some complained , that longhairs arrived on the Village_Green looking_for Dylan or Big Pink . ( The Band ' s famous house , immortalized by the group ' s classic album &quot; Music From Big Pink , &quot; actually is in West Saugerties. ) Yet Woodstock has long benefited from the festival that borrowed its name . Twenty-five years worth of tourists have passed_through town looking_for Yasgur ' s Farm . The pizza_shop bears a variation on the Woodstock logo , while local radio_station WDST relishes the resonance of calling itself Radio Woodstock . One guy even carved_up an acre of land into square-inch plots to sell as souvenirs . Still , with Woodstock ' 94 now literally down the road , everybody ' s expecting a crazy summer , including Family of Woodstock , a social_service organization originally formed to handle transient hippies who hung_around after the ' 69 festival . They ' ve been contracted to help with its sequel . A striking element of the debate over Woodstock ' 94 is how opponents fear that crime and violence will replace peace and love . It ' s not like 1969 , this logic goes , when sex was safe , drugs were recreational , and rock ' n ' roll was , well , rock ' n ' roll . &quot; These days , &quot; said an unidentified police_officer in the local paper , &quot; it ' s not just ' take a little LSD and go_to_sleep ; ' now it ' s guns and drugs , stealing and killing. &quot; Nobody was searched for weapons on the way to Woodstock ; that won ' t be the case at Woodstock ' 94 . At Woodstock , the promoters were so busy putting_up the stage that there was no time to construct a proper entrance where people could buy tickets . At Woodstock ' 94 , no tickets will be available at the gate , and Winston Farm will be surrounded by an eight-foot fence patrolled by security_guards . A controversy over the presumed appearance of Guns N ' Roses also suggests that the promoters of Woodstock ' 94 will be held to a different standard than if they were staging just another rock show . Because the very name Woodstock suggests all sorts of hippie ideals , citizens of the Woodstock Nation will be watching to see if the music at the festival is politically correct . Opposition to Guns N ' Roses has brought_together some strange bedfellows . Dragula , the preacher , sees the band as embodying all that is evil about rock ' n ' roll . Sanders , who wrote a book about the Charles Manson murders , &quot; The Family , &quot; objects to the band recording one of Manson ' s songs , and Axl Rose wearing his image on a T-shirt . &quot; There is a liberal / conservative schism in terms of who supports the festival , &quot; explains Sanders , &quot; but there are also plenty of liberals who aren ' t too happy about a quarter-million 18- to 24-year-old people watching Guns N ' Roses. &quot; * Levon Helm of the Band , who has lived_in Woodstock for most of the past 25 years , hopes that Woodstock ' 94 will prove to be a peaceful tonic . &quot; When the first festival came_around , &quot; he says , &quot; things were a lot softer , and people were more tolerant of each other . I ' d like to see this festival work_out a little of our meanness. &quot; Helm would also like to see a &quot; survivors slot &quot; at Woodstock ' 94 for the Band . He ' s not the only one looking_for a payday . The town of Saugerties has bargained the richest deal , with a cut of $ 4 per ticket fairly guaranteeing a $ 1-million windfall , an additional $ 150 # 000 to finance the permit process and $ 350 # 000 set_aside for additional expenses . Ulster County will get $ 1.40 per ticket . The promoters will also take_out a $ 50-million insurance_policy to cover unexpected expenses incurred by both the town and Ulster County . Surrounding towns , including Woodstock , are also negotiating with the promoters to assume their costs . &quot; August is_on Michael Lang , &quot; jokes Sanders , &quot; and I ' m encouraging everybody in Woodstock to send him their therapy bills. &quot; Sanders has his own piece of the action : Fantasy Records will release a live album called &quot; The Fugs Celebrate the Woodstock Festival. &quot; The Howard Johnson Lodge directly across from Winston Farm has already sold_out its rooms for the August weekend at a rate of $ 350 a night , up from a normal high of $ 80 . Other motels are charging_up to $ 1 # 200 for three nights . One company has reserved more_than 600 area hotel_rooms with an eye toward charging sky-high prices at festival time . Day Yusko , a middle-aged hippie who cuts hair and sells a variety of crafts out of a storefront in Woodstock , would like to kick the money-changers out of the festival . Yusko , a longtime activist in the loose-knit clan known as the Rainbow Family , says that after the group ' s annual Fourth_of_July gathering , many will head for Woodstock . &quot; People are going_to come and unfold their tents wherever they can , &quot; says Yusko , who predicts that many thousands will come_to the area without tickets to the Saugerties festival . &quot; People respond to the fact that a new religion was born at Woodstock based on the spirit of sharing and caring . And they also won ' t want to miss the party of the century. &quot; The first to come , says Yusko , will be the &quot; road dogs. &quot; These nomadic hitchhikers , he explains , are the scouts who will seek_out campsites in the area and comb the mountains abutting Winston Farm to look_for free passage into the festival . Lang is no road dog , but he still hopes that Woodstock ' 94 will reflect the soul of the original . &quot; There ' s a tremendous amount of interest in the ' 60s again , &quot; he says , &quot; but instead of mere nostalgia , we want Woodstock ' 94 to be a forum to pass along that spirit to a new generation. &quot; Woody and Louise Sperl have spent 47 quiet years in a small home that borders Winston Farm . Their children grew_up playing_on the farm ' s vast fields , and now also live_in houses that border the property that will host Woodstock ' 94 . &quot; It ' s certainly not going_to be your average weekend , &quot; says Louise who , like her husband , is 71 , &quot; but then , we ' ve just been through a winter with 17 snowstorms. &quot; &quot; If the music sounds halfway good , &quot; continues Louise , &quot; I ' ll sit in the back yard . If not , I ' ll turn_on the air-conditioning and listen to Garth Brooks. &quot;</TEXT>
