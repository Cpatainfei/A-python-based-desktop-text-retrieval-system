   <HEADLINE> WHEN PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW TAKES A BACK SEAT IN COURT ; LAW : THERE ARE MANY REASONS JUDGES KEEP DOCUMENTS OR OTHER ITEMS , LIKE SIMPSON MYSTERY ENVELOPE , SECRET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just before the Fourth_of_July weekend began , a Los Angeles judge revealed that O.J. Simpson ' s defense_lawyers had turned_over a bulky manila envelope , setting_off speculation that the envelope contains evidence critical to the outcome of the former football star ' s double murder case . The contents of the envelope have remained a mystery to prosecutors , who asked to see them . Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito is scheduled to rule on that request Thursday , but it is possible that the envelope ' s contents never will be revealed publicly . Although people accused of crimes are guaranteed a speedy and public trial by the Constitution , elements of these proceedings sometimes take_place behind closed doors . Indeed , some documents filed_in both criminal and civil cases remain secret forever . Some things are routinely kept_from the public -- at least temporarily -- in an attempt to avoid potentially prejudicial publicity , said USC constitutional law professor Erwin Chemerinsky . For example , on Friday , Judge Ito refused to allow the news media to view photos of the bloody bodies of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman , at least until he has ruled on whether those photos will be admitted into evidence during Simpson ' s trial . Thus far , eight motions and five court_orders have been filed under seal_in the Simpson case , according to a court log . Sealed motions are not unusual , but like everything else in this case , these have aroused considerable curiosity -- and speculation . &quot; The opportunity for both the state and the defendant to present their evidence and make their arguments to legal decision-makers ( judges and juries ) , and the right of the public to have access to these proceedings to ensure their legitimacy , are two fundamental attributes of due_process , &quot; said UCLA criminal_law professor Peter Arenella . &quot; But the secret ex parte hearings ( when the judge meets with only one side ) to consider sealed motions in the Simpson case illustrate that sometimes both the public ' s right of access and the opposing party ' s opportunity to be heard can be either denied or at least delayed to protect countervailing interests , &quot; Arenella said . &quot; These might include the confidentiality of attorney-client communications , the privacy rights of third_parties , the security of witnesses and the need to prevent disclosure of potential trial strategy to the opposing party prior to trial , &quot; he added . In some instances , both the public and one side -- the prosecution or the defense -- are kept_in the dark about something , such_as the contents of the manila envelope . In other instances , only the news media , and by extension the public , are kept_in the dark . Sometimes the parties in a case find themselves litigating ferociously over access to information . Occasionally , as with the photos in the Simpson case , the prosecution and the defense join to keep something secret from the public , at least temporarily . Both Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark and defense_lawyer Robert L . Shapiro say that allowing the media to see and describe the photos could endanger Simpson ' s right to a fair trial . Sometimes , courts have overruled objections to showing potentially prejudicial material . In 1983 a federal appeals court in Los Angeles ruled , before auto mogul John Z . DeLorean ' s trial , that CBS could show surveillance tapes of him engaged in a drug sting . ( DeLorean was acquitted. ) Appellate Judge William Norris said the court had to &quot; resolve the tension &quot; between DeLorean ' s right to an impartial jury and the right of the news media to be free from governmental restraints that violate the 1st Amendment . The appeals court panel ruled that both defense and prosecution , who objected to airing the tapes , had failed to demonstrate that it was impossible to get an impartial jury except by halting broadcast of the tapes . Although there is a long line of cases stating that trials and preliminary hearings are open_to the public , other decisions make_it clear that the public -- and sometimes either the defense or the prosecution -- cannot get immediate access to all_the material in a case . &quot; The public has no general 1st Amendment right of access to participate in discovery proceedings between the prosecution and the defense prior to trial , &quot; Arenella said . Loyola Law_School professor Laurie Levenson said material is typically sealed &quot; when one side does not want the other side to see something and has a legitimate concern that would justify keeping something confidential. &quot; But a lawyer cannot simply get something sealed on a whim , stressed Los Angeles defense_lawyer Gerald L . Chaleff . &quot; When you file a motion under seal , it has to relate to something that is privileged or the lawyer has to give some_other reason why the material should not become public , &quot; he said . San Diego criminal defense_attorney Elisabeth Semel said some material almost always can be sealed . One classic example , she said , is a lawyer representing an indigent defendant asking a judge for money to hire an expert witness . The reason such a request is kept secret from the other side is that it reveals the lawyer ' s strategy and thus could endanger the client ' s right to a fair trial if disclosed , Semel said . Beyond that , she said , a lawyer ' s affidavit supporting the request generally reflects attorney-client conversations whose disclosure would violate the sanctity of privileged communications . In one case , Semel was allowed to keep sealed her explanation to a judge about why she wanted California Corrections Department records about an inmate who might testify against her client in a murder trial . But a California appeals court ruled that the prosecutors were entitled both to know about her request and to get copies of the records . Closed-door hearings between a judge and a prosecutor are frequently held after a defense_lawyer has requested internal police_department records of a potential police witness . In such hearings , the judge generally examines the records and assesses their relevance . The records the judge deems relevant are turned_over to the defense_lawyer and the others are not . The defense_lawyer is not entitled to be present at this hearing . Another classic example is a prosecutor requesting a protective order so that the defense cannot learn a potential prosecution witness ' s address , lest that disclosure endanger the potential witness . Such requests are granted often , much to the vexation of defense_lawyers . &quot; It makes_it very hard to impeach a witness if you don ' t know where he lives , &quot; because it makes_it more difficult to do research on the witness , said Los Angeles defense_lawyer Leslie Abramson . Some requests are unusual . After Los Angeles defense_lawyer Andrew Stein doubted an alibi offered by a man he was defending on murder_charges , he filed a sealed motion asking the court to pay_for a documents examiner . His client had claimed to be interviewing for a job when the murder occurred . The examiner , Stein explained , could study employment office records for authenticity . The judge agreed , an examiner was hired , and because the examination cast doubt on the reliability of the documents , Stein did not offer the alibi at trial . His client was convicted and the document remains under seal . The outer boundaries of what can be sealed are murky , leading to vigorous battles during the early phases of cases . In the Menendez brothers murder case , for example , prosecutors learned that the defendants had made some potentially incriminating statements to a psychologist . Contending that the therapist-patient privilege had been breached by discussion of the possible commission of a crime , prosecutors argued for access to tapes of those conversations . The defense vigorously opposed this move , and filed sealed motions arguing against prosecutors ' access and explaining its reasons in a closed hearing before the judge . Ultimately , the judge ruled that some parts of the tapes should be given to prosecutors , and others should not . The prosecution used the tapes at trial , but the other conversations remain under seal . Among the other items that may be kept_out of public view at least temporarily are search_warrants and the police affidavits explaining why the warrants are needed . Both the warrants and the supporting affidavits usually become public within days after the warrants have been served . Yet an affidavit from a federal prosecutor outlining why the government was entitled to bug FBI_agent Richard Miller , later convicted of passing secret information to the Soviets , has never been unsealed , according to Stanley Greenberg , one of Miller ' s lawyers . Greenberg said he suspected that is because it would reveal the name of a confidential informant , perhaps endangering the person . &quot; We had to question the legality of the electronic_surveillance without knowing the ' probable_cause ' that justified it , &quot; Greenberg said . As such cases illustrate , Levenson noted , the entire process of sealed motions is based on the assumption that the judge will consider the interest of the side that is not at the closed hearing . But despite that , the absent party often feels frustrated and powerless . &quot; It ' s like shooting blindfolded , &quot; she said . In one high-profile 1990 trial in Los Angeles , sealed motions led to open warfare . Defense_lawyers for a Mexican businessman accused of playing a lead role in a conspiracy to murder U.S. drug enforcement agent Enrique Camarena asked Los Angeles federal Judge Edward Rafeedie to remove himself from the case unless he agreed to turn_over numerous documents prosecutors filed_in secret . For six months , between August , 1989 , and February , 1990 , prosecutors filed eight sealed motions . The defense countered that the documents might contain material that could help them fight the government ' s case , and said their effort was being damaged by the prosecutors ' &quot; one-way dialogue &quot; with the judge . Prosecutors frequently use such sealed motions in drug cases to protect confidential informants or to withhold the identity of potential witnesses for as long as possible . Rafeedie declined to leave the case and told defense_lawyers they were not entitled to the material , citing several appellate_court decisions permitting the government to make secret filings . As these cases demonstrate , the trial_judge generally has broad latitude over what material can be kept confidential and for how long . Indeed , Judge Ito , responding to a request from The Times and several other news media organizations , last week released a transcript of a closed-door proceeding in which attorneys discussed phone records of a call to Nicole Simpson . Ito kept other transcripts sealed for now : one involving witness security , and two others of his meetings with defense_attorneys . Two other transcripts involve the contents of the mystery envelope , he said . While it is possible that Simpson prosecutors will learn what ' s in the envelope this week , it seems doubtful that the public will , Arenella said . The UCLA professor offered a scenario based on the suggestion that the envelope contains a knife that witnesses said Simpson purchased at a Downtown shop . &quot; Let ' s assume it ' s the knife Simpson purchased at Ross Cutlery but the knife is not , in fact , the murder weapon , &quot; Arenella said . &quot; In these circumstances , it is highly likely that the evidence could be presented by the defense at Mr. Simpson ' s trial , if the prosecution decides to call to the witness_stand the people from the shop who sold him the knife . In such a scenario , the defense would introduce the knife to rebut the prosecution ' s suggestion that this could be the murder weapon. &quot; A key reason the defense would not have kept_back the knife to flourish at the trial is that 30 days before the trial begins -- which would be later this week -- the prosecution is entitled to see any evidence the defense plans to use . The prosecution , however , would not decide until after it had forensic tests performed whether to use at trial either the knife or the people who sold it to Simpson . So , Arenella said , &quot; I don ' t see why the public would have any right of access to this material at this juncture because it ' s not evidence yet . The public ' s right of access is dependent_on whether it will become trial evidence. &quot; Another possibility , Arenella said , is that the knife is the murder weapon -- incriminating evidence that could point to Simpson or someone else . &quot; If it points to Simpson , the prosecution will be given access to the knife . The public will see it at the trial , but there would be no statement about the source of the knife , &quot; Arenella said . That is because other cases have held that it would be excessively prejudicial for a jury to be told that a defendant ' s lawyer had handed_over the murder weapon . Yet another possibility is that the prosecutors will decide not to use the cutlery salesmen as witnesses and therefore the knife will become irrelevant . And of course , Arenella stressed , it is entirely possible that the envelope contains something else , raising a host of other scenarios . Given the intense curiosity about the Simpson case , Arenella said he thinks it likely that the contents of the envelope ultimately will be revealed -- perhaps by a leak from one side or the other .</TEXT>
