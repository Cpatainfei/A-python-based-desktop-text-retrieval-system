   <HEADLINE> PACIFIC RIM TRADE ; JAPAN ; TRADING COMPANIES POWER TOKYO ' S ECONOMIC EXPANSION ; WITH THEIR VAST NETWORKS OF EMPLOYEES AND CONTACTS , SOGO SHOSHA FIND BUSINESS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every day 100 # 000 messages -- all delivered within five minutes -- flow through a single telecommunications network here that handles transactions worth $ 147 billion , an amount larger than the gross_national_product of Denmark . Yet this is not a national system . It is the network of a single company -- Mitsui &amp; Co . -- linking 11 # 000 employees in more_than 200 offices in 88 countries . This is the sogo shosha ( integrated trading company ) , an institution that helped nurture this country into the world ' s leading trader -- as measured by surpluses -- and promises to lead it into an even broader role in international business . &quot; From 1950 to 1970 , with exports as the core , Japan grew by more_than 10 % a year . It was able to do this because of the trading companies . Every three years , they found a new product to drive exports -- bicycles , motorcycles , cameras , radios , television , steel , cars . Manufacturers couldn ' t have done_it alone , &quot; said Eimei Yamashita , a former vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) and a retired Mitsui executive . Trading companies are not unique to Japan . Jardine Matheson of Hong Kong is a trading company . South_Korea mimicked Japan to establish trading companies for each of its chaebol ( conglomerates ) . Even the United States , under Presidents Jimmy_Carter and Ronald Reagan , attempted to create trading companies . But none of the non-Japanese firms ever achieved the size of the shosha . * Blanketing the globe , each of them buys and sells as_many as 30 # 000 products -- so many that top_executives have trouble keeping track of what ' s going_on at their own companies . Mitsui , for example , formerly divided its operations into product-line divisions . &quot; But when the number of divisions reached 80 , it became apparent we were losing sight of the overall picture , &quot; company President Naohiko Kumagai told the newspaper Asahi . The divisions were reorganized into 20 headquarters &quot; to broaden horizontal contacts , &quot; he said . Although 19 firms belong_to the Japan Foreign Trade Council , five behemoths and four giants attract most of the attention . Their combined fiscal 1993 sales -- excluding their subsidiaries -- amounted to $ 957 billion , or more_than a quarter of Japan ' s GNP . Beginning around 1970 , Japan ' s major manufacturers started selling their own products overseas , but the Big Nine trading companies still handle 65 % of Japan ' s imports and 37 % of its exports . Now , trading to and from Japan accounts_for only 30 % of the trading giants ' overall business , and the shosha are beginning to serve non-Japanese as well as Japanese clients , tackling new ventures and investing around the world . Mitsui , for example , now lists about 1 # 000 subsidiaries and &quot; affiliated companies. &quot; &quot; It is wrong to think_of the sogo shosha simply as traders , &quot; said Minoru Murofushi , president of Itochu Corp. , the No . 1 trading company . &quot; We are financiers , investors , developers , coordinators and consultants . We are innovators , continually venturing into new areas. &quot; Added Mitsui ' s Kumagai : &quot; The trading company has become a knowledge-intensive service industry. &quot; In addition to traditional fields such_as securing supplies of natural_resources , fish and agricultural goods for Japan and exporting machinery , steel and chemicals , in recent years the shosha have entered the fields of computer software , telecommunications , satellites , real_estate development , oil exploration and media and entertainment . Indeed , nothing seems too big or too offbeat . To bring liquefied natural_gas to Japan , Mitsui , for example , put_together developer consortiums and liquefaction plants in Abu Dhabi and in Australia and purchaser consortiums of electric_power and gas_companies in Japan ; built liquefied natural_gas tankers , and arranged all_of the financing . The Australia project cost $ 19 billion . New facilities under construction at a cost of $ 120 million at the Port of Los Angeles -- to handle 9 million tons a year of steam_coal and petroleum coke for export to Japan , South_Korea and Taiwan -- were financed in part by 11 Japanese trading firms . At the same time , the shosha raise chickens for Kentucky Fried Chicken shops here and supervise box-lunch delivery three times a day to 7-Eleven stores . They also serve as &quot; sensors &quot; for Japan ' s business world -- pinpointing demand for new products , discovering new technology that manufacturers can commercialize and shifting personnel to exploit new markets , Yamashita said . * After the first oil shock in the 1970s , shosha bolstered their staffs in the Middle_East and quickly increased Japanese exports to the region awash in petrodollars . The latest shift in_focus is to China . The largest chunk of business for the average trading company -- 44 % -- comes from wholesaling and business ventures in the domestic market . But the biggest growth segment is third-country trade_in which Japan is neither the exporter nor the importer . A quarter of sales now come from this sector . With the spread of Japanese factories in Asia , for instance , shosha are increasing exports to the United States and Europe of Japanese products made offshore . The U.S. Commerce_Department last year found that Japanese subsidiaries in the United States got 23 % of their imports from third countries , more_than any other nation ' s U.S.-based subsidiaries . And increasingly they also are handling non-Japanese products . Mitsui &amp; Co. , for example , is marketing Du Pont chemicals in the Asia Pacific region ; Unisys computers in Latin_America , Eastern Europe , the Commonwealth of Independent States and Southeast_Asia ; Caterpillar bulldozers in Russia , and General Electric_power plants in Thailand and Indonesia . The steep appreciation of the yen has promoted such alliances . Mitsui serves as General Electric ' s agent in Japan , and its relationship with the U.S. giant dates_back to prewar days . But GE ' s major sales here consisted_of selling the first power_plant of its kind and then turning_over to either Toshiba or Hitachi the manufacture of all subsequent same-model plants , &quot; thus developing the heavy electric machinery industry in Japan , &quot; said Hiroshi Otaka , general_manager of Mitsui ' s electric machinery international division . Beginning around 1965 , Mitsui started exporting power-generating equipment made by Toshiba , one of the 34 Mitsui Group companies . &quot; Japanese products were not that good , but the price was very inexpensive , &quot; Otaka said . &quot; But at an exchange_rate of slightly more_than 100 yen to the dollar , ( Toshiba products ) no longer are competitive. &quot; that ' s why Mitsui is now selling GE products to its Asian customers , he added . GE finds it advantageous to use Mitsui because the trading company pays_for the machinery upfront , assumes the risk of building the power_plants and arranges the financing -- part of which has recently been provided by the export-import banks of both Japan and the United States , Otaka said . Trading companies also are unique in Japan for ranking among the world ' s least profitable businesses . Although figures for turnover are bloated by accounting practices that include the value of products sold -- not just shosha fees -- net_profit has been recently running as low as 0.1 % and 0.2 % of sales , according to Yukio Onuma , manager of Itochu ' s research department . Shosha executives claim they are determined to raise profits , yet they remain committed to activities that American executives would have abandoned long ago . Amano , for example , explained his company ' s dedication to ensuring a steady supply of iron_ore to Japan by declaring that the low-profit business has a &quot; social meaning. &quot; Tolerance of minuscule profits is even more amazing in_view of the risks . A shosha will either buy exports or imports directly from a manufacturer , eliminating any possible loss from foreign_exchange fluctuations , or provide hedges against currency movement . In multibillion-dollar overseas projects , trading companies even hedge risks by entering alliances with their rivals . * But disasters , such_as development by a Mitsui-led consortium of a petrochemical complex in Iran , do occur . Launched in 1971 , the complex was damaged during the Iran-Iraq War and collapsed under political turmoil in Iran . Mitsui , which held a 60 % share , lost nearly $ 2.4 billion ( at the current exchange_rate ) while other Japanese partners saw nearly $ 1.6 billion disappear , a Mitsui spokesman said . Only 20 % of the losses were covered by Japanese government insurance , he added . Perhaps most fundamental to shosha is the intimacy and the history of business_relationships built_up over generations . Mitsui salespeople , for example , visit Tokyo Electric_Power Co . nearly every day and obtain information on all_of the power_company ' s investment and purchase plans , according to Otaka . For Toyota , which needs exporting help perhaps less than any other firm in Japan , Mitsui helps sell products in Canada , Latin_America , Southeast_Asia and Africa . It also is a partner in Toyota production in Colombia and Turkey . The relationship began when Mitsui -- in 1899 -- started acting_as agent to sell an automatic spinning loom invented by Sakichi Toyoda , whose son was later to found Toyota Motor Co . That contract , which lifted the invention from obscurity , is still remembered by executives of both companies .
