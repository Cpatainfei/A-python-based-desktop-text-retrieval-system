   <TEXT> According to accounts reaching Washington in the late 1980s , the Central_Intelligence_Agency station in Jamaica was a menagerie of misfits , incompetents and twisted personalities -- an overstaffed way station for time-servers no one else wanted . The deputy station chief reportedly assaulted his wife repeatedly , once throttling her until she passed_out . Another agent was cited for getting drunk in a hotel bar and screaming out her rage against the CIA . A third allegedly threatened to kill his own security_guards . These sordid details leap_out of a sex-discrimination lawsuit filed_in August by the CIA agent -- the first female chief of station in Latin_America -- assigned to clean_up the Jamaica operation . The agency , declining to comment while her suit is pending , has neither confirmed nor challenged her account . The officer , known in court documents as Jane Doe Thompson but identified by numerous sources as Janine M . Brookner , arrived in the Jamaican_capital of Kingston in 1989 with a sterling reputation for prowess as a spy and for personal probity . She immediately began to try to assert control over the mess she inherited . She tried counseling her wayward charges , wrote warnings into their performance appraisals and finally reported them to CIA headquarters in Langley , Va . What happened next shocked most who had known Brookner , 53 , during her stainless 21-year career at the CIA . In what her backers described as a bureaucratic covert_operation , the spies of the Jamaica station turned the tables on their boss , demanding that she be investigated by the CIA ' s inspector_general . They portrayed her as a drunk and a sexpot . They accused her of cheating on her overtime slips and of misusing a CIA helicopter assigned to Jamaica for anti-drug operations . Today she is a discredited spy doing make-work in a windowless cubicle at CIA headquarters . While the courts will ultimately decide the merits of the Brookner case , the episode has raised a larger question of whether the CIA , as she charges , is marked by a &quot; pervasive atmosphere of machismo and sexual discrimination. &quot; Interviews with current and former CIA officials suggest there is substantiation for Brookner ' s claim that the Directorate of Operations , the true heart of the CIA , is a male-run enclave whose very secrecy has insulated it from the larger society it is meant to serve . Critics charge that the agency indulges and promotes hard-drinking , skirt-chasing male agents . They cite the case of convicted traitor Aldrich H . Ames , who was promoted into sensitive positions despite being -- by his own description -- a &quot; falling-down drunk. &quot; The officials say Brookner ' s case is surprising only because she rose so high and fell so hard , and that scores of other women have been methodically thwarted in their efforts to rise through agency ranks . Lawyers representing female clandestine service officers are threatening a class-action lawsuit accusing the agency of systematic discrimination . Rod Boggs of the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights said there is an egregious pattern of gender bias at the CIA . &quot; I ' ve been doing these kinds of cases -- both in government and private industry -- for more_than 20 years , and I ' ve never seen such clear-cut evidence of discrimination , &quot; Boggs said . But the case has narrowed from several hundred potential plaintiffs to about 50 or 60 female officers , not all_of whom are willing to go public with their complaints for fear of retaliation . Observers inside and outside the agency say they expect the action to be settled before it reaches court . CIA officials deny that sexual_harassment and discrimination are rampant at the agency and are part of its culture . Yet the CIA ' s own classified &quot; glass-ceiling study &quot; conducted in 1991 found almost 50 % of female officers said they had been sexually harassed . Most said they had not reported the incidents to male superiors because they believed to do so would be career suicide . The study described the CIA as an &quot; adverse work environment &quot; for women and said reprisals against women &quot; seem to go unchecked. &quot; In her suit , Brookner said she had been subjected_to unwanted sexual advances from male bosses in virtually every assignment she held_in the United States and abroad . The Brookner and Ames cases also opened a window on another bit of agency dirty laundry -- endemic alcohol_abuse , particularly at the CIA ' s foreign stations . Current and former officials -- some very senior -- say heavy drinking has been tolerated , even when it threatens security and operations , in a frat-house culture that appears to condone virtually any offense except snitching on colleagues . Even when a pattern of alcohol_abuse is widely known , as it was in Ames ' case , the agency appears loath to move against one of its own . It worries about the effect on morale and fears that disciplinary action could push a spiteful officer over to the other side . What emerges from court documents and interviews with numerous CIA officials is a portrait of ordinary people with ordinary vices operating under extraordinary secrecy and duress . Often living under cover and forced to conceal their identities even from their own children , CIA officers tend to socialize among themselves in a protective cocoon . They drink as part of their work of recruiting foreign spies and to relieve the stress , isolation and tedium of their jobs . The court papers and interviews also depict a climate of frequent debauchery and unchecked libido , protected by a cult and culture of secrecy and the largely unaccountable power of foreign station chiefs and senior barons at CIA headquarters . Women are viewed by many as a hindrance or , at best , an operational tool to lure potential agents into spying for the CIA . &quot; It ' s more fraternal than machismo in the Directorate of Operations , &quot; a former senior CIA official said . &quot; It ' s a circle-the-wagons culture spurred on by elitism . They are very supportive of one another because they see themselves as the centurions , the guardians , and their task is difficult and not readily understood by anyone else. &quot; Added another former top agency official : &quot; It ' s an organization with a sense of mission , like the carrier pilot fraternity . The idea that a woman could do this diminishes the thing . It ' s all about the male ego. &quot; Director of Central Intelligence R . James Woolsey asserted in an interview that he was determined to change this culture , although he admitted it was at least a five- to 10-year task . &quot; I am committed to making any changes I need to in_order to ensure that the D.O. ( Directorate of Operations , as the clandestine service is known ) is not a white male fraternity . Not only is it unjust to be a white male fraternity , it is ineffective , &quot; Woolsey said . &quot; It is excellent for the D.O. to have a spirit of camaraderie , the way a good military_unit does , where people take_care of one another . ( But ) it is also important that in doing so , they deal with one another ' s shortcomings in a fair and disciplined way , as was not done_in the Ames case. &quot; The sexism and the tolerance for heavy drinking and incompetence that Woolsey vowed to change have led to incidents such_as these : * At least two of the current top operations directorate chiefs have had sexual affairs with subordinates , the Brookner suit alleges . One of them was discovered in flagrante delicto with a female employee on the couch in his office at CIA headquarters . * Edward Lee Howard , who later became a spy for the KGB , went_to the CIA ' s medical services office in 1981 for counseling because he believed he had a serious drinking problem . The counselor dismissed his concern . &quot; I ' ve got people who sit in the parking_lot at headquarters , drinking , &quot; the adviser said , according to David Wise ' s book on the Howard case , &quot; The Spy Who Got Away. &quot; &quot; I ' ve got one lady who filled her windshield_wiper dispenser with vodka and rigged the line so the hose comes inside the car . When she ' s caught in traffic , she can turn_on the wipers and squirt herself , &quot; the counselor said , telling Howard to &quot; settle_down &quot; and come_back if his drinking got_worse . * The CIA station chief in Taiwan some years ago became enamored of the wife of one of his junior officers . To facilitate his seduction of the woman , he repeatedly sent the husband on extended and dangerous out-of-town assignments . The marriage eventually dissolved and the station chief married the woman , according to a former CIA officer who served in the region at the time . * In another sexual-harassment complaint against the agency , a CIA secretary said her career was ruined after she rebuffed the attentions of the station chief where she was posted . She applied for another foreign job but was told that she was &quot; too attractive &quot; to be sent to that post . Later she was informed that there was a &quot; psychological / medical &quot; hold_on future assignments because of her earlier complaint , which revealed her to be too &quot; headstrong &quot; to merit promotion . The woman ' s attorney , Pamela B . Stuart , said it was &quot; inconceivable that a man would be denied an overseas job because of his looks &quot; and alleged that her client was a victim of &quot; bureaucratic psycho-terrorism. &quot; * In an episode alleged in the Brookner case , a female CIA case officer in Jamaica suffered repeated bouts of depression and binge drinking after her numerous failed affairs , including one with a married Drug Enforcement Administration official based on the island . The woman , referred to in court documents only as &quot; Rachel , &quot; got roaring drunk at a public bar at the Wyndham Hotel in Kingston at a January , 1990 , party for U.S. Embassy , CIA and Secret_Service officials . Rachel reportedly revealed to all within earshot that she worked for the CIA and endangered the cover of several other undercover officers attending the party . * The Brookner suit also tells of a drunk senior operations directorate executive falling_over a coffee_table while lunging for a female guest at a party in Caracas , Venezuela ; of a former chief of clandestine_operations who got so plastered during a meeting with foreign intelligence officials that he could not remember whether he had revealed sensitive internal information to them ; of a top overseas agent nicknamed the &quot; afternoon chief of station &quot; because most mornings he was too hung over to show_up for work . Agency defenders say the days of heavy boozing and womanizing are past and point to the rising numbers of women in the clandestine service and throughout the agency . Overall , 42 % of CIA employees are women ; 38 % of workers classified as professionals are women . Woolsey noted that six of the 13 senior CIA officials who report directly to him are women , including the general counsel , the comptroller , the head of the equal_opportunity office , the head of congressional affairs and the director of the National Intelligence Council . But none of the four substantive baronies of the CIA -- the directorates of operations , intelligence analysis , administration and science and technology -- has ever been run_by a woman . And only the administration directorate has a woman as its No . 2 official . There has been a marked increase in the assignment of female spies overseas in recent years , according to CIA statistics . As of last month , 30 % of clandestine officers overseas and 20 % of station chiefs were women . The first female chief of station was not named until 1979 . But women still are a rarity at the executive level . Only 12 % of the top officers -- the Senior Intelligence Service -- are women , and no woman has ever reached the No . 2 spot in the operations directorate . Brookner might have been_on her way to breaking that glass ceiling had the questionable charges that sank her career not arisen . She was slated to be chief of station in Prague , beginning this summer , which might have led to a bigger European station and eventually to a top job at Langley . Instead , she was brought_down by allegations that might be laughable had the CIA not taken them so seriously . Brookner was accused of drunkenness by subordinate officers she had disciplined for intemperate public drinking . She was described as a &quot; sexual provocateur &quot; by two officers who said that while she never actually touched them , she gave the impression that she &quot; might make a pass. &quot; She was cited for wearing &quot; brief shorts and thin T-shirts with . . . no perceptible or very skimpy underwear &quot; -- in her own home_in a tropical climate . She was accused of lying on her overtime sheets -- to the tune of $ 150.96 over several years . Numerous witnesses -- including many of Brookner ' s former CIA bosses , several ambassadors with whom she worked ( including former U.N. Ambassador Jeane J . Kirkpatrick ) , her ex-husband and her son -- have said the charges against Brookner were ludicrous and utterly inconsistent with her reputation for sobriety , rectitude and personal modesty . Some said the charge that she wore provocative clothing was especially surprising because she has a long scar from open-heart_surgery and self-consciously dresses to conceal it . Either those witnesses were not interviewed by the CIA ' s inspector_general or their testimony was ignored in his final , devastating report . An agency official said it was standing policy to include relevant favorable comments in such reports and noted , &quot; I know of no exceptions. &quot; How , then , to account_for Brookner ' s fate ? A senior CIA official said the suit exaggerated her abilities and suggested that , even without the allegations , she was not destined for a high-level post . He hinted that there were other factors , classified and confidential , in her record that would disqualify her . Absurd , replied Brookner ' s lawyer , Victoria Toensing , formerly chief counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Justice_Department ' s top counterterrorism official . Brookner ' s downfall can be attributed to a conspiracy by vicious subordinates she had disciplined and to a culture receptive to charges against women , said Toensing , now a Washington attorney with the Los Angeles-based firm of Manatt , Phelps &amp; Phillips . &quot; This is how they treat a turncoat , &quot; said Toensing , who generally has supported the agency in the past . &quot; They were trying to teach her a lesson. &quot; She said Brookner ' s accusers were schooled in the arts of intrigue , treachery and deception , and used them all to destroy her . &quot; These are people who believe that women can be tools or weapons , but they cannot be colleagues , &quot; Toensing said . All of this is mildly amusing to Eloise Randolph Page , the CIA ' s pioneer female operative , now retired after more_than 40 years in the spy trade -- dating_back to the wartime Office of Strategic Services . She said proudly that she was the &quot; first woman everything &quot; -- branch chief , division chief , station chief . But , Page said , most of the current women at the agency who complain that they have been denied promotions probably did not deserve them . She contended that the agency has gone &quot; too far too fast &quot; in trying to integrate women into the covert_operations branch . &quot; Frankly , &quot; Page said , &quot; there weren ' t that many women capable of being case officers or running operations . They sent women where they shouldn ' t have been , so they didn ' t perform all that well. &quot; Yet , by her own description , Page ' s career path was potholed by sex discrimination at every turn . She asserted that sexism in the operations directorate was &quot; endemic and part of the culture. &quot; When Page was first considered for the position of chief of station , in Oslo in the early 1970s , then-Deputy Director for Operations Archie Roosevelt vetoed the promotion , saying he would never have a female station chief . She was later offered two window-dressing posts -- station chief in Canberra and in London . She turned them down because the United States did not run operations against Australia or Britain . &quot; I was not going_to be exploited , &quot; Page said . &quot; I was not going_to be a token. &quot; In 1979 , Chief of Operations John McMahon decided to appoint her chief of station in Athens , a key post earlier held by Richard Welch , who was assassinated by leftists in 1975 , and Clair E . George , who later became operations director until he retired in the backwash of the Iran-Contra scandal . More_than 30 years after the founding of the CIA , the agency was to have its first female chief of station . &quot; When McMahon announced it , at the end of a list of 15 senior appointments , you could have heard a Kleenex drop_in that room . It was unbelievable , &quot; Page recalled . &quot; Half of the men walked over to congratulate me . And half of the men walked_out_of the room without saying a word. &quot;</TEXT>
