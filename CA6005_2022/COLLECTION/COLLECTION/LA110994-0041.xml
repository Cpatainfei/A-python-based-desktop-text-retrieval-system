   <HEADLINE> FILMMAKERS SEE FUTURE : SCIENCE_FICTION ; LESS EXPENSIVE EFFECTS , END OF CENTURY HAVE HOLLYWOOD REVISITING AN OLD GENRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They ' re ba-aaack ! Science-fiction movies , of the big-budget / big-effects variety , are , like Westerns , suddenly back in the saddle . Even before &quot; Stargate ' s &quot; record-breaking debut weekend in late October and even more stunning second weekend at No . 1 , there were three times as_many sci-fi movies as Westerns in production . What &quot; Dances With Wolves &quot; and &quot; Unforgiven &quot; were to Westerns , &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; &quot; Stargate &quot; and the ongoing &quot; Star Trek &quot; franchise may be to science_fiction . &quot; ' Stargate ' filled a void for science-fiction effects we hadn ' t seen in a while , &quot; notes movie analyst David Davis of Paul Kagan Associates . &quot; But I think what will really bring_back the science-fiction genre is when George Lucas makes the next three ' Star Wars ' movies. &quot; Lucas -- whose in-development &quot; Star Wars : The Clone Wars &quot; is planned as the first of three &quot; Star Wars &quot; prequels to be filmed back-to-back -- is far from the only movie heavyweight with a future in science_fiction . The seventh &quot; Star Trek &quot; feature_film is_due Nov . 18 and represents a passing of the torch from the original TV series cast to that of &quot; The Next Generation &quot; -- and presumably future generations of sequels in the popular franchise . * Kevin Costner is producing and starring in Universal ' s &quot; Waterworld , &quot; a post-apocalyptic underwater &quot; Road Warrior &quot; that , at an estimated $ 135-million budget or more , may be the most expensive movie ever made . Keanu Reeves has finished shooting TriStar ' s &quot; Johnny Mnemonic , &quot; with a script written by cyber-punk bestseller William Gibson . James Cameron has produced and co-written the just-wrapped Fox film &quot; Strange Days , &quot; starring Ralph Fiennes , Angela Bassett , Juliette Lewis and Vincent D ' Onofrio . Oliver Stone is working_on a &quot; Planet of the Apes &quot; picture , and Stanley Kubrick on a film about artificial_intelligence . Tom Hanks is reportedly attached_to Robert Heinlein ' s &quot; Stranger in a Strange Land , &quot; now in development at Paramount . Why sci-fi , and why now ? Partly , it ' s because Hollywood feeds_on itself . &quot; Everybody jokes that there are only eight development people in Hollywood , &quot; says Paul Colichman , the media-division president of independent studio IRS , which has a half-dozen science-fiction movies in the pipeline . &quot; And everybody knows everybody in Hollywood , and they think along the same lines -- that ' s why there were three ' Robin_Hoods ' ( in production simultaneously four years ago ) . You ' ll see these spurts in the Hollywood community. &quot; Science_fiction is , indeed , cyclical . In the 1930s , there were Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers serials . In the ' 40s , there was essentially nothing . The ' 50s brought a stream of Atomic Age movies , both serious ( &quot; The Day the Earth Stood Still &quot; ) and frivolous ( &quot; Attack of the 50 Ft . Woman &quot; ) . The 1960s were barren , except for the occasional &quot; Fantastic Journey &quot; or &quot; 2001 : A Space Odyssey. &quot; Then the late ' 70s exploded with &quot; Star Wars &quot; and its countless imitators . Yet after the early 1980s , science_fiction stopped being called that in the theatrical market ( although remaining popular in the direct-to-video market ) . Generally , sci-fi movies like &quot; The Terminator &quot; and &quot; The Road Warrior &quot; are stocked in the action-adventure section of video stores , and &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; with its cloned dinosaurs , is still considered a &quot; family adventure film. &quot; Even &quot; Stargate &quot; producer Mario Kassar demurs when it comes_to the term . &quot; I know everybody ' s calling it science_fiction , &quot; he says of his film , &quot; but I look_at it as just a unique drama. &quot; &quot; People are afraid that calling a movie ' science_fiction ' may limit its audience to a fringe group , &quot; observes veteran science-fiction producer Pen Densham , who with John Watson and Richard B . Lewis produced MGM ' s just-wrapped &quot; Tank Girl , &quot; and is launching a new &quot; Outer Limits &quot; series on Showtime . &quot; It ' s like politics , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s putting a spin on the product so that people think_of it as a general-audience film . Yet some of our greatest movie experiences have been science_fiction . ' E.T. ' is absolutely science fiction. &quot; Colichman says major studios have avoided the science-fiction label for fear of attracting only sci-fi fans . The big studios want big audiences , and &quot; the mass audience wants ( expensive ) state-of-the-art computer and other effects that will blow their minds , &quot; he says . Colichman , conversely , can produce low-tech sci-fi movies for a smaller audience , since &quot; the aficionados , who are more into science-fiction philosophy and ideals , don ' t demand of me those kinds of expensive special effects. &quot; * With the costs of special_effects coming_down , thanks to new computer animation software and editing systems , the risks of making science-fiction movies will diminish . This helped &quot; Stargate &quot; get made , says its director , Roland Emmerich . &quot; We could do things we couldn ' t do a_couple_of years ago , &quot; he says , &quot; because computer effects helped us to reduce cost. &quot; Yet there appears to be something else feeding this trend as well : the coming of the millennium . &quot; We ' re going toward it like a boat toward the Niagara Falls , &quot; says Densham . &quot; We ' re on a time stream , and we don ' t know what ' s on the other side . I think there ' s a tremendous curiosity now to try and get a vision of our future. &quot; Michael Weldon , a genre-movie specialist and editor of the magazine Psychotronic , agrees . &quot; Science_fiction never went_away , &quot; he says , &quot; but this new interest in it I think has something to do with the end of the century coming_up , and people wondering what ' s next for us. &quot; Will it be the bleak future of Isaac Asimov ' s &quot; Foundation &quot; books , now in development at TriStar with a script by playwright David Henry Hwang ? Will it have a techno-cool industrial look , as in Kassar ' s planned &quot; Total Recall II &quot; ? Or will we look_back to the future , with director Renny Harlin ' s remake of &quot; The Day the Earth Caught Fire &quot; ? &quot; We ' re at the beginning of a cycle , &quot; Densham says . &quot; And whether you ' re talking_about making the movies or just living life , we ' re going through a renaissance and rediscovery of what we can do . It ' s truly becoming what the mind can conceive , the eye can believe. &quot;</TEXT>
