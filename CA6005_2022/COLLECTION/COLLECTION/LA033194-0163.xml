   <HEADLINE> NORTHWEST GROUP ISSUES QUIET CALL FOR LEGALIZED ASSISTED SUICIDE ; COMPASSION IN DYING OFFERS COUNSELING FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL WHO WANT TO END THEIR LIVES . IT IS ALSO SEEKING COURT ACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jack Kevorkian is not alone . Here in the Northwest , quietly , without television_cameras or heated public rallies -- and so far without interference from authorities -- determined activists are helping extend the frontiers of assisted suicide for the terminally ill . Compassion in Dying is the name the group of 25 volunteers and 1 # 400 financial backers has given itself . And so far it has lent encouragement , counsel and support to dozens of men and women who sought help in ending their lives in the final stages of disease . Maybe more significantly , the group is proceeding with court action asking a federal judge to declare a constitutional right for Americans to hasten their inevitable deaths . &quot; Things are changing in the country , &quot; said Susan J . Dunshee , board president of the group . &quot; More and more people know someone who is terminally ill . Pretty soon , almost everybody is going_to know someone who has AIDS . There is more about end-of-life issues on television . More books on the subject . More in the newspapers . It ' s not the same anymore. &quot; Indeed , while suicide remains stigmatized and assisting in suicides is unlawful in more_than half of the states , it is an everyday fact of life across much of the nation . But it occurs in a forbidden zone of American culture -- with knowing but uninvolved doctors , amateur how-to guidebooks , AIDS- or cancer-support groups , perhaps a loving partner or family member . Or worse , it occurs violently , with a gunshot or a car wreck . Lacking is public acceptance . And uniform standards , reliable guidance , medical recognition and a solemn process or ritual . Members of Compassion in Dying say they find this a cruel indignity for people who have suffered greatly . And so the group has stepped into the legal &quot; gray zone , &quot; willing to help the dying -- up_to a point -- and simultaneously nudging society toward lifting this taboo . So , what does Compassion in Dying actually do ? Dunshee says the organization will only assist adults whose doctors attest that they have a terminal illness and less than six months to live . Patients are screened for mental competence and to make_sure that no close friend or relative will object to suicide counseling . At that point , it is up_to the dying patient to procure enough barbiturates from a physician to enable suicide . In this regard , Compassion in Dying is different from Kevorkian , the former physician in Michigan who has provided the means for suicide . Also , Kevorkian has not limited his assistance to people with less than six months to live . Kathryn L . Tucker , an attorney who advises Compassion in Dying , says the process by which a patient must obtain suicide dosages of drugs is unsatisfactory . She described a typical encounter between doctor and patient : Patient : I ' m having a terrible time sleeping . Doctor : OK , I ' ll give you a prescription . But don ' t take more_than &quot; X &quot; because it will kill you . &quot; They talk in that kind of code . They don ' t have direct communication . There is no opportunity for doctors to consult one another like they do on everything else . Yet these are people who critically need medical advice , &quot; Tucker said . With that dialogue lacking , Compassion in Dying will counsel patients about dosages , how to mix the barbiturates with soft food , about anti-nausea treatment and how to follow up the mixture with a shot of whiskey . In all cases , the organization says the patient must self-administer the drugs . Sleep follows in minutes , death within hours . &quot; It ' s a tragedy for people who think they know how to do this and then botch it , &quot; Dunshee said . She also said it is a &quot; tragedy &quot; that a good many patients turn_to their doctors and are refused barbiturate prescriptions in sufficient quantities . About half of the terminally ill who contact the group have cancer , closely followed by AIDS and , a distant third , emphysema . Dunshee said several hundred ill people have made contact with the group and about 30 have followed_through with the organization until their deaths , either by suicide or from the effects of disease before a suicide could be undertaken . By reaching_out to Compassion in Dying , patients and families are seeking more_than just guidance . They are grasping for social validity for the decision to end a life . Some ask_for more . They seek spiritual counseling . Ralph Mero , executive_director of the group , is an ordained minister -- and the organization calls_upon a network of volunteer clergy from many religious denominations . Some patients ask that Compassion in Dying volunteers be at their bedsides at the end . The organization honors these requests , although it is vague about how many suicides its volunteers have attended -- probably fewer than 10 . &quot; This makes_it possible for some people to die in their own beds with dignity . Nobody should have to die alone , &quot; Dunshee said . To avoid legal problems , Dunshee won ' t directly acknowledge witnessing a suicide . She will say only that she has been_on hand when a person died at the time of_his_own choosing . &quot; I had the sense that this was the best possible death . A person is conscious before dying , surrounded by loved ones , in his own bed with his favorite music. &quot; When asked , the Roman_Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle and well-known right-to-life organizations in the state will denounce Compassion in Dying . But so far , the backlash has been temperate . The practice of assisting in suicides is more widespread than some might think . Less than a year ago , the 145 # 000-member National Assn . of Social_Workers issued guidelines saying it is &quot; not inappropriate for a social_worker &quot; to be present at a suicide . Crusader Derek Humphry ' s book on the subject , &quot; Final Exit , &quot; has sold more_than 700 # 000 copies . Tom Preston , a Seattle cardiologist and advisory_board member to Compassion in Dying , guesses that between 30 % and 50 % of the doctors he knows would be willing to prescribe barbiturates for terminally ill patients . He has long advocated revising medical standards to help people avoid terrible suffering just before death . &quot; At the end of life , there is a clash between the two callings of medicine -- prolonging life and easing suffering . Today there are too many physicians using curative methods for people who are dying . These are intrusive , painful and cause distress . Part of the role of the physician is to help people die , &quot; Preston said . Compassion in Dying is an outgrowth of a 1991 Washington state ballot proposition that sought to legalize physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill , mentally competent adults . The measure was favored in pre-election polls but went_down to defeat after opponents mounted a campaign suggesting that physicians would become killers . A similar proposition was defeated in California in November , 1992 . In the aftermath of those defeats , organizers in Seattle decided to make their next big push in the federal_courts . Like many states , Washington has a law making_it a crime to assist or cause a suicide . In a lawsuit argued recently in U.S. District Court here , Compassion in Dying and a string of supporters argued that such laws violate the Constitution the same way that anti-abortion statutes do . &quot; People , &quot; Tucker said , &quot; have basic rights over their lives and bodies. &quot; Their Terms for Helping Under the self-imposed guidelines , Compassion in Dying offers suicide counseling and support only to individuals in sound mental condition and have less than six months to live . Certain diseases tend to fall_under the guidelines and others do not . Here is a sample comparison .
