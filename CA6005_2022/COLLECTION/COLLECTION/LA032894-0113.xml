   <TEXT> Few visitors were ever allowed into Alexander Ilyin ' s ramshackle house in this wheat-country town . When he died , people found_out why . Ilyin had been a familiar scruffy figure around here , an electrician for local cafeterias . With his long face and burning eyes , he resembled a scrawny vampire ; in his ancient shoes and shabby coat , he could pass for a bum . The eyes gave him away . He was a man with an illicit passion burning so strong that nothing -- not the KGB , not the criminal underworld , not the bonds of Soviet ideology -- could stand_in its way . After he died last fall at 73 , local officials invaded Ilyin ' s home with an order to freeze his property until his rightful heirs could be determined . They had suspicions about what they would find ; everyone in town knew Ilyin was a collector . But they had never imagined the magnitude of the treasure he left , a monument to the peculiar ingenuity of a true collector who could overcome anything -- even the repression of a Communist police_state that frowned_on private_property -- to amass his hoard . Ilyin had done the seemingly impossible . He had accumulated an entire museum -- tens of thousands of rare books along with gold- and silver-framed icons , paintings and antiques -- under the Soviet regime . His cache included 16th-Century books believed to be published by the Russian Gutenberg -- Ivan Fyodorov -- and tome after leather-bound tome of valuable manuscripts . The Soviet_Union had no equivalent of Sotheby ' s auction_house , but some of Ilyin ' s methods of procurement can be guessed . He bought valuables at bargain-basement prices from fallen noble families and needy pensioners , victims of revolution , war and poverty . He swapped with less knowledgeable colleagues . According to many , he also corrupted library and museum officials to obtain choice objets , and may have had dealings with criminals . Kirovograd residents shake their heads in bewildered wonder at the size of his collection . &quot; He was a collector of the highest order , &quot; said librarian Alexander Chudnov , an Ilyin protege who is helping to catalogue the hoard . &quot; People often compare the love of books to the love of women -- he knew value and to some extent it was love that turned_into lust , into a ' This is mine ! ' &quot; Ilyin ' s home and an annex on the half-acre lot had no plumbing or central_heating , like most houses in the Ukrainian countryside . But officials found both to be stuffed with the density of a moving van . Ancient books teetered in floor-to-ceiling piles , some rotting in the damp and nibbled by mice . Ilyin ' s niece , Irina Podtyolkova , and her husband lived with the collector and objected furiously to the state intervention . But this was bigger than both of them . &quot; It was like coming_into a cave , &quot; said Oxana Nelga , a librarian who helped pack up and list the Ilyin collection . &quot; First the fear , then the surprise of finding silver wrapped in rags. &quot; The treasures of the Ilyin household created a sensation . The local press , quoting an overly enthusiastic official , claimed that the books and other valuables were worth a far-fetched $ 40 billion , more_than the Ukrainian state budget_for the last several years . Their actual value is uncertain . Rare Russian book collections sold for millions of rubles back when that would have been millions of dollars , said Alexandra Guseva of the rare books section of Moscow ' s Lenin Library . But Harry Leich , Russian specialist at the U.S. Library of Congress , said there seems to be little market for them now . Nonetheless , &quot; I would not underestimate the cultural value of it , &quot; Leich said , noting that the discovery of an extensive private Russian collection is &quot; a major event culturally and historically . Because of the vicissitudes of history , there aren ' t many of them around. &quot; Ilyin ' s collection , which local museum director Pavel Bosiy valued at several million dollars , is not all catalogued yet , and the authenticity of some of the rarest books must be checked . But officials at the Kirovograd museum , which serves the province ' s population of 1.5 million , figure that Ilyin ' s collection outstrips theirs . Some see Ilyin as a looter who exploited his country ' s misfortunes . Others view him as a visionary . His collection reflects some of the tremendous distortion of_values under Soviet Communist dogma , a distortion that is only beginning to be set right as Russia reclaims its history . The Bolsheviks slaughtered priests , tore_down churches and persecuted believers . They saw little value in icons , the Byzantine-style portraits of saints typically painted on wood and framed with gold and silver . During the Stalin era , Ilyin had seen local museum workers destroy icons with an ax , pulling_away the silver frames and then chopping the wood to be burned for heating , said Ivan Anastasiev , a fellow collector in Kirovograd . But those with clear sight cherished them . Westerners have long smuggled icons out of Russia , and Ilyin was gathering them even when Soviet citizens could be hounded for having them . &quot; God knows how , but he gathered and kept what could have disappeared , &quot; Anastasiev said . &quot; It ' s a great feat that it ' s still here. &quot; The Bolsheviks also frowned_upon everything that smacked of the highfalutin world of the aristocracy they had ousted . When rebellious peasants sacked the family estates of noble clans , the spoils could often be bought for a song . &quot; The logic of the regime was that everything before 1917 was lies , &quot; said Valery Repalo , head of the state commission on the Ilyin collection . &quot; Only that which related to the Soviet epoch had value. &quot; Ilyin loved the Baroque and Rococo styles of pre-revolutionary Russia . His collection included magnificent books such_as &quot; The Byzantine Enamels &quot; -- which cost 12 # 000 silver pieces in 1892 -- and &quot; The Great Princes and Czars Hunting in Russia , &quot; gorgeous coffee-table-size editions printed at 200 or so copies with brilliant illustrations . The Communists hated the czars . Ilyin bought their portraits , one of them apparently done_by the renowned painter Dmitri Levitsky , who died in the early 19th Century . Ilyin had taste , but there was an unsavory side to his collecting . He was , as one librarian said , &quot; no angel. &quot; Collecting &quot; is a passion that swallows everything , &quot; Anastasiev said . &quot; When a person will do anything , including criminal acts , to get things. &quot; Communism made property collective -- and therefore no one ' s . Stealing from the state was considered a minor peccadillo ; that meant that museum and library workers could be easily persuaded to make an unprofitable swap or to purloin a book from dusty shelves . &quot; You could take an icon from a museum for a bottle of vodka if you were in cahoots with the director , &quot; said Pavel Bosiy , now head of the local museum . Some of Ilyin ' s books have library stamps in them , cataloguers said . And how are they to explain Ilyin ' s possession of the very Bible that the Empress Yelizaveta bestowed upon their city back when it was called Yelizavetgrad ? And there are rumors about the World_War_II years . Some say Ilyin was one of the carpetbaggers who , during the 900-day siege of Leningrad , traded bread to ravenous residents for their heirlooms . Podtyolkova , his niece , angrily denied the rumors , saying Ilyin never even served in Leningrad . But the war did turn the country upside down , with museums evacuated eastward away from the invading Nazis and new treasures flooding_in with the victorious Soviet troops . Museums did not begin normal postwar inventories until 1948 , Bosiy said . Ilyin may or may_not have taken_advantage of his country ' s chaos . What he definitely exploited was the Communist ideal of equality that left everyone equally poor . &quot; Back when pensions were 12 rubles a month &quot; -- then about $ 20 -- &quot; an old_lady would let you take an icon with silver and enamel and jewels for 30 rubles . People needed every penny , &quot; Anastasiev recalled . Ilyin , Chudnov said , had been described as &quot; a python person . He ' d choose a victim who he knew had something , then he ' d circle_around them and sometimes if he couldn ' t get close he ' d just wait . . . . And when the person died , he ' d pounce. &quot; One of the main mysteries about Ilyin is that he lived as a poor_man , eating for free in the cafeterias where he worked and wearing the uniforms provided on_the_job . He never married -- probably , Anastasiev said , because he was too cheap to spend money on a family when the cash could have furthered his collection . And there are greater mysteries . The Soviet regime frowned_upon private book collecting -- as it did on any wheeling and dealing -- and confiscated many of the country ' s best private collections . How did Ilyin survive untouched -- especially when , some accounts say , his collection included coins and medals , which tended to draw the interest of the KGB and the criminal world ? Podtyolkova said that Ilyin had been robbed only once and that the thieves had soon been caught . She speculated that he had been otherwise untouched by the KGB and the underworld because her father -- Ilyin ' s brother-in-law -- was a highly placed prosecutor . Local reporters have other theories . Perhaps , they say , Ilyin was what the Russian underworld knows as a &quot; thief in the law , &quot; a criminal leader whose treasure was actually an obschak -- a general pot , the repository of the goods a gang has accumulated . Chudnov has found documents showing that Ilyin spent time in jail , and there is also a period of 14 years in his life unaccounted for in his work records . Podtyolkova denied that Ilyin had ever served time , but Chudnov believes that gap could mean Ilyin was either in a labor camp or perhaps working for the Russian Orthodox Church , which led something of a life apart from the Soviet state and might not have appeared in his records . The Kirovograd KGB has answered museum officials ' queries about Ilyin with a blank wall , responding only that it has no information on him . The biggest remaining mystery is how Ilyin could allow his treasures to molder in the freezing damp of winter and the humid heat of summer . Museum workers said some of the books were so filthy and moldy that they had to wear respirators while examining them . &quot; He ' s a person we don ' t understand because we can ' t say he didn ' t know they were valuable -- but still they were kept_in such bad_condition , &quot; commission head Repalo said . &quot; He was an egotist. &quot; Chudnov saw Ilyin more as a sadist , saying that the collector ' s passion was twisted enough that he believed that he could do anything he wanted with his own books . &quot; He was a very complex person -- probably in world literature there ' s no parallel , &quot; museum director Bosiy said . &quot; He was a believer , but he took things from churches . He restored books , but he allowed many to be destroyed . He put contemporary pictures in old books. &quot; Museum and Kirovograd officials use Ilyin ' s ill treatment of his treasures as the moral basis for moving_in_on them . They base their claims on a law requiring that collections of unique historical items must be registered , and Ilyin never registered his . Technically , they have only confiscated the collection for six months because Ilyin left no will . But Podtyolkova is sure that she will never see most of it again . She spoke in the cluttered kitchen of Ilyin ' s house , which still smacks visitors with a waft of something rotting as they walk in . It is also still overflowing with books , apparently only the least valuable , even after officials trucked away 500 giant sackfuls . Podtyolkova verged repeatedly on tears as she described how police had invaded her home_in early January despite her protests . They ripped_up the floorboards and used metal detectors to check for last bits of loot , she said . Museum officials say things known to belong_to Ilyin had begun to turn_up on the market , implying that his niece had begun selling items without having clear title . Podtyolkova , who had always lived with her eccentric uncle , makes the counter-accusation that museum officials have not registered all they took , so as_to sell the items themselves . &quot; I don ' t believe_in our democracy , &quot; she said . &quot; They may give us some money , but they won ' t return the things . . . . They came and said : ' Oh , you have a spoon by Faberge ? Why , we have only two of those in our museum in Kiev. ' What I want to know is , why can ' t we have a spoon by Faberge ? &quot; Podtyolkova and museum officials are seeking legal help . Podtyolkova said she cannot afford to hire a lawyer from Kiev , and local attorneys have all refused to aid her . All sides expect long court battles . The loss of her would-be inheritance hurts Podtyolkova . Selling just a portion of it would be enough to buy her a new house , she said . In the latest escalation of the fight between family and state , Podtyolkova said Chudnov and others are accusing her of having done her uncle in and have issued an order for his grave to be opened . For now , the collection fills several rooms at the local museum and several more at the Kirovograd library . All are sealed . Bosiy and Chudnov have not even finished counting all they have . Bosiy says the houses held more_than 300 # 000 items , including a silver cup he values at $ 30 # 000 . Chudnov at the library is looking_at everything from bags of tattered Torahs to books from the era of Ivan the Terrible . &quot; This is one truly sacred book , &quot; he said reverently of a tome printed by Ivan Fyodorov in 1575 . &quot; This is like an English speaker holding an original Shakespeare. &quot; He has some of Ilyin ' s passion , it seems , but maintains his is different . &quot; There are bibliophiles , &quot; he said , &quot; and then there are bibliomaniacs. &quot;</TEXT>
