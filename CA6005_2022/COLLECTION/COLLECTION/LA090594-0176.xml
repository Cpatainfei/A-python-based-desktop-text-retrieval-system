   <HEADLINE> THE BURGEONING ART OF HEALING WITH THE HEAD ; MIND / BODY BOOKS ARE BIG BUSINESS . AND IT ' S NOT JUST NEW AGERS WHO ARE LAPPING THEM UP . AGING BOOMERS ARE ALSO OPENING_UP TO THE NOTION THAT ATTITUDE CAN CURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last summer Oprah Winfrey devoted an entire hourlong chat show to a little-known Indian physician named Deepak Chopra and his book , &quot; Ageless Mind , Timeless Body. &quot; In a wide-ranging discussion , Chopra discoursed on Ayurvedic medicine , the mind , the spirit , and prolonging life through meditation , exercise and the elimination of toxic emotions . Oprah sat riveted . Overnight , sales of the book skyrocketed and today have passed the 1-million mark . Cynics chalk Chopra ' s hit up_to what they called &quot; the Oprah factor , &quot; Winfrey ' s ability to sell anything . But a spin_around the bestseller lists these days raises another possibility : that mind / body books like Chopra ' s are big business , not just in fringe New Age outposts but in malls across America as well : * Doubleday has printed 450 # 000 copies of Bill Moyers ' &quot; Healing and the Mind , &quot; the book tie-in to his popular PBS series on mind / body medicine . * Internist Larry Dossey ' s &quot; Healing Words : The Power of Prayer and the Practice_of_Medicine &quot; climbed to No . 10 on the New York Times bestseller list in May . * Former Yale Medical_School surgeon Bernie Siegel ' s 1986 book , &quot; Love , Medicine &amp; Miracles , &quot; reappeared on the list this spring after spending more_than 52 weeks on the bestseller list in the late 1980s and selling more_than a_million copies . &quot; This is a big and growing area , &quot; says Mike Ferrari , a senior buyer for Waldenbooks at the company ' s headquarters in Stamford , Conn . &quot; There ' s a whole group of authors who bridge the New Age and self-help markets. &quot; * Mind / body medicine books explore the relationship between the mind and physical health , the role that the mind may or may_not play in disease and healing . The books are hot for a number of reasons , say those in the publishing industry . Baby_boomers bravely facing old_age and infirmity are looking_for kinder , gentler alternatives to traditional medicine . At the same time , changes in the health-care system are for the first time creating economic incentives to preach prevention . So awash are readers in mind / body books that Consumer Reports Books has seen fit to publish a consumer ' s guide to the field . Ferrari points to Moyers ' top-selling book as &quot; legitimizing the whole_thing . It showed that here ' s a category that ' s worth pursuing in itself. &quot; &quot; There ' s a certain mainstreaming of the New Age movement , &quot; says Barb Burg , Bantam director of publicity . Shows such_as &quot; Oprah &quot; and &quot; 20-20 &quot; have done favorable pieces on mind / body practitioners , she notes , adding of PBS ' s interest in the topic , &quot; that imprimatur is really helping. &quot; Bantam , attempting to capitalize on an emerging market , launched a New Age imprint in the early 1980s . But as the movement has infiltrated the mainstream , the label is often seen as a liability to wider sales . Take , for example , the recent Bantam release , &quot; Women ' s Bodies , Women ' s Wisdom : Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing , &quot; written by holistic physician Christiane Northrup . The book covers herbal medicine , visualization , nutrition , and the effects of thoughts and emotions on disease . &quot; Before , &quot; Burg says , &quot; we would have called it New Age . Now , it ' s a women ' s health book. &quot; Sydny Miner , executive editor of trade paperback books at Simon &amp; Schuster , agrees that the New Age label can harm mind / body books . &quot; People who would n ' t want to consider using a New Age book would use something in psychology and self-help , &quot; she says . * The notion that the mind can influence the body , that thoughts , emotions and beliefs can dramatically affect health stretches at least as far back as the 4th Century BC , when Hippocrates theorized that disease resulted from a disharmony between mind , body and the environment . In the 20th Century , the seminal mind / body work is Herbert Benson ' s 1975 book , &quot; The Relaxation Response. &quot; The Harvard-trained cardiologist explored the links between high_blood_pressure and stress , and experimented with the use of biofeedback to control blood_pressure . His book on the simple technique he called the relaxation response was an instant bestseller . Thirty printings and 3 1 / 2 million copies later , Benson is the founding president of the Harvard-affiliated Mind / Body Medical Institute . &quot; I was told I was throwing_away a brilliant career , &quot; Benson says , recalling comments made by friends and colleagues . &quot; But no , the data were there. &quot; Although his research on the beneficial effects of transcendental meditation gave the TM movement a huge boost , Benson notes that his bigger contribution was in showing how meditation worked and translating it into non-religious , scientific terms . &quot; The market was right for the scientific proof behind ( meditation ) . People were looking_for other ways to achieve these benefits , &quot; he explains , adding : &quot; We are in fact a model for how something alternative became mainstream. &quot; Benson ' s work went beyond providing the hard science behind the mind / body mythology . It showed people how to work the mind / body connections and improve their lives . At bottom , it was a self-help book . &quot; Americans have always been interested in quick_fixes , &quot; says Bill Adler , the literary_agent who sold &quot; The Relaxation Response &quot; to William Morrow and Co . &quot; We ' re the country of the Beverly Hills Diet and Richard Simmons . It ' s interesting that in England , for example , you really can ' t give these books away . They ' re very skeptical of mind / body. &quot; At around the same time that &quot; The Relaxation Response &quot; was published , discoveries that would lead to the new field of psychoneuroimmunology ( PNI ) , the study of the mind ' s effect on the immune_system , were taking_place , and the mind / body field was heating_up . Kenneth Pelletier ' s landmark &quot; Mind as Healer Mind as Slayer : A Holistic Approach to Preventing Stress Disorders &quot; was published in 1977 , and , in 1978 , Norman Cousins ' book , &quot; Anatomy of an Illness , &quot; charted his triumph over illness through cheerfulness , a strong will to live and laughter . Joel Gurin , Consumer Reports editorial director , believes the work that has been done_in the PNI field has played &quot; a major part in the mainstreaming &quot; of mind / body literature . &quot; It ' s made_it more plausible , &quot; he says . * There are other factors contributing to the growth of mind / body books : PNI researcher and mind / body author Joan Borysenko says that since 80 % to 90 % of doctor visits are_due to stress and anxiety , people have begun to realize that &quot; they really need a visit to a mind / body clinic. &quot; Baby_boomers facing old_age , Miner says , are coping_with the fact that &quot; even though the body fails , we ' re living with these impediments and imperfections well into our 70s and 80s. &quot; Mind / body books , Gurin points_out , can give readers a sense of control over their own health . &quot; For many people , that diminishes the stress of having serious medical problems , &quot; he explains . The demographics of book buying are another factor_in the mind / body boom , many publishing executives say . Women , who doctors say are more open than men to alternative medical_practices , also form the great majority of book buyers . Health-care reform is also serving to lend credibility to mind / body approaches . As caregivers switch from a fee-for-service system to managed care , doctors for the first time are rewarded for saving money through preventive_medicine . Cardiologist Dean Ornish ' s program for reversing heart_disease , on which his best-selling books are based , has been endorsed by a dozen major insurers . Before , Ornish says , &quot; cardiologists might have been threatened &quot; by his system of diet , exercise , meditation and yoga . Now they &quot; embrace it because the less money they spend , the more they save. &quot; Consumer Reports ' &quot; Mind / Body Medicine : How to Use Your Mind for Better Health , &quot; written by Gurin and New York Times psychology reporter Daniel Goleman , was published last year . &quot; This was an area just reaching critical mass in terms of the amount of information there , &quot; Gurin says . &quot; It was a perfect book for Consumer Reports to do , because there ' s tremendous opportunity for half-truths and quasi-truths , yet enough known so we could tell people what was true. &quot; A compilation of chapters written by leading mind / body researchers throughout the country , Gurin and Goleman ' s book demonstrates the extent to which mind / body approaches have infiltrated the medical Establishment . Not everyone sees that as a good thing . Marcia Angell , executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine , says : &quot; What I ' m seeing is a more uncritical acceptance of the notion that you can think your way_out of diseases . To me , it ' s a form of wishful thinking. &quot; When &quot; Love , Medicine &amp; Miracles , &quot; Siegel ' s account of &quot; exceptional patients &quot; who had used love , joy and peace_of_mind to overcome cancer came_out , he was attacked by some for theories that could be interpreted to mean that cancer patients were somehow responsible_for getting , as well as curing , their disease . &quot; Doctors go_around peddling this belief , saying ' Even though we ' re saying you can think yourself out of the disease , we ' re not blaming you if you die of if , ' &quot; Angell says . &quot; that ' s nonsense , because one implies the other . I think it ' s cruel , because it ' s hard enough being_sick without being blamed for it. &quot; Still , Angell is not surprised that publishers are cranking_out mind / body books as fast as they seem to be flying off the shelves . &quot; Business is business , &quot; she says . &quot; It makes a lot of money . Everybody is looking_for the secret of everlasting life , and if you can sell a book saying that it has it , people will buy it. &quot; At UCLA , doctoring curriculum chair Michael Wilkes admits that although there is &quot; a whole_lot of hyperbole &quot; being written in the field , &quot; to not address mind / body issues is to completely miss the boat in terms of promoting health. &quot;</TEXT>
