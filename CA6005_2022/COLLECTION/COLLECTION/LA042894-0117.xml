   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : LAGUNA BEACH ; PARENTS PRESS FIGHT OVER PHONE TOWER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A dispute over a 90-foot cellular transmission tower near the playground at El Morro Elementary School has angered parents so_much that some have threatened to transfer their children to other schools . Others are vowing to fight until the tower comes_down , parents said . &quot; There ' s going_to be some bloody battles ahead , &quot; said Doug Rowe , who has two sons at the school . &quot; We will not take no for an answer . We ' re very , very determined. &quot; AirTouch Cellular , previously PacTel , installed the tower and a microwave dish in August , according to an agreement with the Laguna Beach Unified School District . The company made a concession to parents in January by removing the microwave satellite dish after parents complained that the electromagnetic_radiation emissions could pose a health risk to children . But parents have continued to lobby for the removal of the rest of the equipment , including the tower -- which allows cellular_telephones to operate in the area -- underground radio equipment and an above-ground cooling_system . They say the system is ugly and noisy , and that in leasing the land to AirTouch for $ 18 # 000 per year , the district has allowed the &quot; commercialization &quot; of school property . After receiving notice from AirTouch Cellular this week that the tower will not be removed , parents said they would meet tonight at 7 p.m. at the Wells Fargo Bank_Building in Laguna Beach to consider their next move . &quot; What happens if it gets hit by lightning ? It ' s the highest thing around , &quot; Rowe said . &quot; My phones have been ringing off_the_hook from people who are just furious . People are screaming they ' re going to take their children out of school , which is the last thing we want to have happen. &quot; David Carroll , who also has two sons at El Morro , said some parents still fear that the equipment poses a possible health risk , but most dislike the transmitter for other reasons . &quot; It is ugly , it is inappropriate , &quot; he said . &quot; We don ' t want the commercialization of the school grounds . . . . Why not put a McDonald ' s there ? Where ' s it going_to end ? &quot; But Melissa May , a spokeswoman for AirTouch Cellular in Irvine , said the equipment provides a valuable service to thousands of their customers . &quot; There ' s not going_to be any damage to anyone or anything as a result of this , &quot; she said , adding that the company has been &quot; trying very hard to educate ( the parents ) about the tower and the radio transmission. &quot; School district Supt . Paul M . Possemato said he and school_board members have met with parents and , essentially , agreed to disagree on the subject . &quot; Frankly , I can only tell them they ' re on_their_own in pursuing this , &quot; he said . &quot; We will honor our contract. &quot; LESLIE EARNEST</TEXT>
