   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; ADDING DEPTH TO ARTIST ' S LIFE ; THE BIOGRAPHICAL DRAMA DRAWS ON THE TENSION BETWEEN ALBERT P . RYDER ' S LOVE OF NATURE AND HIS HERMETIC EXISTENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What a strange painter Albert P . Ryder was . What a strange little play &quot; Ryder &quot; is . Like the miniature oils of impassioned land scapes , cloudscapes and allegories this turn-of- the-century American painter produced with obsessively slow deliberation , Michael Holmes ' biographical portrait at the Chandler Studio builds layer upon layer of emotion in a tiny space . And like Ryder himself , it is almost self-consciously Quixotic , truly determined to create rich drama out of a solitary painter ' s life , even as a host of previous artist plays and films suggest how nearly impossible that is . Indeed , the only two recent successful dramas about art-making -- Jacques Rivette ' s &quot; La Belle Noiseuse &quot; and Peter Greenaway ' s &quot; The Belly of an Architect &quot; -- work because the former devotes long stretches of playing time to the act of painting , while the latter is shot amid the actual architecture of Rome . &quot; Ryder &quot; has neither the time nor the space for any kind of you-are-there biography . Because nearly all_of Ryder ' s work was painted on such small surfaces as cigar_box lids , and because his early years are virtually undocumented , Holmes ' jobs as both adapter and director were fairly awesome . Imagine the turbulent colors , glows and movement of J.M.W. Turner ' s sky paintings mixed with the dark eddies and disturbances of Edvard Munch ' s art , and one might get a sense of this obscure painter ' s opus . But Turner ' s and Munch ' s canvases are nearly as large as their lives ; Ryder ' s life was so unadventurous that he didn ' t even do much of the then-obligatory European touring . In a reverse of the usual life-to-stage adaptation , Holmes has had to expand on this man ' s life rather than trim away detail . &quot; Ryder &quot; becomes a tale of the tension between an artist ' s love of gigantic nature and his own hermetic , claustrophobic existence in a trash-filled New York apartment . Surrounding him at various stages is a small set of wildly different friends , from the tragic Christopher ( Steve Evans ) who helped inspire perhaps Ryder ' s most distinctive and disturbing work , &quot; The Race Track , &quot; to seaman Capt . Robinson ( Rob Daniel ) to New Yorkers Charles and Louise Fitzpatrick ( James Michael Connor and Susan Savage ) who look_after Ryder like parents visiting a destitute son . Unfortunately for Joseph Dean Vachon as Ryder , most of the play takes_place during the time when Ryder almost too easily fit the stereotype of the half-crazed , tortured artist . Vachon gives a glimpse of the younger_man and his rebellious New England nature . But for too_much of the play he must flail about stage talking to himself , nervously pacing , kicking_around debris and emitting a hyena-like laugh that ' s too actorish by half . This is physically stunning stuff , but self-consciously so . It also doesn ' t make_up for not being able to view Ryder ' s paintings , which here are carefully reproduced but tiny props . Only a camera close-up might allow us a view ( though , at the end , &quot; The Race Track &quot; becomes visible as it ' s hung_on a wall ) . Thus , it ' s a stretch for the audience to grasp that Ryder is a dynamic original , in the rank of Winslow Homer . At other times , Holmes inserts superbly surprising scenes , as when Ryder is aboard Robinson ' s ship , when we can imagine nature ' s immensity nearly driving the painter to tears . &quot; Ryder &quot; might be screaming to be a film , but it contains enough moments on stage to suggest the artist ' s inner turmoil , if not his outer world . WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; Ryder. &quot; Location : Chandler Studio , 12443 Chandler Blvd. , North Hollywood . Hours : 8 p.m. Fridays through Sundays . Ends July 17 . Price : $ 12.50.
