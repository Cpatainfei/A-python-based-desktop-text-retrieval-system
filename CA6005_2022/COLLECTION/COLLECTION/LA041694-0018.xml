   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; SEX EDUCATION IN CLASSROOM BECOMES POLITICAL IN BRITAIN ; PARENTAL GROUPS ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT A GRAPHIC PAMPHLET THAT WAS HANDED_OUT TO CHILDREN AGES 9 TO 14 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sex has once again become a political issue in Great Britain -- not senior officials caught in the wrong bedroom , but rather sex education in classrooms . The center of the storm is the Health Education Authority , a semiautonomous organization that among other things oversees the instruction pamphlets used in state schools . The Conservative government of Prime_Minister John Major , already under_fire from several fronts , is being accused by traditionalists of laxity in supervising how information about sex is taught to the nation ' s students . The controversy began several weeks ago when the HEA , which underwrites publications in various health fields , gave its imprimatur to a pamphlet called &quot; The Best Sex Guide , &quot; which included graphic descriptions of oral_sex and other practices . Parental groups immediately complained and urged a far-reaching review of all sex education leaflets -- insisting that they not be issued to schoolchildren until vetted by parents and school_board governors . Under the decentralized British system , the HEA can approve health education materials , but each local school_principal decides which to use . &quot; The Best Sex Guide , &quot; which was designed for youths older than 16 , was handed_out at an afternoon school club for 9- to 14-year-olds . The book describes various sex_acts , using slang words for genitals . However , there was nothing on the cover or inside the book to indicate that it was designed for those older than 16 . Another HEA-sanctioned book , &quot; The Pocket Guide to Sex , &quot; was branded as &quot; smutty &quot; by Health Minister Brian Mawhinney , who banned it . As the original dispute simmered , another booklet approved by the HEA came_to_light called &quot; The 69 Bravest Sex Questions. &quot; It contained references_to oral and anal sex , masturbation and vibrators . It was accompanied by a computer disk called &quot; The A to Z of Love and Sex , &quot; with graphics on sexual techniques . A leading member of the HEA , the Rt . Rev . Bill Westwood , bishop of Peterborough , who complained about the earlier publication , threatened to resign if the latest booklet and disk were not withdrawn . Morals campaigner Victoria Gillick complained : &quot; This has opened_up the market to every pornographer . If they can put HEA stickers on it , they will make a fortune . It is nothing more_than a video nasty. &quot; Some members_of_Parliament also objected to the materials . Education_Secretary John Patten said the government is planning new rules that would insist on more parental involvement in the content of sex education courses and materials . &quot; There is much too_much concentration on the plumbing and mechanics , &quot; he said , &quot; and not enough on the relations of the emotions that are involved. &quot; He said sex education should begin at_home -- although almost every study has shown that most British parents are too embarrassed to explain sex to their children . Dr. David Colombi , creator of &quot; The A to Z of Love and Sex , &quot; countered that his publication &quot; contains a message I very much want to get_across -- that sex can be fun . It is not dirty or crude . It contains straightforward , factual information about sex for children , so they can decide what is right for them . &quot; I gave a demonstration of the disk a_few months ago at a sex education conference for parents , school governors and children , and they all seemed to approve it. &quot; Family_Planning Assn . Director Doreen Massey defended the distribution of sex guides to children , arguing : &quot; Young people need information . If you look_at the problem pages of any teen-age magazine , you will see much worse than anything in these books. &quot; She and others point_out that 44 % of pregnant women in Britain today are unmarried -- and a large proportion are teen-agers . But Margaret Morrisey , of the National Confederation of Parent-Teachers Assns. , which represents 10 million parents , said : &quot; This whole area needs re-examining . It is time to pull_in every leaflet that goes_out and start from scratch . Once children have been exposed to this sort of thing , we cannot erase it from their minds. &quot;</TEXT>
