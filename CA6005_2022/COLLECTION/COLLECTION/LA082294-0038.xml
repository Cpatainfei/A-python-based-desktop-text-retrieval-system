   <HEADLINE> SCREEING ROOM : TARKOVSKY ' S SUBLIME VISIONS OF LONGING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The New Beverly Cinema , 7165 Beverly Blvd. , will screen the late avant-garde Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky ' s &quot; The Mirror &quot; ( 1978 ) and &quot; Nostalghia &quot; ( 1984 ) Wednesday and Thursday . The title of the shimmering , enigmatic &quot; The Mirror &quot; could easily refer to art itself in its eternal function of holding_up a reflection to human nature so that we may see ourselves in it . With Tarkovsky , however , there ' s always a desire to see beyond this world into others -- in this instance the past , evoked through memory , imagination and dreams . Tarkovsky shifts between black-and-white and color , between past and present , in so intensely a personal way that it becomes beside the point -- and also futile -- to try to make distinctions . It ' s best to go_with the film ' s gorgeous flow , connecting with it emotionally rather than rationally . &quot; The Mirror &quot; is above all an expression of longing for the past , specifically for a mother ' s love ( and trying to find it in a wife ) , and a return to a Garden of Eden-like existence . But this is also a film with a double vision : While expressing that childhood desire for security that seems to remain in us always , it perceives its people from an adult perspective , and for all its luminosity , some of its memories are fear-laden and tragic . Tarkovsky ' s films invite us to experience what we ' re seeing , to perceive a universe in which the line blurs between the natural and the supernatural . This radiant , sublime dream of a film begins with a televised scene of a therapist in the process of curing a stuttering young boy . If we are to take this scene as a metaphor , then &quot; The Mirror &quot; can be regarded_as the work of a man who has found his voice and learned to express himself in his own powerful way . Tarkovsky felt that nostalgia has a richer , more complex meaning to Russians -- &quot; one that mixes the love of your homeland and the melancholy that arises from being far away. &quot; Although the film is a profound expression of Tarkovsky ' s own exile longings , it gives_way to larger concerns when its poet-hero ( Oleg Yankovsky ) , during an Italian odyssey , meets a &quot; madman &quot; ( Erland Josephson ) who protests against the disjointedness of society and professes the need to return to a simpler form of life . Above all , &quot; Nostalghia &quot; gives intense visual expression to the poet ' s increasingly desperate search for meaning and for a reconciliation of past ( Russia ) and present ( Italy ) . In its stately , measured way &quot; Nostalghia , &quot; in its culminating spirit of affirmation , becomes akin to a religious experience . Information : ( 213 ) 938-4038 . The Evils of War : John Woo ' s &quot; Bullet in the Head &quot; ( 1990 ) , a powerful , dynamic variation on &quot; The Deer Hunter , &quot; returns Wednesday to the Monica 4-Plex for a one-week run . At once an epic adventure , war picture , gangster melodrama and buddy movie , it features three petty Hong Kong crooks who in 1967 take_off for Vietnam , where wartime dangers are equaled only by the opportunities to acquire illicit fortunes ; their fate symbolizes the evils of the war itself . Information : ( 310 ) 394-9741 . Senegalese Duo : The Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center , 681 Venice Blvd. , Venice , will present Ousmane Sembene ' s &quot; Black Girl &quot; ( 1966 ) and &quot; Borom Street &quot; ( 1964 ) on Saturday at 8 p.m. What is so overpowering about both films is the understated matter-of-factness with which Sembene shows the casual cruelties and routine injustices that are the result of whites ' ancient oppression of blacks . Both have been made with unflinching directness and simplicity . In the first , a beautiful young Senegalese woman ( Nbissine Therese Diop ) is hired in Dakar by a French couple to care_for their three children . Unfortunately , she accompanies the family back to France , where she becomes a virtual slave , and her employers simply forget that she is a human_being . It is Sembene ' s major achievement that everything that happens is totally credible -- that the_French couple could be so thoroughly monstrous and exploitative without realizing it for a second . &quot; Borom Street , &quot; a devastating portrayal of the evils of apartheid , will bring_to mind &quot; The Bicycle Thief. &quot; In this 19-minute film , Sembene ' s first , we meet a Senegalese cart man ( Ly Abdoulaye ) on his daily_rounds . His troubles begin when he lets another black_man persuade him to transport the man to the forbidden , magnificent white section of Dakar . Information : ( 310 ) 822-3006 .</TEXT>
