   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : GLENDALE ; TRIBUTE PLANNED FOR SILENT FILM PIONEER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Historians and film buffs will pay tribute next month to a female pioneer of the silent cinema who was known for adventurous epics in which women often saved the day -- and they ' ll use the filmmaker ' s turn-of-the-century Glendale home for the site of the event . From 1912 to 1924 Nell Shipman starred in , wrote , directed and independently produced a series of silent_movies noted for their strong-willed heroines , outdoor scenes and the use of trained wild animals . With interest in Shipman ' s career growing , the Glendale Historical Society will pay tribute to the filmmaker at the Doctor ' s House , a Queen Anne home where Shipman lived from 1917 to 1920 . &quot; People have been looking_back recently and admiring her work , &quot; said Terry Richman , an organizer of the event . &quot; She was very progressive . The lead character was usually a woman . She also loved the wilderness , and scenery was a big part of her films , whereas most people were filming in studios. &quot; The Doctor ' s House , which got its moniker because a succession of Glendale doctors lived there during the early 1900s , was located on Wilson Avenue when Shipman and her family called it home . It was moved to Brand Park in the 1980s for preservation by the historical society as a landmark . The Shipman tribute , which will run four consecutive Sundays beginning Oct . 2 , will feature docent-guided tours of the house , publicity and family photographs , movie stills , posters , magazine_articles and the showing of a video of one of her movies . Much of the background information the historical society has compiled on Shipman ' s life came from interviews with Shipman ' s son Barry , also a prolific screenwriter , who recently died . Shipman , who died in 1970 at age 78 , has also been researched by film scholars in recent years , and her autobiography has been published . Her biggest film was &quot; Back to God ' s Country , &quot; which was filmed in Canada and released in 1919 . Shown internationally , the film made a 300 % profit . Shipman also founded her own production company , opening a film studio in Idaho that was large enough to house the animals that appeared in her movies . She stopped making films in 1925 but continued to write novels and magazine_articles for years , Richman said . The Doctor ' s House is at 1601 Mountain St. , Glendale . The exhibit will be open from 1 to 4 p.m. Oct . 2 , and from 2 to 4 p.m. the following three Sundays . STEVE RYFLE</TEXT>
