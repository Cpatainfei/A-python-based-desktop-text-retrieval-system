   <TEXT> Nearly a year after taking_office and with his popularity at an all-time high , Prime_Minister Jean Chretien is making his first moves toward attacking Canada ' s mountainous public_debt , among the largest in the industrialized world . In two days of hearings before a parliamentary committee this week , Finance_Minister Paul Martin set deficit-cutting as the government ' s top fiscal priority . While declining to provide many specifics , Martin called_for sacrifice across the spectrum of Canadian society , which has developed an extensive welfare_state over the last 30 years . Martin said he is determined to reduce the federal budget_deficit to 3 % of gross_domestic_product within two years &quot; come hell or high_water &quot; and set an ultimate goal of zero deficit . He refused to rule_out tax increases but noted that &quot; Canadians believe that they already are taxed to the hilt. &quot; Chretien followed up with an appearance on &quot; Canada A.M. , &quot; a morning television_news show . &quot; We have to adjust the system to the realities of today , &quot; he told anchorman Keith Morrison . &quot; Too many people have become too dependent_on government. &quot; These comments came less than two weeks after Human Resources Minister Lloyd Axworthy released a &quot; discussion paper &quot; of proposed reforms for Canada ' s social_services , including reduced federal support for welfare , unemployment insurance and university education . The question now is how -- or whether -- Chretien will follow the rhetoric with action . The anti-deficit hard line is a sharp turnaround for his Liberal_Party . In last year ' s election campaign , which swept them to power and ended the nine-year reign of the Progressive Conservatives , the Liberals emphasized job creation , suggesting that the economy could grow out of the deficit . But once in office , Chretien , like President Clinton , found hoped-for programs to reshape the national economy and diminish child poverty held hostage by the increasing share of federal revenue used to pay interest on the debt . Canada ' s public_debt is about $ 700 billion , nearly equal_to its gross_domestic_product . By contrast , the U.S. debt is about 70 % of GDP . The most persistent criticism of Chretien in his first year was that he did little to tackle the deficit or Canada ' s other significant problems . Nonetheless , the economy has improved , and Chretien ' s approval ratings in the polls are above 60 % and rising . Jeffrey Simpson , a columnist for the Globe &amp; Mail national newspaper and one of the country ' s leading political analysts , believes that Chretien ' s unquestioned integrity and low-key style account_for much of his popularity . But , Simpson said , the prime_minister ' s unambitious agenda also helped ; Canadians may have been looking_for an interregnum after more_than a decade of aggressive , often controversial leadership by former prime_ministers Brian Mulroney and Pierre Elliott Trudeau . &quot; For a year now , they ' re consulting , they ' re reviewing , they ' re preparing , they ' re quarter-mastering themselves for the battles to come , &quot; Simpson said of Chretien ' s team . &quot; we ' ll see how many battles they ' ll actually fight. &quot; And there figures to be a battle if the government goes_ahead with cuts . Business_leaders , economists and anti-poverty advocates are already raising the decibel level over whether the deficit should be closed by tightening programs or increasing taxes . As the debate plays_out , Chretien will have to balance it with his campaign to keep Quebec ' s separatist government from winning a referendum on independence in the province some time next year . Serious cutbacks in popular programs will be used by the separatists to try to persuade Quebeckers they have little to lose by leaving Canada . Climbing Government Debt Interest on Canada ' s federal debt is accumulating at $ 85 # 000 per minute , 24 hours a day . Spending_cuts and / or tax increases are the nation ' s main alternatives to promote growth and decrease debt .
