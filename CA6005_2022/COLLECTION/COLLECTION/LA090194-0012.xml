   <HEADLINE> WINE : ADRIFT IN A SEA OF WINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More good has happened for wine drinkers in the last 20 years than in the previous 200 , but the good news is tempered by the confusion that now exists in the wide world of wine . Not so_long ago , there were three kinds of wine : excellent , drinkable and poor . Excellent wine ( the top Bordeaux chateaux , a handful of Burgundy producers , the best German and Italian estates and a very few top-rate American and Australian wineries ) accounted_for a tiny proportion , drinkable wine for somewhat more . But most of the world ' s wine was pretty poor and ( justifiably ) unknown outside its own neighborhood . Technology -- in the vineyard , in the winery and in shipping -- has changed all that . For one thing , the bottom rung of the old three-level system is all but gone ; so little truly poor wine is made now that it is a negligible part of the industry . Today fine and even exceptional wines come from places that previously never dreamed of making anything more_than the local populace could swig . This means that demand for these improved wines has increased , prompting their sale thousands of miles from their points of production . As if this wasn ' t enough to cram the shelves with good wine , along came the breakup of the Soviet_Union , making_possible the import of wines from former Soviet satellites , such_as Hungary , Bulgaria , Slovenia and Romania . Then apartheid got kicked_in the teeth , making South_African wines suddenly an import item . Add_to this the rapid rise of quality wine from New York , Texas , Washington , Oregon , New Mexico , Virginia , even Missouri . Factor_in the rapid improvement of Chilean wines , the internationalization of vineyards in Spain and Italy ( with new plantings of Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon ) and the more sophisticated marketing of top-rate wines from Australia . What today ' s consumer faces is a veritable forest of bottles with unfamiliar names . The wine_lover suffers from that cliched problem , an embarrassment of riches . How do you keep track of all these new wines ? Indeed , how do you even find_out about them ? Experimentation is one way . Ask wine_merchants or knowledgeable waiters to recommend something new and very good to go_with the food you ' re planning to eat . But be prepared to be surprised by what you find . I usually am . You may_not have heard of a &quot; new &quot; property , yet it may be quite old . Other wines come from regions you may never have heard of , or from &quot; wineries &quot; that don ' t even exist -- some &quot; wineries &quot; these days are simply wine brands , such_as the Forest Ville brand that Bronco Wine Co . markets . Bronco owns neither vineyards nor a place to make wine but contracts for grapes to be delivered to a winery where space is leased to crush and ferment the wine . Other new winery-less brands blend wine purchased from bulk wine brokers . Some of the best new labels on the shelf are from newcomers who have developed new wineries on existing vineyards . Among these are excellent producers with names such_as Von Strasser , Araujo , Viader , Peter Michael , Fife , Bayview Cellars , Benton-Lane , Seavey and Random Ridge . * And finally there are brands that exist as second labels , allowing the primary producer the luxury of selling lesser wines at a lower price , brands such_as Bell Canyon ( Burgess Cellars ) ; Bel Arbors ( Fetzer ) ; Canyon Road ( Geyser Peak ) , C.K. Mondavi ( Charles Krug ) ; Counterpoint and Terra Rosa ( Laurel Glen ) ; Hawk Crest ( Stag ' s Leap Wine_Cellars ) ; Gavilan ( Chalone ) , and Liberty School ( Caymus Vineyards ) . So yes , it is confusing . But today , adventuresome consumers can have good , fairly priced wine in almost every price range -- wine that ' s better than it ' s ever been .</TEXT>
