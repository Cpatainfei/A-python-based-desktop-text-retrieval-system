   <TEXT> &quot; T he Americans are certainly great hero_worshipers , and always take their heroes from the criminal classes . &quot; Oscar Wilde made that observation while on a lecture tour that brought him to St . Joseph , Mo. , during the frenzied aftermath of the April 3 , 1882 , slaying there of famed bank robber and killer Jesse James . In a letter dated 16 days after James ' death , Wilde mused about the merchandising of the outlaw ' s possessions -- his dustbin and foot scraper had been auctioned the day before , and crowds were gathering from some distance to bid on his door knocker . But even if Wilde had sent his letter by telegraph , he was lagging behind the news . On April 12 , a 200-page book titled &quot; The Life and Career of Frank and Jesse James , &quot; written in seven days by the owner of the St . Joseph News , had arrived in_stores , and sold_out the same day . On April 13 , an entrepreneurial scavenger in Chicago was selling swatches of blood-soaked carpet taken from James ' cottage . And though the killers , Robert and Charley Ford , were charged with first-degree murder , they had already appeared on stage in Kansas City -- for a fee of $ 100 each -- to recount their deed for a rapt audience at the Theatre Comique . If you wonder what this scene might look_like today , with our instantaneous high-tech communications , tabloid media competition , and free-wheeling free_enterprise , think_back no farther than the weeks following the murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman . Or wait until Friday and buy a ticket to Oliver Stone ' s &quot; Natural Born Killers. &quot; &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; is a two-hour fever dream about the commercialization of violence in contemporary America , the story of bad-to-the-bone lovers Mickey ( Woody Harrelson ) and Mallory ( Juliette Lewis ) who go_on a two-week killing spree that turns them into pop icons , media darlings and consumer products . The nation ' s attention is as riveted on M &amp; M as it was periodically riveted during the production of the movie on Joey and Amy , Tonya and Nancy , the Menendez brothers , the Bobbitts and , lately , on O.J. and Nicole . &quot; We were just having a lot of fun making this movie when it started to happen in real_life , &quot; says Stone . &quot; It was so bizarre , week after week , to see these soap_operas unfold , to see the news get more into the entertainment ratings game. &quot; Bizarre , and fortuitous . Stone , calling_upon every demon and conspiratorial urge in his arsenal , has made what he calls a satire on &quot; the crazy American landscape &quot; where the media so glorify their villains that they have collectively become the greater demon . The film has so many parallels to recent media events , particularly the &quot; Go O.J. ! &quot; signs seen during the Friday Night Bronco Ride , that it transcends coincidence and seems to cut_to the nature of mankind itself . The media are just one of Stone ' s targets . Every principal character in the film is a monster -- Mickey , Mallory , the father ( Rodney Dangerfield ) who abused her , the homicidal cop ( Tom Sizemore ) chasing them , the ratings-obsessed British tabloid TV journalist ( Robert Downey Jr. , with the voice of Robin Leach ) panting to interview them , the prison warden ( Tommy Lee Jones ) anxious to punish them , and the variety of rednecks , would-be rapists and slothful fools murdered by them . If this movie is correct , we celebrate criminals in our society because we envy their freedom to act_out urges the rest of us natural born losers suppress and deny . &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; is too late to serve as a cautionary tale , says Stone ; we ' re there . Just as the movie obliterates the lines between real and fictional violence , and between legitimate news and exploitation , those lines have been obliterated in real_life . Technology and the almighty dollar have herded us all into a hellish corral where we are either committing ghastly crimes or being entertained by commercially sponsored details of those committed by others , and then lionizing the culprits ! Stone , as he did with &quot; JFK , &quot; has rounded_up far too many suspects , and his entire case may be just as false . And &quot; Natural Born Killers ' &quot; dizzying psychedelic blend of violence and smash-cut , multimedia imagery may leave some people feeling faint from stimulus abuse . But you ' ve got_to love him . Stone is the most provocative filmmaker of his time , and whether his latest movie excites or repulses its audiences , it raises enough issues to keep the Op-Ed pages churning for weeks . Are things really this bad ? Is man as basically evil as Oliver Stone movies imply ? Under the tenets of free speech and free_enterprise , and with today ' s technology , could any society in history have avoided arriving_at this place ? And isn ' t &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; guilty of the very things it condemns ? &quot; I think it is ( guilty ) , &quot; says Jane Hamsher , one of the film ' s producers . &quot; What I like about it is that it shows that violence is very seductive and that watching violence in movies is very enjoyable . You feel dirty for having felt that , and you can ' t walk away from it . You have to recognize it as part of yourself. &quot; Don Murphy , who with Hamsher optioned the original Quentin Tarantino script for &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; ( it was rewritten by Stone and two others , and Tarantino now disavows it ) , says that the movie merely &quot; holds a mirror up_to culture and says , ' Look , if you accept tabloid journalism and the deification of killers . . . this is where you can end up. ' &quot; Says Stone : &quot; I ' m reflecting back with exaggeration . that ' s my stand. &quot; The media follow-up questions to &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; do loom large . With the communications industry undergoing major shakeouts , and the survival of many media companies at stake , the ratings game is likely to continue coloring news judgment . The &quot; tell them what they need to know , not what they want to know &quot; maxim once drilled into freshman journalism students has been turned_on its head . From USA Today to &quot; A Current Affair , &quot; the new journalism follows the lead of entertainment -- find_out what they want , give it to them quickly , promise them more -- and their success has rippled through the mustiest corridors of news . Even the New York Times put Tonya Harding on Page 1 . The question of blurred lines is crucial . When people can no longer tell the difference between fact and fiction , we can fold the tent . And that seems a genuine possibility , not so_much because of excessive violence in conventional television and film drama , but from the exploitation of real tragedy and violence in TV news and such shows as &quot; America ' s Most Wanted &quot; and &quot; Cops. &quot; &quot; People who assert that there ' s no link between television violence and violence in society are deluded , &quot; says psychologist Gerald Davison , interim dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern California . &quot; It ' s a known psychological fact that if you present something awful to a person again and again , especially if it ' s glamorized , the person is going_to become desensitized. &quot; You can blame the media , as &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; does , and come_up with nothing but a doomsday prognosis , a vicious_cycle of greed , aggression and disintegrating values . Mickey and Mallory know the power of the media they control , and how to manipulate it ; the most dangerous weapons in the film are the video cameras -- security-mounted in_stores , or hand-held by TV crews -- that provide the killers their stage . But if we step outside that bleak circle drawn by the movie , society seems neither as damned as it appears nor human nature quite as callous . The erosion of family values is a major concern , but most of us do not abuse our children and turn them into killers , most cops do not imitate the crimes they ' re trying to solve , and the better media still cover the larger issues , arguably better than ever . Stone ' s comment that do-gooders aren ' t news anymore is wrong ; coverage of the Rwandans in Africa , not exactly a money story to begin with , has been laced with features about outsiders who raced there to help save lives . And you only have to imagine what might have happened at Tian An Men Square , if the rest of the world weren ' t watching it live , to appreciate the positive impact of instant information . The questions raised about human nature are just as tricky , recalling the timeless philosophical debate : Are we basically good and have to learn bad behavior , or basically bad and have to develop moral codes in_order to survive ? Part of the answer may be found in another summer movie , Robert Zemeckis ' &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; and in its astonishing appeal_to millions of moviegoers . The film is a simple fable about a mildly retarded man who , while living through some of America ' s most troubled and soul-searching times , not only maintains his innocence but flourishes and prospers in the shadow of ignorance . It is ironic for a society that has often treated mental deficients as disposable humanity to suddenly embrace one so wholeheartedly , and it ' s tempting to read &quot; Gump ' s &quot; success as a sign that we ' re tiring of the constant diet of anti-heroes and thugs . &quot; I think there is a yearning among both adults and young people for something simple and pure , and ' Gump ' does tap into that , &quot; says Washington clinical_psychologist Karen Shanor . &quot; We can empathize with him , even though we don ' t know what he ' s feeling . The frills are gone ; he is an adult scaled_down to an idealistic child , and he exemplifies that humanness and goodness that is inside each of us . In some people , you have to look pretty hard because they don ' t have the opportunity . But it ' s there. &quot; Under the microscope , &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; and &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; are both pretty simple organisms . They are fantastic views of life from opposite extremes , one giddily light and optimistic , the other morbidly dark and foreboding , neither one graced with many shades of gray . One is an outright escape , the other a head-on assault , and they tap opposing chords in us . Though Stone has portrayed Mickey and Mallory as products of their time , all that really separates them from celebrity outlaws of the past are the accouterments of modern media . Jesse James , Billy the Kid , Bonnie and Clyde . . . they were all feared and , in some quarters , admired . But it ' s a little hysterical to say the preoccupation with killers is peculiar to America . It is peculiar to human history . You can find parallels to &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; in Greek_mythology and theater , where heinous acts were routinely enacted and their perpetrators literally deified . They became gods . &quot; Ancient societies were warrior societies , there was a kind of cultural investment in violence that made_it normal , &quot; says Vincent Ferenga , who teaches comparative_literature at USC . &quot; Anyone who excelled_at being violent in warfare was going_to enjoy a kind of privileged class. &quot; Ferenga says that Greek society had rigid purification rituals for soldiers returning to society , but they were fascinated with what happened when those rituals failed , when violence spilled_over into everyday life , and that aberrant behavior often provided grist for the Oliver Stones of the day , the playwrights . &quot; The Greeks were unique in creating the theater as a place where you could talk_about and dramatize actions you couldn ' t deal with anywhere else , &quot; says Ferenga . &quot; Murder and sexual crimes between family members -- fratricide , matricide , infanticide , incest . The worst crimes possible are in those stories. &quot; What distinguishes those plays from today ' s news and dramatic programming is that Greeks didn ' t allow acts of violence themselves to be seen , for fear they would arouse excitement and prompt imitative behavior . Ferenga said that a riot at one Greek play based on a contemporary event nipped a budding movie-of-the-week mentality , and from then on , playwrights stuck_to myths and metaphors . Plato , beating the Rev . Donald Wildmon to the punch by more_than 2 # 300 years , argued that theater and storytelling should be banned altogether , lest they provoke feelings and passions detrimental to society and rational thought . If he could see us now . . . . &quot; Plato would certainly feel that this is the ultimate end of reasonable and civilized life , &quot; Ferenga laughs . Ancient societies were state-run , of course . If free_enterprise had been allowed to flourish , and they had their own dueling &quot; Current Affairs &quot; and National Enquirers paying witnesses and buying news , who knows how much sooner we might have met Mickey and Mallory ? What ' s new right now , other_than the fact that we can watch dramatic_events unfold in real time , with the outcomes unknown ( &quot; Will O.J. shoot himself or not ? &quot; ) , is that the media are beginning to examine and exploit themselves . Besides &quot; Natural Born Killers , &quot; there was the recent Belgian film &quot; Man Bites Dog , &quot; a pseudo-documentary about a film crew that follows a serial_killer on his rounds and becomes his eager accomplice , and this fall we ' ll see the release of &quot; S.F.W. , &quot; a movie about a man who is caught in , and changed by , a media-covered hostage crisis in a convenience_store . Sociologist Todd Gitlin , who teaches a course in the structure of mass communications at UC Berkeley , says that these films are part of a new &quot; culture industry &quot; thriving on self-examination . &quot; Academics get_off on studying them , &quot; he says ; &quot; you and I get_off on writing_about them. &quot; Well , it has been fun , and our thanks to Oliver Stone for providing the opportunity . Just one more thing , though . Stone and his producers say that the great irony and strength of &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; is that audiences end_up rooting for Mickey and Mallory because the forces lined_up against them -- that is , the rest of society -- are so corrupt . It is true that America doesn ' t produce many traditional heroes anymore , and that a hero without an agent is soon forgotten . It ' s also true that a society largely committed to the cults of celebrity and wealth is easily seduced . Still , the vast majority of Americans are appalled by crime and criminals , as the vast majorities of civilized societies always have , and they will be appalled by Mickey and Mallory . With apologies to Oscar Wilde and Oliver Stone , there is a wide gulf between innate curiosity and devil worship. * * HE ' S A NATURAL Rodney Danger- field takes_on his first dramatic role in Oliver Stone ' s &quot; Natural Born Killers. &quot; Page 24</TEXT>
