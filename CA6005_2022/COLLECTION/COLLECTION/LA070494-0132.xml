   <HEADLINE> QUAKE FUNERAL GRANTS EXCEED OFFICIAL TOLL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The official death toll for the Northridge earthquake was 58 , yet the state has received 374 requests for grants to pay funeral expenses for quake victims , records show . The state already has awarded disaster-related funeral grants for 117 people , including one man who hanged himself over the loss of his job from the Jan . 17 quake and another who died of valley_fever more_than two months after the temblor . The deceased for whom grants were given ranged_in age from a prematurely born baby to a 94-year-old heart_attack victim . More_than half the deaths were caused by heart_attacks that followed the earthquake or aftershocks . So far , the total bill to taxpayers is $ 431 # 129 , and 138 requests for funeral grants are pending . Under a little-known disaster relief program , anyone -- regardless of personal_income -- can receive up_to $ 6 # 000 for burial and $ 2 # 500 for cremation of family members whose deaths were directly attributable to the quake or hastened by the disaster . The program , just a small part of nearly $ 12 billion in federal quake relief , is administered by the state . If a doctor determines the death to be disaster-related , &quot; we don ' t question it , &quot; said Liz Brady of the state_Department of Social_Services . Funeral grants are available only to those without other financial_aid , such_as private insurance or assistance from the Red_Cross , which helped pay_for 14 quake-related funerals . State officials , citing privacy laws , refused to identify the dead or the doctors who certified the deaths as quake-related . But interviews and documents obtained under the California Public Records Act show that the families of about half the 58 quake victims identified by coroner ' s offices in Southern California received funeral grants . Among these victims were people killed in car accidents and trapped in collapsed buildings , including the Northridge Meadows Apartments , where 16 perished . Many quake victims whose families received grants were in fragile health and died of &quot; earthquake-related stress , &quot; officials said . Among those afforded government-paid funerals was a man who hanged himself May 17 . His doctor said he was despondent because he lost his job after the quake , state officials said . A grant also went_to the family of a woman who died of cancer in March in Arizona . The 83-year-old woman was in Northridge the day of the quake and suffered broken ribs and a crushed spine . Because of the cancer , &quot; she apparently wasn ' t able to heal properly , &quot; Brady said . One grant was paid to the family of a truck_driver who died April 3 of valley_fever . Some health officials have said the quake may have churned_up the fungus-laden dust that causes the respiratory illness . But a local health official said the truck_driver ' s death was more likely caused by his frequent travel_to the San Joaquin Valley , where valley_fever is endemic . &quot; The doctor certified it was earthquake-related , &quot; Brady said . &quot; We ' re not in a position . . . to refute a doctor ' s statement. &quot; The government also paid the funeral expenses of a person who died of exposure after refusing out of fear to go inside after the quake . And it paid_for the funeral of a person who died when his kidney dialysis_machine failed during a blackout . Most of the deaths occurred in the San Fernando Valley , but they were scattered throughout Los Angeles and Ventura counties . A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner said that he was surprised at the number of funeral grants but that his office is in &quot; no position to refute &quot; a doctor ' s finding that a death was quake-related . &quot; Who are we to say ? &quot; said spokesman Scott Carrier . &quot; We ' re not here to police the doctors. &quot; The Los Angeles County coroner counted 57 casualties from the quake -- a figure also used as the official death toll by the state Office of Emergency Services . The San Bernardino County coroner ' s office reported one quake-related death -- a woman who was &quot; scared to death , &quot; said a coroner ' s official , but that death does not qualify for a funeral grant because the presidential disaster declaration is limited to Los Angeles , Orange and Ventura counties . No quake-related deaths were reported by coroners in Orange and Ventura counties . One explanation for the difference between the official toll and the number of funeral grants given is that the coroner ' s office does not investigate every death . The coroner is required to investigate deaths of people who had not seen a physician for 60 days or died as a result of trauma , such_as being trapped in a collapsed building . But deaths from natural causes , such_as heart_attacks , are not routinely subject_to coroner ' s review , and determination of whether the death was quake-related is left to the attending physician . The Los Angeles County coroner ' s list also does not include any deaths that occurred after Jan . 25 . &quot; We had no other cases reported to us , &quot; Carrier said . After Hurricane Andrew , Florida officials limited payouts to deaths that occurred within 48 hours of the hurricane . They issued a dozen funeral grants . California has never placed a time_limit on funeral grants for disaster-related deaths . State officials noted that a body was recovered from a collapsed freeway more_than 48 hours after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 . The state issued 41 funeral grants in that quake , which claimed 63 lives . Not all requests for funeral grants have been approved . One was denied to the family of a man who died on a golf_course shortly after the Northridge earthquake . &quot; The doctor would n ' t certify it was earthquake-related because it was a pre-existing condition , &quot; Brady said . In addition , state officials said they received a number of requests for funeral aid to bury pets . &quot; At least we denied the request for the horse funeral and dog funeral , &quot; said Scott Gregerson of the Department of Social_Services . Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency , which provides the bulk of the money for the funeral grants , said they were satisfied with the state ' s administration of the funeral grant program . FEMA officials said they leave it up_to states to determine who qualifies for grants , although the agency later will review the payments . Eligible expenses include funeral_home costs , purchasing plots , transporting the body or ashes , death certificates , one spray of flowers and memorial markers . Ineligible are special clothing , transportation for family members and reception expenses . A state official suggested that perhaps the state should refer its list to the coroner &quot; to decide if they should revise the death toll. &quot;</TEXT>
